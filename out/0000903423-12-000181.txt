  EXHIBIT B
   
  False Claims Act
   
  With respect to paragraph 7 of this certificate, the U.S. Government is conducting a civil investigation under the False Claims Act into whether originators, depositors, servicers, or trustees of residential mortgage-backed securities (“ RMBS
”) trusts submitted false claims for payment by  government purchasers of RMBS by (1) concealing that the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose; (2) charging RMBS trusts for fraudulent loan processing services, including the preparation of fraudulent mortgage assignments; and (3) failing to ensure that the RMBS trusts paid necessary real estate mortgage investment conduit (“ REMIC
”) taxes.  Certain states may be conducting similar investigations.  The investigation may involve RMBS trusts in which current or former Bank of America affiliates, including BAC Home Loans Servicing LP, Bank of America Mortgage Securities, Inc., Countrywide Financial Corporation, and Bank of America, N.A. as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank, served as originator, depositor, servicer, or trustee.  The U.S. government’s investigation is also considering whether participants in RMBS trusts defrauded federal mortgage insurers, including the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development by submitting claims for loan guarantee payments on loans for which the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose.
   
  Investigations under the federal and most state False Claims Acts may be initiated by the applicable government investigative body or by a qui tam 
relator’s filing of a False Claims Act complaint under court seal.  If a qui tam 
relator’s complaint remained under seal, applicable law would restrict our ability to disclose such a fact.

  Bank of America, National Association is a named party in litigation involving Ocala Funding, LLP.  Information about this litigation is publicly disclosed in Bank of America Corporation’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings.
   
  Fifth Third v. Concord Capital Management et al.
   
  Bank of America, National Association (“ Bank of America
”) was named as a co-defendant in a suit filed in September 2010 by Concord Capital Management LLC and affiliated parties (collectively, “ Concord
”) in the New York State Supreme Court against Bank of America (as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association), Fifth Third Bank (“ Fifth Third
”) and other parties. The suit alleged gross negligence and breach of contract by Bank of America, acting as collateral agent, servicer and, until the transfer of such role to Wilmington Trust Company in February 2009, the trustee, in connection with a life insurance premium-financing loan facility known as “Ultra”, established by Concord and financed by Fifth Third.
   
  In November 2011, Fifth Third filed an amended complaint in Illinois State Court naming Concord, Bank of America and certain other parties, as defendants. Fifth Third’s lawsuit alleges breach of contract and gross negligence by Bank of America based on assertions about Bank of America’s duties substantially similar to those previously made by Concord in New York State Court.
   
  Bank of America’s motion to dismiss against Concord was granted on December 5, 2011. The Fifth Third lawsuit is ongoing.
   
      
 
     
    
 
     
 
 
  Nightingale Properties, LLC et al. vs. Bank of America, N.A., et al.
   
  Bank of America was named as a co-defendant with CW Capital Asset Management LLC (“ CWC
”) in suits filed in Tennessee State Court (in February 2011) New York State Court (in August 2011) and Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York (in December 2011) by the Nightingale Group, LLC and related parties (collectively, “ Nightingale
”). Each of the actions arose as a consequence of the default of four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust, 2008-C1, and the filing by CWC on behalf of Bank of America of a collection suit in Tennessee against Nightingale and its owners/guarantors, which resulted in a receivership.
   
  The Tennessee and New York State complaints allege libel by CWC, as servicer, allegedly acting as agent of Bank of America, as trustee with respect to the LB-UBS Trust, arising from the publication by CWC of certain statements relating to the guarantee given by Nightingale in support of payment on the four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Trust. The Federal District Court complaint alleges breach of contract, intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, fraud, promissory estoppel and a RICO claim CWC and Bank of America.

  Exhibit 31.3
   
  
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
   
  Reference is made to the Trust Agreement, between MSDW Structured Asset Corp., as Depositor and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, as successor-in-interest to Bank of America, National Association, as Trustee, as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association, as Trustee, for SATURNS Trust No. 2001-6, dated July 16, 2001, together with Schedules I, II and III attached thereto, and the Standard Terms for Trust Agreements, between MSDW Structured Asset Corp., as Depositor and Chase Bank of Texas, National Association, as Trustee, dated July 7, 1999.  
Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings defined in the Trust Agreement and the Standard Terms for Trust Agreements.
   
  In connection with the preparation and delivery of the annual report on Form 10-K of MS Structured Asset Corp. on behalf of SATURNS Trust No. 2001-6 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 (“Fiscal Year”) and the certifications given by In-Young Chase with respect thereto, the undersigned hereby certifies that she is a duly elected Vice President of U.S. Bank National Association (the “Trustee”) and further certifies in her capacity as such as follows:
   
      1.  
 
  I have reviewed the reports on Form 8-K containing the reports to Unitholders included on Exhibit A (the “U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports”) for the year covered by this annual report of MS Structured Asset Corp., on behalf of SATURNS Trust No. 2001-6;
 
 
 
   
      2.  
 
  Based on my knowledge, the reporting information in the U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports, taken as a whole, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading as of the date that the distribution information was filed on Form 8-K or Form 8-KA, as applicable.
 
 
 
   
      3.  
 
  Based on my knowledge, the reporting information required to be provided in the U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports under the Trust Agreement, is included in the U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports;
 
 
 
   
      4.  
 
  I am familiar with the operations of U.S. Bank National Association with respect to the SATURNS program and SATURNS Trust No. 2001-6 and the requirement imposed by the Trust Agreement, based on my knowledge, and except as disclosed in the U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports, for the applicable periods (as outlined in Exhibit B attached hereto), the Trustee has fulfilled its obligations under the Trust Agreement.
 
 
 
   
      5.  
 
  Based on my knowledge, and except as disclosed in this Compliance Statement or the U.S. Bank Reviewed Distribution Reports, there are no material legal proceedings with respect to the trust, involving the trust or U.S. Bank National Association as trustee.
