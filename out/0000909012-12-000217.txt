PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Business Development
 
Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. (“ACOR”,
“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in British Columbia, Canada,
in April of 1997. The Company’s U.S. office is located at 1301 Avenue M, Cisco, Texas 76437. Our website address is www.aussieoil.com.
The information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated into, this Annual
Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”)
 
The Company has continued to be active with
its Working Interests and overriding royalty positions held both domestically and internationally. The business of ACOR during
2011 was to work on its existing Working Interest projects as well as study the oil and gas exploration acreage available in Australia
in basins that demonstrate a high probability of success with the maximum rate of return for dollars invested. For additional information
on our acquisition of additional Working Interests in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland, Australia see Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
 
Current Business Operations
 
The Company is a purchaser and holder of both
Overriding Royalty Interests and Working Interests both on an international and domestic basis. ACOR’s business is related
to the principal products of oil and gas, and is dependent on various factors, which are discussed below. The average sales price
per barrel of oil from the Company’s interests located in Australia during 2011 was $114.35.
 
The acquisition, exploration, development, production
and sale of oil and gas are subject to many factors that are outside the Company’s control. These factors include: market
prices; national and international economic conditions; import and export quotas; availability of drilling rigs, casing, pipe,
and other equipment and supplies; availability of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities; the supply and
price of competitive fuels; and the regulation of prices, production, transportation, and marketing by domestic and foreign governmental
authorities. Additionally, the Company generally has no control over whether the owner or operator of leases to which its Overriding
Royalty Interests are attributable will elect to explore for oil and gas on such properties, or to develop them following discoveries
that may occur. Each of these factors may affect the rate at which oil and gas are produced on properties in which the Company
has an interest or affect whether wells will be drilled on such properties, and could otherwise materially affect ACOR’s
earnings.
 
Due to extreme flooding most exploration activities
were cancelled or delayed on the Company’s Australian interests during 2011. However, one well was drilled on one of the
Company’s interests, which was completed as a producer. For further information on each of the Company’s interests
see "Item 2. Properties".
     
     
Proposed Future Business Operations
 
The Company’s strategy
is three fold: 1) to seek Overriding Royalty Interests in oil and gas concessions within sedimentary basins in Australia, 2) to
explore and develop the oil and gas concessions in Queensland, Australia in which it holds a Working Interest and 3) to seek other
Working Interests in oil and gas concessions within sedimentary basins of Australia to promote oil and gas exploration through
seismic programs and drilling operations.
 
The Company’s ability to explore other
oil and gas opportunities is dependent on adequate capital resources being available and equity being obtained, and/or finding
partners to fund the exploration and drilling programs on the areas in which the Company holds Working Interests.
 
Competition
 
The Company is competing with other oil companies
for oil and gas leases and concessions. The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all of its phases, with competition for
favorable producing royalties, overriding royalties, and good oil and gas leases being particularly intense. The Company believes
that the exploration program, promised expenditures, geological and geophysical skill, and familiarity with an area of operations
are the primary competitive factors in the identification, selection, and acquisition of desirable leases. When attempting to purchase
interests in such properties, the Company competes with independent operators and major oil companies.
 
Foreign Taxes and United States Tax Credits
 
As a result of its Overriding Royalty Interests
attributable to properties outside the United States, the Company is subject to the imposition of taxes by foreign governments
upon the Company's income derived from such foreign jurisdictions. These taxes are of various types, with differing tax rates,
and are subject to change. Generally, the Company's income from a foreign jurisdiction will be taxed in the same manner as that
for other companies operating in the jurisdiction, but discriminatory taxation by a particular jurisdiction may occur. The current
non-resident corporate income tax rate in Australia, for Overriding Royalty Interests, is 30%.
 
As a Canadian corporation, the Company is liable
for income taxes under the laws of Canada. Under Canadian law the Company's Australian-source income is subject to a 46% tax (on
Canadian income). We believe the 30% Australian tax should be a credit toward the payment of the 46% Canadian tax under double
taxation treaties between the countries.
 
The Company is taxable in the U.S. on U.S. source
income. Because there has been neither U.S. source net income nor any income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business,
there have been no U.S. taxes incurred to date.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Oil and gas operations are subject to federal,
state and local laws and regulations governing waste, environmental quality, pollution control, conservation and other measures
regarding environmental and ecological matters. It is impossible to predict the impact of environmental legislation and regulations
on the Company's operations and earnings in the future.
 
The domestic production and sale of oil and
gas are subject to federal regulation by the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulation Commission. Rates of production
of oil and gas have for many years been subject to federal and state conservation laws and regulations. In addition, oil and gas
operations are subject to extensive federal and state regulations concerning exploration, development, production, transportation,
and pricing, and even to interruption or termination by governmental authorities.
 
In foreign countries, the Company may be subject
to governmental restrictions on production, pricing and export controls. Regulations existing or imposed upon the Company or its
properties at the time of their acquisition may change to an unpredictable extent. The Company will have little or no control over
the change of regulations or imposition of new regulations and restrictions, expropriation or nationalization by foreign governments
or the imposition of additional foreign taxes. Management believes that these actions are unlikely to be undertaken by the state
governments of South Australia, Queensland or Victoria, where all of the foreign oil and gas properties from which the Company
receives royalty income are currently located.
     
     
Foreign Currency
 
Due to the nature of the Company's activities
in Australia, portions of the Company's operating capital may at times be held in various foreign currencies. This subjects the
Company to the risk of currency fluctuations and changes in rates of conversion for different currencies. The Company does not
engage or expect to engage in any hedging or other transactions, which are intended to manage risks relating to foreign currency
fluctuations. Additionally, revenues generated in foreign countries in which the Company has or may acquire interests may be subject
to governmental regulations, which restrict the free convertibility of such funds, and all remittances of funds out of these countries
might require the approval of the applicable government's exchange control agency. Presently, the Company experiences no difficulties
with the free convertibility of funds from Australia. In the Company's opinion, the foreign exchange control laws currently in
effect in Australia, do not unreasonably delay the remittance of funds generated in Australia to the United States. The exchange
rate on April 3, 2012 was $1.00 Australian = $1.03745 United States dollar.
 
Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production
 
Our oil and natural gas exploration, production
and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local authorities and agencies.
Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural
gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable
to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.
 
Many states require permits for drilling operations,
drilling bonds and reports concerning operations, and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil
and natural gas. Such states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization
or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells, and the regulation of
spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations and properties will be subject
to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation,
storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health.
The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely
continue. These laws and regulations may: (i) require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or
drilling commences and for certain other activities; (ii) limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain
lands lying within wilderness and other protected areas; and (iii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from
our operations. The permits required for several of our operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing
authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions,
or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental law and regulations,
and we have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless,
changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on our business
operations, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.
 
Research and Development Activities 
 
Significant flooding that occurred in 2010 for
large parts of Australia continued to cause mobilization for 2011 work programs to be either cancelled or delayed for the majority
of the Company’s interests located within the Cooper-Eromanga Basin of Queensland and South Australia. The record flooding
also caused a number of our producing properties to be shut in due to lack of accessibility, which affected the Company’s
revenues.
     
     
The severe flooding in
2010 caused the Snatcher 1, 2 and 3 wells drilled during the last quarter of 2009 to be shut in during most of 2010 and all of
2011. Subsequent to the end of 2011 work was reported to be ongoing in the field to reclaim existing Snatcher wells. The operator
currently anticipates returning the field into production in April 2012. The Company holds an Overriding Royalty Interest in these
three wells. For additional information on the Snatcher wells see PEL 111 under “Item 2. Properties”.
 
Of particular interest
is the development of the Company’s 50% Working Interest in ATP 582. ATP 582 covers approximately 5,308,764 gross acres and
lies in the Georgina Basin, which is a part of the Cooper-Eromanga Basin. The improvement in multi high-pressure fracing technology
over the past 10 years has made low permeable shale more economic to produce both oil and gas and has been widely used in North
America to unlock unconventional reservoirs in shale bearing hydrocarbons. This technology has not been utilized in the Georgina
Basin; however on the adjoining concession to the east, in the Northern Territory, two horizontal wells (MacIntyre-2 and Baldwin-2H)
were drilled into the Arthur Creek Shale during the last quarter of 2011. Plans are to utilize the high pressure multiple stage
fracing on these two wells in the Arthur Creek Shale formation in the second half of 2012. ATP 582 is well positioned with approximately
1,000,000 acres on the northern most part known to have the presence of the Arthur Creek Shale in place. For additional information
see “Properties” ATP 582.
 
The Longtom gas project on VIC/P54 commenced
production in October 2009 under a sales agreement with Santos Ltd. VIC/P54 is located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin.
The Company holds a 1/20 th of 1% of the Gross Production in this concession, which has two successful wells (Longtom
#3 testing 23 million cubic feet of gas per day and the Longtom #4 testing 58 million cubic feet of gas per day). For additional
information see VIC/P54 in Item 2. Properties – Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin.
 
Personnel
 
The Company hires part time employees on an
as needed basis. The Company also engages consultants and professionals when needed for specific projects and/or tasks.
 
Definitions
 
The following definitions
are provided to clarify certain terms used in this report:
 
Authority to Prospect (“ATP”)
- a concession granted by the State of Queensland, Australia, which entitles its holders to an exclusive right to explore for
oil and natural gas in Queensland in the particular area covered by the ATP. Each ATP has an initial term of four years. The area
covered by an ATP is reduced by relinquishment of approximately one-fourth of the area at the start of the third year of its effectiveness
and an additional one-fourth of the original area at the start of the fourth year of its effectiveness. The area to be relinquished
is chosen by the holder of the ATP. An ATP will require some kind of geological and/or geophysical operations, such as new seismic
or seismic interpretation, drilling or other operations during the term of the tenure. The amount of work to be performed depends
upon the expenditures required for each specific year of the tenure. Holders are only required to expend those amounts as set out
in the original concession document. Applications for renewal may be filed at the time of expiration of an ATP.
 
Carried Working Interest – where
Working Interest is paid by a third party through the drilling phase or both the drilling and completion of a well. After the carried
portion of the well has been satisfied then the Carried Working Interest holder is responsible for its share of expenditures.
 
Developmental Wells - oil and gas wells
drilled within the proven area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
 
Dry Hole - a well found to be incapable
of producing oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
 
Exploration Permit – an exclusive
offshore exploration permit with a term of six years. Said permit is managed by the Victorian State Government.
     
     
Exploratory Well - a well drilled to
find and produce oil and gas in an unproved area or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil
or gas in another reservoir.
 
Gross Production - the total production
of oil, gas, or natural gas liquids from a property or group of properties for any specified period of time.
 
MCF - thousand cubic feet of natural
gas
 
MMCF - million cubic feet of natural
gas
 
Net Royalty Acre - generally, a measurement
of royalty or overriding royalty and the equivalent of the full customary one-eighth royalty of the gross production of revenue
free and clear of exploration, drilling and production costs from one acre of land. The number of net royalty acres used in this
report applies to figures as of December 31, 2011 and the number will change as relinquishments take place on the ATPs, as an ATP
expires or is canceled, or any new areas are added.
 
Overriding Royalty Interest (“ORRI”)
- an interest assigned out of the lessee’s leasehold or Working Interest. The amounts payable from Overriding Royalty
Interests are payments calculated as a percentage of either Gross Production or the gross revenues of the Working Interest (based
on the wellhead price) from a concession or lease, usually free and clear of all exploration, drilling and development and production
costs, except for any applicable taxes and federal levies. In calculating the wellhead price, pipeline and trucking costs have
already been deducted from the refinery price. The overriding royalties discussed herein are generally expressed as a percent of
the Gross Production.
 
Petroleum Exploration License (“PEL”)
- an exclusive oil and gas Exploration Permit issued by the South Australian Department of Primary Industries and Resources.
The initial term of the tenure is for a five (5) year period.
 
Petroleum Resource Rent Tax – a
tax on net income in Australia reduced by indexing on offshore production, which replaces the royalty and is a deduction from Australian
income tax.
 
Producing Wells - wells capable of producing
oil or gas in commercial quantities, including those wells capable of producing in commercial quantities that are shut in, or wells
that are not currently producing in commercial quantities but have been commercially productive in the past.
 
Royalty - generally, a share of the production
reserved by the grantor of an oil or gas lease or concession. The royalty interest is customarily free of cost or expense incident
to exploration, development or production, except for production or gathering taxes.
 
Spud Date or Spudded – The date
drilling operations begin.
 
Working Interest - all
or a fractional part of the ownership rights granted by a concession or lease. The owner of a Working Interest or a part thereof
pays all costs of exploration and is entitled to the Gross Production, less royalties retained by the grantor or lessor, and less
Overriding Royalty Interests or other non-operating interests created and assigned from the Working Interest. The owner of a Working Interest
may incur operating expenses in excess of income.
 
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
The Company’s principal
office space is located at 1301 Avenue M, Cisco, Texas 76437. The office space is for corporate identification, mailing, and courier
purposes and costs us approximately $3,200 in rent a year, which is paid to an affiliate. This $3,200 has been recorded as an expense
and contributed capital in the financials.
 
The Company holds
Overriding Royalty Interests in the Cooper-Eromanga Basins that cover parts of Queensland and South Australia. The Company’s
overriding royalties total 387,721 net royalty acres under 10,610,564 gross surface acres in 11 concessions located in the Cooper-Eromanga
Basins. In addition the Company also owns 623 net royalty acres under 155,676 gross acres in a concession located in the Bass Strait
of the Gippsland Basin located offshore of the state of Victoria, Australia. See Table of Overriding Royalty Interests for ownership
and acreage for each concession.
     
     
The Eromanga Basin
encompasses the southwestern portion of the state of Queensland and the northeast corner of South Australia, and is Australia’s
main onshore producing oil and gas basin.
 
The Cooper Basin is located in the northeast
part of the State of South Australia. Management believes the Company’s overrides are in a prime location since the majority
of the Company’s interests form nearly continuous blocks adjoining the producing block of Santos et al. which has reserves
in excess of one billion barrels of oil equivalent.
 
The Company has Overriding
Royalty Interests in VIC/P54 Permits in the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin is located between the states
of Victoria and Tasmania which have had in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since
exploration drilling began in 1964.
 
On the 10,766,240 gross surface
acres where ACOR holds Overriding Royalty Interests, there are large anticlines, large faults and hundreds of seismic structures,
all of which indicate possibilities for oil and gas reserves. In addition, about $27 million worth of seismic information has been
completed and is available on the areas.
 
During 2011 the Company received
revenues from six of its Overriding Royalty Interests known as ATP 267, ATP 299, ATP 560, PEL 111, PEL 115 and VIC/P54. For further
information see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation”.
 
In addition to the Company’s
large overriding royalty position it also has Working Interests in four concessions, which are all located in the Cooper/Eromanga
Basin. See the table for Working Interest Holdings for additional information.

(1) Our Company has entered into an agreement
where the partner will pay for the Native Title clearance, conduct a 2-D seismic program, drill one well, and earn 50% interest
in this concession.
 
The following is a summary of the Company’s
Australian properties divided into three areas: 1) Gippsland Basin - Victoria, 2) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of South Australia, and
3) Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland:
 
Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin
 
The Company holds Overriding
Royalty Interests in VIC/P54, a producing oil and gas concession, located in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin. The Bass Strait
of the Gippsland Basin is located between the State of Victoria and Tasmania which has in excess of 4 billion barrels of oil/condensate
and 12 TCF gas reserves discovered since exploration drilling began in 1964. The following is a report on the Company’s interests
in the Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin:
 
A review of the Longtom discoveries
is important to see the magnitude of these wells. The Longtom-3 was drilled and completed during the summer of 2006. Two production
tests were conducted on the well:
 
The first test produced gas from the
400 sand at 23MMscf/d. The results from this test confirm the flow potential of the 400 sand reservoir in the Longtom field, addressing
a major concern leading up to the drilling of the Longtom-3 well. A flow was not achieved in the second test of Longtom-2 (conducted
over the 400 sand). Nexus Energy Pty. Ltd. has interpreted this test as having failed due to down-hole mechanical problems.
 
The second test, over the 100, 200
and 300 sand intervals in the horizontal hole section exceeded expectations producing an estimated 77MMcf/d when bypassing the
test separator and 59MMcf/d when flowing through the test separator (the separator’s flow capacity). Sampling during the
test recorded expected levels of carbon dioxide (less than 1%) and less than one part per million hydrogen sulphide.
 
In addition, the second test indicated that
the condensate yield is higher in the 100 sands than in the sands above it, which is expected to provide an economic boost to the
project.
 
The Longtom-4 development well was drilled during
the summer of 2008. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in
both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.
 
A 12” pipeline was constructed to the
Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009. Revenues from gas sales for the Company began in 2010.
During 2010 the Longtom Field was shut in due to mercury levels exceeding gas plant standards. A processing plant was installed
to remove the excess mercury and production from the Longtom Field resumed in November 2010.
 
The Company’s net revenues
from the Longtom Field for 2011 were $44,129.51 representing approximately 35% of the total revenues reported for the year. The
operator of VIC/P54 is evaluating the Gemfish prospect for their next target as it is in a separate reservoir and structural setting.
No drilling dates have been announced as of the date of this report.
     
     
Cooper/Eromanga Basin - South Australia
 
The Company holds Overriding
Royalty Interests in five oil and gas concessions and holds Working Interests in three oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga
Basin of South Australia. The following is a brief summary report on each of the Company’s interests in South Australia:
 
PEL 88
 
ACOR owns a 3/10ths of 1% Overriding Royalty
Interest under PEL 88, which covers 816,436 gross acres. Three prospects have been identified on PEL 88, Acacia, Casuarina and
Lancier. The potential recoverable reserves of each of these prospects are 15,000,000 barrels of oil in the Acacia, 18,000,000
barrels of oil in the Casuarina and 48,000,000 barrels of oil in the Lancier. No assurance can be made that these prospects will
be drilled.
 
PEL 100
 
ACOR holds a 1% Working Interest in the Cleansweep
#1, which was drilled in the 2008 fiscal year and was completed as a Birkhead formation producer. The well tested 444 barrels of
oil on a drill stem test. The Cleansweep well is estimated to have the potential of 4.8 million barrels of recoverable oil in place.
Recent seismic mapping has confirmed that Angelica #1 drilled in 1998 was drilled off structure. A more detailed review of the
existing seismic identified a four-way drape structure of Eromanga Basin sediments over a basement horst bald of Permian strata.
A detailed 3D seismic program is planned to ensure that Angelica #2 tests the crest of this structure; however, this program has
been delayed due to flooding in the area. The Angelica 3D seismic survey is proposed to cover 302 square kilometers and was planned
for the fourth quarter of 2011, however it was delayed and as of the date of this report has not been rescheduled.
 
PEL 111
 
ACOR owns a 1/10th of 1% Overriding Royalty
Interest under PEL 111, which covers 290,101 gross acres. Mapping of PEL 111 seismic data coupled with the reprocessing of existing
seismic data identified 20 leads and prospects for potential oil and gas in the Birkhead, Hutton, Tirrawarra and Patchawarra formations.
The Warhawk #1 was drilled in 2008 and was cased and suspended as a future producer. During 2009 three wells (Snatcher 1, 2 &
3) were drilled and completed as producers in the Birkhead channel sands. The Snatcher #1 well tested 218 barrels of oil per day.
 
The Snatcher #1 began producing on December 20, 2009 with both the Snatcher wells 2 & 3 coming on line during the first quarter of 2010; however, they were shut in due to flooding and continued to remain shut in through 2011.  The severe flooding caused major road and access problems. The operator anticipates returning the field to production in April 2012.
 
Plans to drill Liberator #1 during the summer
of 2010, which is located approximately 700 meters northwest of Snatcher #3, has been delayed due to flooding in the area. As of
the date of this report no announcement has been made as to a drilling date for the Liberator #1.The operator reports another prospect
is on their 2012 plans for drilling, known as the Angelica #2.
 
Santos has commenced construction of the Charo-Tirrawarra
pipeline, which is to facilitate the transportation of crude oil from the Charo and Snatcher Fields. The pipeline is scheduled
for commissioning in April 2012.
 
PEL 112 & 444
 
Holloman Energy Corp. (“Holloman”), the
operator of PEL 112 & PEL 444, has identified 38 leads on PEL 112. The Company owns a 13.83% Working Interest under both PEL
112 & PEL 444 and is 100% fully carried for its 13.83% Working Interest in the next two wells drilled on either PEL. The Company
will be obligated to pay its proportionate part on any exploration costs thereafter. PEL 112 and PEL 444 comprise approximately
1.125 million gross acres and are both located within Australia’s most prolific onshore oil and gas-producing basin, the
Cooper/Eromanga Basin.
     
     
Subsequent to December 31, 2012 Holloman was
granted a variation on its license conditions on PEL 112. Under the terms of the variation, the date by which Holloman is obligated
to acquire 100 kilometers of 2D seismic on PEL was moved to January 10, 2013. Holloman also reports in their February 27, 2012
Press Release that it has recently received a series of offers relating to one or both of its Cooper Basin licenses. Holloman is
reviewing those proposals as of the date of this report. ACOR’s Carried Working Interest in both PEL 112 and 444 will be
adjusted in a joint effort with Holloman to attract a joint venture partner to conduct seismic and drill multiple wells.
 
During 2011, Beach Energy Limited discovered
three new oil pools on PEL 92, a license, which abuts the northwestern most corner, the PEL 112. One of those discoveries, the
Germein-1 oil discovery, is less than 7 miles from PEL 112. Although no formal reserve estimates or production data are yet available
on these discoveries, Beach Energy Limited reports that the PEL 92 Parsons-4 well, which tested at 7,600 barrels of oil per day,
is now online. ACOR does not own an interest in PEL 92, however the information on PEL 92 is important, as it is relevant to ACOR’s
Working Interest in PEL 112.
 
In October 2011, Senex Energy Limited (“Senex”)
initiated an eleven well drilling program on Petroleum Retention License ("PRL") 15 and PEL 104, both of which lie directly
southwest of PEL 444. PRL 15 contains the prolific Growler oil field, which is expected to produce approximately 700,000 barrels
of oil during Senex's current fiscal year. Senex reports completion of seven of the eleven wells. Five of the Senex wells were
successfully completed and suspended for future production. The Growler-6 well tested for production at 1,374 barrels of oil per
day. One of the two economically unsuccessful exploration wells (Spitfire-1) resulted in the discovery of a new oil field on PEL
104. ACOR does not own an interest in PEL 104 or PRL 15, however the information on PEL 104 is important, as it is relevant to
ACOR’s Working Interest in PEL 444.
 
PEL 115
 
This permit covers 65,730 gross acres under
which ACOR holds an Overriding Royalty Interest of 10% of 1% of Gross Production. PEL 115 is located in the prolific Cooper/Eromanga
Basin in South Australia. The Mirage-1 well completed in July 2005 initially flowed clean oil at a rate of 372 barrels of oil per
day on a ½ inch choke. Mirage-1 is currently producing on optimized beam pump operation at a rate of 140 barrels of oil
per day from the perforated 52-foot interval from 4330 feet to 4481 feet.
 
The interpreted recoverable oil reserve for
the Mirage Oil Field based on 2D seismic geophysical mapping is in a range from a mean of 1.3 million barrels up to a maximum of
3.6 million barrels. The interpretation of the 3D data set suggests that Mirage-1 could be part of a larger feature covering approximately
20 square kilometers that includes the Lightning and Jindivik prospects, 3.10 miles to the northeast. Such an area has the potential
of containing up to 23 million barrels of oil in place, subject to the presence of suitable Murta sand reservoir.
 
In the southern part of PEL 115 the interpretation
of the 3D Mirage and extensive 2D seismic data have defined four Jurassic and Permian oil and gas prospects (Voodoo, Fury, Airacobra
and Thunderbolt). During 2009 the Fury #1 and Airacobra #1 were drilled and completed as producers. Based on the analysis of the
wire line log data and sidewall cores and similarity of the Murta oil column in Fury-1 to those seen in the producing Mirage Oil
Field, 5 kilometers to the southwest, Fury-1 has been completed for production with 7 inch production casing run to 6,446 feet.
Production from Fury-1 was delayed due to flooding and damages incurred to the roads and area during 2011. As of the date of this
report no announcements have been received as to when production will begin.
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2012 a group announced
it had reached an agreement with Orca Energy Limited, operator of PEL 115, to farm-in to PEL 115. Under the terms of the agreement,
the group has the right to earn a further 22% in PEL 115 by committing to fund Orca’s remaining 20% share of the cost of
an unconventional gas well on the permit. Under this agreement the group’s ownership will increase to 55% working interest.
     
     
PEL 424
 
Formerly known as PEL’s 86, 87 & 89, these PEL’s
were grouped together for a new Petroleum Exploration License know as PEL 424 covering 1,516,733 acres under which the Company
holds a 10% of 1% of 8/8ths Overriding Royalty Interest represented by a total of 12,134 net royalty acres. The operator of
PEL 424 was Victoria Petroleum N.L. which became Senex Energy Limited during 2011. PEL 424 is located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin
in South Australia. As of the date of this report no information was available as to the plans for this area.
 
Cooper/Eromanga Basin – Queensland
 
The Company holds Overriding Royalty Interests in seven oil and gas
concessions and holds Working Interests in one oil and gas concession located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland. The following
is a report on each of the Company’s interests in Queensland:
 
ATP 267
 
The Company owns an Overriding Royalty Interest of 17.15% of 1% in
ATP 267, which covers approximately 220,800 acres. ATP 267 has 25 Producing Wells in six oil fields known as the Kihee, Koora,
Nockatunga, Winna, Maxwell, Dikera, Thungo and Murhero fields. The Company received revenues from its Overriding Royalty Interest
in these wells during 2011. No new wells were drilled during 2011 on this concession.
 
ATP 299
 
The Company owns a .0575% of 1% Overriding Royalty Interest under
ATP-299 and its Petroleum Licenses which covers 441,600 gross acres and currently has 104 completed wells under which ACOR receives
overriding royalties. The Tintaburra Block is reported to contain approximately 84 million barrels of proved plus probable oil
in place. ATP 299 has 104 Producing Wells in 25 oil fields. The Company received revenues of from its Overriding Royalty Interest
in these wells during 2011. No new wells were drilled during 2011 on this concession.
 
ATP 560
 
ATP 560 covers 625,600 acres under which the Company holds a 25%
of 1% override. The Utopia Oil Field is situated in ATP 560P in the Eromanga Basin in southwest Queensland, approximately 150 km
north east of the Jackson Oilfield and 50 km south of the Kenmore Oilfield. The Utopia field is a broad low-relief structure, with
a maximum relief of approximately 10 m. The field produces from the Early Cretaceous Murta Formation and is the largest known Murta
pool in the Queensland Eromanga Basin. The oil pool is at an approximate depth of 1020 m. The most recent technical review of Utopia
undertaken in June 2004 determined the field could contain up to 2.86 million barrels of recoverable oil.
 
During 2011 the Utopia-11H, a horizontal development
well, was drilled and completed as a Murta oil producer after a 176.5 meter horizontal drain hole was successfully drilled. The
operator reports excellent oil shows in a very good quality reservoir sand continued to be encountered while drilling the horizontal
leg. The Utopia-11H well was put into production during the third quarter of 2011.
 
ATP 582
 
ATP-582 is located in Queensland Australia in
the prolific Cooper/Eromanga Basin. The permit area covers approximately 5,308,764 gross acres. ATP 582 lies within the Georgina
Basin, which covers most of the central-eastern part of the Northern Territory and is considered one of the most prospective undeveloped
onshore petroleum provinces in Northern Territory and Queensland. Although the Georgina Basin has not had a discovery today, the
Company believes the Cambrian Thorntonia-Arthur Creek succession of the Georgina Basin possess all of the required elements necessary
for petroleum generation, migration and entrapment. Of particular interest in the Georgina Basin and on ATP 582 is the presence
of the Arthur Creek Shale, which has similar characteristics to the Bakken Shale of Western Canada and North Dakota that has produced
more than 10 TCF of gas and 1 Billion barrels of oil.
     
     
More improvement in multi
high-pressure fracing technology over the past 10 years has made low permeable shale very economic to produce both oil and gas
and has been widely used in North America to unlock unconventional reservoirs in shale bearing hydrocarbons. This technology has
not been utilized in the Georgina Basin; however, on the adjoining concession to the east in the Northern Territory plans are to
drill two horizontal wells into the Arthur Creek Shale utilizing the current high pressure multiple stage fracing on this formation.
ATP 582 is well positioned with a large portion of its 5,308,764 acres known to have the presence of the Arthur Creek Shale in
place.
 
On the adjoining concession
to the west of ATP 582 two horizontal wells drilled into the Arthur Creek Shale. The first well drilled was the Baldwin-2H well
followed by the MacIntyre-2H well located approximately 60 kilometers northeast of the Baldwin-2H well. PetroFrontier Corp. delayed
completion of these two wells due to the upcoming wet season and plans to complete both of these wells with a multiple staged frac
program. As of the date of this report no definitive plans have been announced as to the timing for the completion of these two
wells.
 
In addition to the Arthur
Shale opportunity, ACOR management has identified two prospects on ATP-582 from the 850 miles of seismic data, owned by ACOR. ATP
582 is up dip of the approximately $1 billion dollar annual production from the Santos-Exxon producing block and is along strike
with many new discovery wells that have sustained daily production of 1,000 - 3,000 barrels of oil per day. The two prospects that
have been identified are:
 
The Samphire Prospect covers approximately
3,800 acres and exhibits approximately 110 feet of closure. It is possible that a good potential exists for a 10-15 million barrel
field, with a possible potential of approximately 40 million barrels.
 
The Samphire West Prospect covers around
4,700 acres. If the Samphire prospect proves to be productive, a number of additional field discoveries may result from leads in
the Southern part of ATP-582. Both prospects are a series of sandstone (clastic) reservoirs of pinch-outs and structural traps
that have formed on the flank of the local high.
 
On September 26th, 2006 (subsequently
replaced by an agreement dated on or about February 23, 2012) the Company entered into an agreement where the partner will pay
to obtain Native Title clearance, pay all expenses in connection with applying for Environmental Authority, shoot a new seismic
grid survey over the leads identified by ACOR management from old seismic data to confirm good drillable targets with plans to
drill a well to earn a 50% Working Interest under ATP 582 (ACOR will be carried for 50% Working  Interest). During the fourth quarter of 2011
native title was cleared on ATP 582. A request was filed during the fourth quarter of 2011 to renew ATP 582 for a new exploration
term. As of the date of this report ATP 582 had not been renewed, however it is reported the renewal is expected to occur in April
2012.

General Discussion:
 
ACOR’s 2011 fiscal year
was another challenging year due to the return of flooding conditions covering most of the oil and gas concessions under which
the Company holds an interest. Because of the flooding only one well was drilled and completed as a producer during 2011 on the
Company’s properties in Australia.
 
ACOR began its movement from being primarily
an oil royalty company to an exploration company in 2000 when ACOR et al was awarded three large concessions in South Australia.
ACOR entered into a farm-out arrangement with Holloman to drill three wells retaining a 13.8325%
Carried Working Interest. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Holloman drilled the Pecos #1 well on PEL 112 being the first
of the three well programs. The Pecos #1 was completed as a Dry Hole. During 2008 Holloman obtained approval from the South Australian
Government for new exploration terms giving a new five-year work program for PEL 112 and consolidating PEL 108 & 109 to a new
Exploration Permit PEL 444. The Company’s terms and conditions mentioned above are subject to change on these two permits
as Holloman is seeking a joint venture partner to expand the work program. For further information on activities on the Company’s
properties see "Item 2. Properties".
 
A 12” pipeline was constructed to the
Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009 on VIC/P54. Revenues from gas sales for the Company
begin during the first half of 2010. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net
pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.
 
ACOR has Overriding Royalty Interests under
10,766,240 gross surface acres in the Cooper/Eromanga and Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin plus has working interests under 6,507,224
gross surface acres. For additional information regarding these concessions including those mentioned above in this section see
"Item 2. Properties".
     
     
The Company’s management
is optimistic about the future drilling planned on its Australian interests, especially for the next couple of years.
 
Results of Operations
 
The Company's oil and gas revenues increased
approximately 62% when comparing 2010 to 2011. In 2010 the revenues were $77,652 compared to $125,726 in 2011. The majority of
these revenues came from the Company’s ownership in ATP 299 and ATP 267, oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga
Basin of Queensland, Australia, and VIC/P54 located in the Bass Strait of Gippsland Basin of Victoria, Australia.
 
The categories of Personnel
Costs, Professional fees and Promotion and advertising reported expenditures of $144,840 for 2010 compared to $258,345 for 2011.
Of the $144,840 the Company paid $10,000 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2010 and of the $258,345 the Company
paid $179,778 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2011. The unregistered shares were issued for those services
based on the closing stock price at the time of issuance without any discount for their lack of liquidity. The basic allocation
of the 2010 Personnel Cost of $58,055 was $39,317 for contract services, $17,141 in wages and $1,600 for officer compensation.
The allocation of the 2011 Personnel Cost of $149,432 was $105,494 for contract services, $22,184 in wages, $21,600 for officer
compensation and $154 for miscellaneous fees. The Directors’ fees and other operating expense category for 2010 was $5,885
increasing to $52,506 for 2011. No Directors’ fees were awarded in 2010.
 
The other categories of expenditures
did not significantly change when comparing the fiscal year ended 2010 to 2011.
 
Other Income (Expense) for
the Company includes interest expense of $2,353 for 2010 compared to an interest expense of $5,149 for 2011.
 
Australian income taxes increased
from $10,026 in 2010 to $17,925 for 2011, which is directly related to the increase in revenues.
 
The net loss for the year ended December 31,
2010 was $147,311 compared to a net loss of $262,283 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Per share losses were $0.01 per share
for the year ended 2010 and $0.01 per share for 2011.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
The Company's Total Current Assets as of December
31, 2010 were $31,337 compared to $56,948 on December 31, 2011. The increase in current assets is due to the increase in cash on
hand. The Company’s receivables are due from oil and gas sales earned during the year but were not received on or before
the end of the reporting year.
 
The Total Current Liabilities as of December
31, 2010 were $217,211 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 0.14 to 1. The Total Current
Liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $343,564 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities
at 0.17 to 1. The slight improvement in liquidity ratio from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to more current assets as of December
31, 2011.
 
The Company plans to meet its operating expenditures
from a private placement of its restricted common stock. The Company is seeking exploration partners on its various oil and gas
concessions located in Australia.
 
Total assets of the Company
increased from $988,302 on December 31, 2010 to $1,227,350 on December 31, 2011, an increase of $239,048.  The Company Net
Property and Equipment increased from $955,881 in 2010 to $961,727.  This increase of $5,846 was attributed to the capital
expenditures made on ATP 582, an Australian oil and gas concession. The increase in assets is due to the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, Cooper/Eromanga Inc., placing an environmental bond for ATP 582 of $207,591 shown in the financial statements
as restricted cash under Other Assets.
     
     
Total Current Liabilities
of the Company increased from $217,211 on December 31, 2011 to $343,564 on December 31, 2011. This increase is
due to loans from shareholders of the Company for the environmental bond mentioned above for ATP 582.
 
The accrued expenses of $115,486
and $41,655 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 respectively were for consulting fees and director’s fees. The
$115,486 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2010 is allocated $2,903 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued
director’s fees and $76,983 for consulting fees. The $41,655 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2011 is allocated
$5,298 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued director’s fees and $757for other fees.
 
Plan of
Operation and Funding
 
The Company plans to seek
additional oil and gas concessions in Australia on a ground level basis and will seek partners to join in this process. The Company
has been successful in entering into farm-out arrangements to defer the exploration commitments on six Australian concessions to
joint venture partners and has confidence of being able to repeat this process in the event the Company is successful in acquiring
other concessions in Australia.
 
Material
Commitments
 
The Company has material financial commitments
on several of its working interest properties located in Australia. Concessions PEL 112, 444 and ATP 582 have expenditure requirements
that may exceed the Company’s Carried Working Interest in each of these concessions. See "Item 2. Properties" for additional
information.
 
Purchase
of Significant Equipment
 
The Company does not intend to purchase any significant equipment
during the next twelve months.
 
Subsequent Events:
 
The Company has acquired a 100% Working Interest
in PL 18 and PL 40, and a 50% Working Interest in PL 280, located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland Australia. This basin was
home to the first oil discovery in Australia, and is currently the focus of significant coal-seam gas exploration and production
activity by others.
 
The assets acquired by the
Company include 5 oilfields: Yellowbank Creek, Thomby Creek, Louise, McWhirter, Narrows and Beardmore. These fields were developed
in the 1970's and 1980's, and have collectively produced approximately 7-10% of the estimated oil originally in place ("OOIP").
The Company believes that up to 50% of the OOIP is potentially recoverable through the application of well-established enhanced
recovery techniques including downspacing, horizontal drilling, and reservoir pressure maintenance through waterflooding.
 
In 2007, the vendors of the Surat assets (the
"Vendors") obtained an independent resource report by CDS Data Services Pty Ltd. ("CDS Report") to assess the
remaining recoverable oil resources in the 5 fields. The CDS Report provided a range of 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to
6.7 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil resources. Since 2007, there has been no significant investment in the fields
as the Vendors were unsuccessful in securing the necessary capital to develop the remaining oil resources. The fields were recently
producing 4 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of high quality 51 degree oil, which is sold at a premium of approximately US$8.50 above
Brent crude oil price, or a premium of approximately US$24.00 above West Texas Intermediate crude oil price.
 
The Company currently has 50,000,000 shares
of common stock authorized and 49,960,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has agreed to hold an annual and special
meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable, in order to, among other things, amend the authorized share capital of the Company
to provide for an unlimited number of shares of common stock. Upon such amendments taking effect and in accordance with the terms
of the share exchange agreement dated November 17, 2011 (the "Share Exchange Agreement") among ACOR, 1629518 Alberta
Ltd. and certain other parties thereto, the Company will issue an additional 69,065 shares of the Company to Bill Petrie Sr, Bill
Petrie, Jr, and Jesse Meidl, along with the issuance of 5,000,000 Share Purchase Warrants of ACOR (the "Warrants") to
certain persons in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The Warrants will have a strike price of US$0.25 per share, and
will only vest if the Company trades at a price above US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days, with a total of 100,000 Company
shares trading during the 10 day period, and expire 24 months after the date of issuance.
     
     
The Company has agreed to pay the Vendors US$3.0
million within 12 months of the closing of the Acquisition (the "Deferred Consideration"). The Vendors have secured a
first lien over PL 18, PL 40, and PL 280. The Company intends to secure a reserve based lending facility to refinance the Deferred
Consideration, which does not accrue interest or other charges within 12 months of closing.
 
The Board of the Company are pleased to add
two experienced oil industry executives: William Petrie Sr. and Jesse Meidl.
 
Mr. Petrie has in excess of 35 years' experience
as a petroleum geologist, primarily in Western Canada. He began his career with Mobil Oil, leaving after several years to join
the independent sector. He has been involved as President and Director for a number of public and private oil and gas companies.
In these positions he was responsible for generating, evaluating, and successfully exploiting oil and gas exploration, development,
and acquisition opportunities throughout North America.
 
Mr. Meidl has over 15 years of experience in
the oil and gas sector. He is Chief Financial Officer of a private international energy company, headquartered in London, England.
Prior thereto, he was an investment banker in the International Oil & Gas group of Thomas Weisel Partners in London (Now Stifel
Nicolas). Mr. Meidl was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Arsenal Energy Inc., an international exploration company listed
on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which held production assets in Canada and the USA and exploration assets in Egypt, Colombia and
Uzbekistan. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG in Calgary, where he specialized in oil and gas exploration and production
and services. He also holds the ICAEW Corporate Finance qualification and a B. Comm. degree from the University of Saskatchewan
(Canada).
 
It is planned that during the second quarter
of 2012, the Company will be undertaking a workover program of certain wells on PL 40 and PL 280 which will reactivate two old
wells at a cost of A$400,000. The workover program is anticipated to bring total field production to approximately 25 barrels of
oil per day.
 
The Company will also be obtaining an updated
reserve and resource report over all of the assets in the Company's portfolio, including the Surat basin assets and ATP 582. It
is anticipated the report will be finalized in the second quarter of 2012.
 
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements
 
The FASB established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements
issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The codification has changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP
guidance is referenced, but did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” This ASU requires some new disclosures and
clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 820. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the
amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for
the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting
entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies
the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company will comply with the additional disclosures required
by this guidance upon its adoption in January 2010.
     
     
Also in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-03, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas—Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.”  This
ASU amends the “Extractive Industries—Oil and Gas” Topic of the Codification to align the oil and gas reserve
estimation and disclosure requirements in this Topic with the SEC’s Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and
Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” discussed below.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
ending on or after December 31, 2009, and the adoption of these provisions on December 31, 2009 did not have a material impact
on our financial statements.
 
SEC’s Final Rule on Oil and Gas Disclosure
Requirements 
 
On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Release
No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” which revises the disclosures required
by oil and gas companies.  The SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas companies have been updated to include expanded
disclosure for oil and gas activities, and certain definitions have also been changed that will impact the determination of oil
and gas reserve quantities.  The provisions of this final rule are effective for registration statements filed on or
after January 1, 2010, and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009
 
In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05,
“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” related to
fair value measurement of liabilities. This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active
market for an identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more valuation
techniques. This guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance.
 
In June 2009,
the FASB issued guidance under ASC 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This guidance established a new
hierarchy of GAAP sources for non-governmental entities under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Codification is the
sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, except for those issued
by the SEC. The guidance was effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009.
The adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations .
 
In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance under
ASC 855 “Subsequent Events,” which sets forth: (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which management
of reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial
statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet
date in its financial statements and (3) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred
after the balance sheet date. The guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or annual financial periods ending
after June 15, 2009.
 
In April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance
under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” related to estimating fair value when the volume and level
of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is
not orderly. The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption
permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s
results of operations.
 
Also in April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance
under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim
reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance also requires those disclosures
in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending
after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
     
     
The FASB updated its
guidance under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in April 2009, which addresses application issues on initial recognition
and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in
a business combination. This guidance was effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first
annual period on or after December 15, 2008.
 
In June 2008, the FASB
updated its guidance under ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” This guidance clarified that all unvested share-based payment
awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities and provides guidance on how to allocate earnings
to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share using the two-class method. This guidance was effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have
a material impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations.
 
In
March 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which changes the disclosure requirements
for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why
an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative
instruments and related items affect an entity’s financial position, operations and cash flows. This guidance was effective
as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance
on January 1, 2009 .
 
Accounting For Natural Gas and Oil Producing
Activities
 
We use the full cost method to account for our
natural gas and oil producing activities. Under this accounting method, we capitalize substantially all of the costs incurred in
connection with the acquisition, development, and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves in full cost pools maintained by
geographic areas, regardless of whether reserves are actually discovered and apply a quarterly full cost ceiling test. Adverse
changes in conditions (primarily gas price declines) could result in permanent write-downs in the carrying value of oil and gas
properties as well as non-cash charges to operations, but would not affect cash flows.
 
Property, Equipment and Depreciation
 
We follow the full cost method of accounting
for our oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the acquisition of methane, petroleum, and natural gas interests are
capitalized. Under this method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development
of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs, annual carrying charges of non-producing
properties, geological and geophysical costs, costs of drilling and equipping productive and non-productive wells, and direct exploration
salaries and related benefits. Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas properties are recorded as a reduction of the related
capitalized costs without recognition of a gain or loss unless the disposal would result in a change of 20 percent or more in the
depletion rate.
 
Depreciation and depletion of proved oil and
gas properties is computed on the units-of-production method based upon estimates of proved reserves, as determined by independent
consultants, with oil and gas being converted to a common unit of measure based on their relative energy content.
 
The
costs of acquisition and exploration of unproved oil and gas properties, including any related capitalized interest expense, are
not subject to depletion, but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis. The costs of certain unevaluated
leasehold acreage are also not subject to depletion. Costs not subject to depletion are periodically assessed for possible impairment
or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs subject to depletion are increased or a charge is made against
earnings for those operations where a reserve base is not yet established .
 
Estimated future removal and site restoration
costs are provided over the life of proven reserves on units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal
and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred,
and technology and industry standards. The charge is included in the provision for depletion and depreciation and the actual restoration
expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred.
     
     
We apply a ceiling test to capitalized costs which limits such costs
to the aggregate of the estimated present value, using a ten percent discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from production
of proven reserves at year end at market prices less future production, administrative, financing, site restoration, and income
tax costs plus the lower of cost or estimated market value of unproved properties. If capitalized costs are determined to exceed
estimated future net revenues, a write-down of carrying value is charged to depletion in the period.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
In connection with the preparation of this Form
10-K, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act")) as of December 31, 2011. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures.
 
Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms.
 
Management's Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting
 
Management of our company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Principal Accounting Officer, designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP accounting principles. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
     
     
 
    •
    Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;
    •
    Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and
    •
    Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Our management conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established
in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
on this assessment, our management concluded that there was no material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting,
and accordingly, our controls are effective.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
This Form 10-K does not include
an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary
rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this Form 10-K.
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There were no changes in internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, that materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

of the Company provided office space and services, with no cash costs to the Company. These contributed costs had estimated unpaid

Kamon. Additionally, the Company repaid Australian Grazing & Pastoral Co., Pty. Ltd., also controlled by Robert Kamon, for
filing fees during 2010, which totaled $23,275.
 
The Company borrowed $218,500 from two of its
stockholders (Ken Kamon and Ely Sakhai) in 2011. The terms of the loan are 5% interest per annum if paid by February 12, 2012 and
if paid after February 12, 2012 the interest rate shall be 12% per annum or the maximum rate allowed by law. During 2010, the Company
borrowed $25,000 from Ely Sakahi, a stockholder of the Company and $25,655 from Ken Kamon, a stockholder of the Company (this $25,655
plus $3,365 in interest was repaid during 2011). These funds were used to pay for administrative costs and efforts to promote the
Company's name and availability.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s
accounts payable was $5,617 and $11,243, respectively. Accounts payable to related parties was $52,794 and $39,216 in 2011 and

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
Board of Directors
Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd.
Cisco, Texas
 
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
of Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. as of December
31, 2011, and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements, the Company
has suffered recurring losses from operations and its limited capital resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also discussed in Note 11. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2011 and 2010
 
NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. (the
Company) was incorporated April 28, 1997 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its primary business plan is the purchase of Overriding
Royalty Interests for long-term passive income and capital gains, with sales of these interests as deemed in the best interest
of the Company. Current primary income sources are royalties earned on Overriding Royalty Interests held by the Company. The Company
also engages related entities and third parties for leasing operations in Australia. The primary producing properties held by the
Company are located in Australia’s main onshore oil and gas producing basin. These financial statements are prepared in U.S.
dollars for use in U.S. securities filings.
 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Stock Based Compensation
 
The Company accounts for services acquired (and
other expenses paid) using stock as compensation (or payment) based on the fair value of the shares issued. Fair value is determined
based on the closing price of the stock on the date the Company becomes obligated to issue the shares.
 
Oil and Gas Properties
 
The Company follows the full cost method of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities and, accordingly, capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration,
and development of proved oil and gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, Dry Holes, geophysical costs, and
annual rentals. All general corporate costs are treated as expenses as incurred. In general, sale or other dispositions of oil
and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded. Capitalized costs are recorded
in cost centers on a country-by-country basis. Most of the Company’s oil and gas properties consist of Overriding Royalty
Interests that are located in Australia. The Company had not participated in the exploration and development of proved oil and
gas properties until 2002. Capitalized costs are subject to a “ceiling test,” which basically limits such costs to
the aggregate of the “estimated present value,” discounted at a 10% interest rate of future net revenues from proved
reserves, based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties.
Costs in excess of the ceiling test are adjusted against income.
 
Costs of producing royalty interests are being
amortized over the estimated reserves reported by the Queensland, Australia government (for Queensland properties) and the operator
of the Victoria, Australia petroleum lease (Victoria property). Costs of non-producing interests are not being amortized pending
development or production and sale of oil or gas, but they are assessed for impairment on an aggregate country-by-country basis.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
December 31, 2011 and 2010
 
Office Equipment and Software
 
Office equipment and software are carried at
depreciated cost. Acquisitions are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives
are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of software and equipment
is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related asset. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes.
 
Income Taxes
 
Deferred tax liabilities and assets result from
temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. The company records and adjusts
any deferred tax asset valuations based on judgment as to future realization of the deferred tax benefits supported by demonstrated
trends in the Company’s operating results.
 
As a Canadian corporation, the Company is liable
for income taxes under the laws of Canada. Under Canadian laws the Company’s Canadian-source income is subject to a 46% tax
(denominated in Canadian dollars). Operating losses can be carried forward for seven years. The Company has unused operating loss
carry-forwards at December 31, 2011 that may be applied against future Canadian taxable income. These expire as presented below.
Because the timing of realization of the tax benefit from these loss carry-forwards cannot be currently projected, a valuation
allowance has been established to completely offset this asset.

    Loss Carryforward

    2018
     
     
     
    $2,537,994
     
     
 
The potential tax benefit from these operating
loss carry-forwards is $1,167,477 and $1,119,613 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance
against these deferred tax assets due to the inability to foresee when such benefits will be realized.
 
The Company is subject to a 30% Australian income
tax on Australian source royalty income. This tax is withheld by the payer. The Company incurred Australian income taxes on its
oil and gas production totaling $17,168 and $10,026 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Loss Per Share
 
U.S. accounting
rules provide for the calculation of “Basic” and “Diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per common
share are computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per common share
reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the loss of the entity on as “as if converted” basis.
This is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted if necessary, by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive securities.
 
Weighted average shares outstanding were 21,096,182
and 19,772,491 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Outstanding common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of
diluted losses per share because their effect would be antidilutive.
 
Cash Flows
 
The Company considers unrestricted cash and
cash investments with initial maturity or marketability of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of presenting
its Statement of Cash Flows. Cash investments whose use is limited through collateral restrictions are not considered to be cash
for cash flows.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
 
Financial Instruments
 
Unless otherwise specified, management believes
the carrying value of its financial instruments approximates their fair value due to the short term to maturity.
 
Reclassifications
 
Certain 2010 amounts have been reclassified
in order to conform to the 2011 financial statement presentation.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
The FASB established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements
issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The codification has changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP
guidance is referenced, but did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
December 31, 2011 and 2010
 
In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This update provides the option to present the total of
comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous
statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company does not believe that this will materially
impact the presentation of its financial statements.
 
 In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS .
This update does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect
valuation practices outside of financial reporting. This update may require certain additional disclosures related to fair value
measurements. We do not expect the adoption of this update will materially impact our financial statement disclosures.
 
In December 2010, the FASB (Financial Accounting
Standards Board) issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-29 (ASU 2010-29), Business Combinations (Topic 805) – Disclosure
of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations . This Accounting Standards Update requires a public entity
to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period. The disclosures include
pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business
combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. The amendments in this
Update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company does
not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-29 to have a material effect on our financial statements.
 
In   July 2010, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2010-20 (ASU 2010-20), Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables
and the Allowance for Credit Losses.   The amendments in this Update are to provide financial statement users with greater
transparency about an entity’s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. The disclosures
about activity that occurs during the reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after
December 15, 2010.  The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-20 to have a material effect on our financial
statements.
 
In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09
Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855) - Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2010-09).  ASU
No. 2010-09 requires an entity that is an SEC filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements
are issued and removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through
which the filer had evaluated subsequent events. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” This ASU requires some new disclosures and
clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 820. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the
amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for
the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting
entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies
the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3
fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The adoption did not have an impact on our financial statement.
 
Also in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-03, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas—Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.”  This
ASU amends the “Extractive Industries—Oil and Gas” Topic of the Codification to align the oil and gas reserve
estimation and disclosure requirements in this Topic with the SEC’s Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and
Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” discussed below.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
ending on or after December 31, 2009, and the adoption of these provisions on December 31, 2009 did not have a material impact
on our financial statements.
 
NOTE 2: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company has
accrued receivables for oil and gas production from its Australian Overriding Royalty Interests totaling $26,770 and $28,992, respectively.
Collection of the accrued Australian production generally occurs during the quarter following the quarter of production.
 
The cost basis of the receivables are believed
to approximate their fair values. No allowance for bad debts has been established because the Company has not experienced any significant
inability to collect its receivables.

NOTE 6: FOREIGN OPERATIONS
 
As noted above, the Company was incorporated
in Canada. Additionally, the Company operates primarily in Australia where most of its properties are presently located. Approximately
95% of all operating revenues reported by the Company during 2011 and 2010 were received from Australian oil and gas royalty interests.
Depletion expense and Australian income taxes reported by the Company during 2011 and 2010 are also related to the revenue received
from the Australian royalties. Australian revenues were $125,262 and $76,830 in 2011 and 2010.
 
Essentially all of the Company’s administrative
costs are incurred in the United States. Leasing operating expenses and taxes have been incurred in the U.S. and taxes have been

NOTE 8: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
We have evaluated events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2011 through the date the financial statements were ready for issuance as noted below:
 
The Company acquired a 100% Working Interest
in PL 18, PL 40, and a 50% Working Interest in PL 280, located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland Australia. This basin was
home to the first oil discovery in Australia, and is currently the focus of significant coal-seam gas exploration and production
activity by others. In connection  with the transaction, the Company sold 5,473,385 shares for cash and issued  21,780,935 shares to the sellers.
 
The assets acquired by the
Company include 5 oilfields: Yellowbank Creek, Thomby Creek, Louise, McWhirter, Narrows and Beardmore. These fields were developed
in the 1970's and 1980's, and have collectively produced approximately 7-10% of the estimated oil originally in place ("OOIP").
The Company believes that up to 50% of the OOIP is potentially recoverable through the application of well-established enhanced
recovery techniques including downspacing, horizontal drilling, and reservoir pressure maintenance through waterflooding.
 
In 2007, the vendors of the Surat assets (the
"Vendors") obtained an independent resource report by CDS Data Services Pty Ltd. ("CDS Report") to assess the
remaining recoverable oil resources in the 5 fields. The CDS Report provided a range of 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to
6.7 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil resources. Since 2007, there has been no significant investment in the fields
as the Vendors were unsuccessful in securing the necessary capital to develop the remaining oil resources. The fields were recently
producing 4 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of high quality 51 degree oil, which is sold at a premium of approximately US$8.50 above
Brent crude oil price, or a premium of approximately US$24.00 above West Texas Intermediate crude oil price.
 
After the  acquisition, the Company currently has 50,000,000 shares
of common stock authorized and 49,960,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has agreed to hold an annual and special
meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable, in order to, among other things, amend the authorized share capital of the Company
to provide for an unlimited number of shares of common stock. Upon such amendments taking effect and in accordance with the terms
of the share exchange agreement dated November 17, 2011 (the "Share Exchange Agreement") among ACOR, 1629518 Alberta
Ltd. and certain other parties thereto, the Company will issue an additional 69,065 shares of the Company to Bill Petrie Sr, Bill
Petrie Jr, and Jesse Meidl, along with the issuance of 5,000,000 Share Purchase Warrants of ACOR (the "Warrants") to
certain persons in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The Warrants will have a strike price of US$0.25 per share, and
will only vest if the Company trades at a price above US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days, with a total of 100,000 Company
shares trading during the 10 day period, and expire 24 months after the date of issuance.
 
The Company has agreed to pay the Vendors US$3.0
million within 12 months of the closing of the Acquisition (the "Deferred Consideration"). The Vendors have secured a
first lien over PL 18, PL 40, and PL 280. The Company intends to secure a reserve based lending facility to refinance the Deferred
Consideration, which does not accrue interest or other charges within 12 months of closing.

Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties, Ltd.
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
December 31, 2011 and 2010
 
The Board of the Company are pleased to add
two experienced oil industry executives: William Petrie Sr. and Jesse Meidl.
 
Mr. Petrie has in excess of 35 years' experience
as a petroleum geologist, primarily in Western Canada. He began his career with Mobil Oil, leaving after several years to join
the independent sector. He has been involved as President and Director for a number of public and private oil and gas companies.
In these positions he was responsible for generating, evaluating, and successfully exploiting oil and gas exploration, development,
and acquisition opportunities throughout North America.
 
Mr. Meidl has over 15 years of experience in
the oil and gas sector. He is Chief Financial Officer of a private international energy company, headquartered in London, England.
Prior thereto, he was an investment banker in the International Oil & Gas group of Thomas Weisel Partners in London (Now Stifel
Nicolas). Mr. Meidl was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Arsenal Energy Inc., an international exploration company listed
on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which held production assets in Canada and the USA and exploration assets in Egypt, Colombia and
Uzbekistan. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG in Calgary, where he specialized in oil and gas exploration and production
and services. He also holds the ICAEW Corporate Finance qualification and a B. Comm. degree from the University of Saskatchewan
(Canada).
 
It is planned that during the second quarter
of 2012, the Company will be undertaking a workover program of certain wells on PL 40 and PL 280 which will reactivate two old
wells at a cost of A$400,000. The workover program is anticipated to bring total field production to approximately 25 barrels of
oil per day.
 
The Company will also be obtaining an updated
reserve and resource report over all of the assets in the Company's portfolio, including the Surat basin assets and ATP 582. It
is anticipated the report will be finalized in the second quarter of 2012.
 
NOTE 9: CONCENTRATION OF RISK
 
The producing oil and gas assets of the Company
are all located in Australia. These continue to be the primary source of operating revenues for the Company.
 
Accounts at the bank are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per depositor. Combined balances at December 31, 2011 at the Company’s
primary bank did not exceed federally insured limits. At December 31, 2011, $209,153 was held in an Australian bank. At December
31, 2011, $207,591 in the Australian bank is restricted to comply with environmental bond requirements of the Queensland, Australia
government and accordingly is classified as Other Assets on the Balance Sheet.
 
NOTE 10: GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS
 
As of December 31, 2011, the Company has limited
disposable cash and its revenues are not sufficient to, and cannot be projected to, cover operating expenses and expansion by the
Company. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Management’s
plans include attempting to raise funds from the public through a stock offering, and attempting to acquire additional producing
interests in exchange for stock. Management intends to make every effort to identify and develop sources of funds. There is no
assurance that Management will be successful. The Company is effectively debt free and could continue to operate at subsistence
levels pending development of funding sources.

OF OIL AND GAS (UNAUDITED)
 
The following schedules set out available information
about the Company’s oil and gas activities at December 31, 2011.
 
Reserves of Oil and Gas - Royalty Interests
 
The current quantities of reserves of oil and
gas relating to royalty interests are presented based on information obtained from estimated reserves as reported by the Queensland,
Australia Government and the operator of the Victoria, Australia petroleum lease. Reserve data for Victoria lease was derived from
reserve data reported by the operator at October 1, 2009, adjusted for actual production in 2010 and 2011. Reserve data is revised
annually and published by the Queensland government on their website. No reserve information is presented relating to the Company’s
Working Interests because the necessary information is not available or the Company’s interests are not large enough to economically
and reasonably obtained this information.

Ltd. (the “ Company ” or “ ACOR ”) and Jessie Meidl and William Petrie, Sr., (collectively, the
“ Stockholders ” and each a “ Stockholder ”).
RECITALS:
WHEREAS, the Company
has entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (“ SEA ”) dated November 17, 2011 with 1629518 Alberta Ltd. and its
shareholders, including the Stockholders, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A (such purchase the “ ACOR

WHEREAS, the Stockholders
wish to agree, among each other, to abstain from voting, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a portion

NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing premises and certain other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Stockholders agree as follows:
1.
Agreement to Vote . The Stockholders, collectively as holders
of Common Shares of the Company, hereby agree on behalf of themselves, any entity they control which holds such Common Shares (“ Entities ”)
and any transferee or assignee of any such shares of Common Shares (“ Transferees ”), to hold all of the shares
of Common Shares registered in their names or in the name of an Entity or Transferee (and any securities of the Company issued
with respect to, upon conversion of, or in exchange or substitution of the Common Shares, and any other voting securities of the
Company subsequently acquired by such Stockholder, Entity or Transferee) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “ Shares ”)
and abstain from voting the Shares at a regular or special meeting of the stockholders (or by written consent), an aggregate of
7,471,400 Shares. 
2.
Sale of the Company . Provided that the ACOR Purchase is on
substantially the terms set forth on Exhibit A hereto, each party hereto hereby agrees to comply with the following provisions
with respect to all Common Shares which they own or otherwise exercise voting or dispositive authority:
3.
Specific Enforcement . It is agreed and understood that monetary
damages would not adequately compensate the Company for the breach of this Agreement by any Stockholder, that this Agreement shall
be specifically enforceable, and that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary
or permanent injunction or restraining order. Further, each Stockholder hereto waives any claim or defense that there is an adequate
remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach.
4.
Notices . All notices and other communications given or made
pursuant hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed effectively given: (i) upon personal delivery to the party to be notified;
(ii) when sent by confirmed electronic mail or facsimile if sent during normal business hours of the recipient; if not, then on

verification of receipt. All communications shall be sent to the respective parties at the addresses set forth on the signature
pages attached hereto (or at such other addresses as shall be specified by notice given in accordance with this Section 5).
5.
Term . This Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect upon the occurrence of the earlier of (i) a Liquidity Event of the Company; or (ii) the date that is 36 months from the
date hereof. “ Liquidity Event ” shall mean the occurrence of any one or more of the following events or circumstances:
(a) the Common Shares being listed on any of the Toronto Stock Exchange, TSX Venture Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Nasdaq Stock Market or any other recognized stock exchange, and not being subject to any restricted period or hold period under
applicable securities laws in Canada (other than in respect of resales by a control person); (b) all of the issued and outstanding
Common Shares (other than Common Shares in respect of which dissent, appraisal or similar rights have been exercised) having been
sold for cash pursuant to a take-over bid, arrangement, amalgamation or other transaction; (c) all of the issued and outstanding
Common Shares (other than Common Shares in respect of which dissent, appraisal or similar rights have been exercised) having been

Canada (other than in respect of resales by a control person); or (d) any combination of the events or circumstances described
in the preceding clauses (a) through (iii) such that at least one of such events or circumstances applies with respect to all of
the Common Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholders shall be entitled to exercise their voting rights in connection
with any transaction that would constitute a Liquidity Event. 
6.
Amendments and Waivers . Any term hereby may be amended and
the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively)
only with the written consent of each of the Stockholders party hereto.
7.
Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, etc . In the event of any issuance
of shares of the Company’s voting securities hereafter to any of the Stockholders (including, without limitation, in connection
with any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, or the like), such shares shall become subject to this
Agreement.
8.
Severability . Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall
be held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition
or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
9.
Binding Effect . In addition to any restriction or transfer
that may be imposed by any other agreement by which any Stockholder may be bound, this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties,
their respective heirs, successors, transferees and assigns. 
10.
Governing Law . This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard
to conflicts of law principles thereof.
11.
Entire Agreement . This Agreement is intended to be the sole
agreement of the Stockholders as it relates to this subject matter and does hereby supersede all other agreements of the Stockholders
relating to the subject matter hereof.
12.
Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

(the Company) was incorporated April 28, 1997 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its primary business plan is the purchase of Overriding Royalty Interests for long-term passive income and capital gains, with sales of these interests as deemed in the best interest of the Company. Current primary income sources are royalties earned on Overriding Royalty Interests held by the Company. The Company also engages related entities and third parties for leasing operations in Australia. The primary producing properties held by the Company are located in Australia&#146;s main onshore oil and gas producing basin. These financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars for use in U.S. securities filings.</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify">SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify"><u>Stock Based Compensation</u></p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify">The Company accounts for services acquired (and other expenses paid) using stock as compensation (or payment) based on the fair value of the shares issued.

All general corporate costs are treated as expenses as incurred. In general, sale or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded. Capitalized costs are recorded in cost centers on a country-by-country basis. Most of the Company&#146;s oil and gas properties consist of Overriding Royalty Interests that are located in Australia. The Company had not participated in the exploration and development of proved oil and gas properties until 2002. Capitalized costs are subject to a &#147;ceiling test,&#148; which basically limits such costs to the aggregate of the &#147;estimated present value,&#148; discounted at a 10% interest rate of future net revenues from proved reserves, based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. Costs in excess of the ceiling test are adjusted against income.</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify">Costs of producing royalty interests are being amortized over the estimated reserves reported by the Queensland, Australia government (for Queensland properties) and the operator of the Victoria, Australia petroleum lease (Victoria property). Costs of non-producing interests are not being amortized pending development or production and sale of oil or gas, but they are assessed for impairment on an aggregate country-by-country basis.</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify"><u>Office Equipment and Software</u></p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify">Office equipment and software are carried at depreciated cost. Acquisitions are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of software and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related asset. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify"><u>Income Taxes</u></p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif">&nbsp;</p> <p style="MARGIN:0px; FONT:10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; TEXT-ALIGN:justify">Deferred tax liabilities and assets result from temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.

        Loans, Notes, Trade and Other Receivables Disclosure [Text Block]
        NOTE 2: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE   At December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company has accrued receivables for oil and gas production from its Australian Overriding Royalty Interests totaling $26,770 and $28,992, respectively. Collection of the accrued Australian production generally occurs during the quarter following the quarter of production.   The cost basis of the receivables are believed to approximate their fair values. No allowance for bad debts has been established because the Company has not experienced any significant inability to collect its receivables.

            - Definition
                Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

                Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent.

This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

            - Definition
                Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

            - Definition
                The net cash from (used in) all of the entity's operating activities, including those of discontinued operations, of the reporting entity. Operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and providing services. Operating activity cash flows include transactions, adjustments, and changes in value that are not defined as investing or financing activities. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a debit balance consistent with its label.

        Business Description and Accounting Policies [Text Block]
        NOTE 1: DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. (the Company) was incorporated April 28, 1997 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Its primary business plan is the purchase of Overriding Royalty Interests for long-term passive income and capital gains, with sales of these interests as deemed in the best interest of the Company. Current primary income sources are royalties earned on Overriding Royalty Interests held by the Company. The Company also engages related entities and third parties for leasing operations in Australia. The primary producing properties held by the Company are located in Australias main onshore oil and gas producing basin. These financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars for use in U.S. securities filings.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Stock Based Compensation   The Company accounts for services acquired (and other expenses paid) using stock as compensation (or payment) based on the fair value of the shares issued. Fair value is determined based on the closing price of the stock on the date the Company becomes obligated to issue the shares.   Oil and Gas Properties   The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities and, accordingly, capitalizes all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, Dry Holes, geophysical costs, and annual rentals. All general corporate costs are treated as expenses as incurred. In general, sale or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recorded. Capitalized costs are recorded in cost centers on a country-by-country basis. Most of the Companys oil and gas properties consist of Overriding Royalty Interests that are located in Australia. The Company had not participated in the exploration and development of proved oil and gas properties until 2002. Capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test, which basically limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value, discounted at a 10% interest rate of future net revenues from proved reserves, based on current economic and operating conditions, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. Costs in excess of the ceiling test are adjusted against income.   Costs of producing royalty interests are being amortized over the estimated reserves reported by the Queensland, Australia government (for Queensland properties) and the operator of the Victoria, Australia petroleum lease (Victoria property). Costs of non-producing interests are not being amortized pending development or production and sale of oil or gas, but they are assessed for impairment on an aggregate country-by-country basis.   Office Equipment and Software   Office equipment and software are carried at depreciated cost. Acquisitions are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. The cost of software and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related asset. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.   Income Taxes   Deferred tax liabilities and assets result from temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. The company records and adjusts any deferred tax asset valuations based on judgment as to future realization of the deferred tax benefits supported by demonstrated trends in the Companys operating results.   As a Canadian corporation, the Company is liable for income taxes under the laws of Canada. Under Canadian laws the Companys Canadian-source income is subject to a 46% tax (denominated in Canadian dollars). Operating losses can be carried forward for seven years. The Company has unused operating loss carry-forwards at December 31, 2011 that may be applied against future Canadian taxable income. These expire as presented below. Because the timing of realization of the tax benefit from these loss carry-forwards cannot be currently projected, a valuation allowance has been established to completely offset this asset.     Amount of Unused Operating   Expiring During Year Ended  Loss Carryforward   December 31,         $  614,872   2012     620,354   2013     329,446   2014     326,778   2015     236,950   2016     147,311   2017     262,283   2018         $2,537,994       The potential tax benefit from these operating loss carry-forwards is $1,167,477 and $1,119,613 in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company has recognized a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets due to the inability to foresee when such benefits will be realized.   The Company is subject to a 30% Australian income tax on Australian source royalty income. This tax is withheld by the payer. The Company incurred Australian income taxes on its oil and gas production totaling $17,168 and $10,026 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.   Loss Per Share   U.S. accounting rules provide for the calculation of Basic and Diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the loss of the entity on as as if converted basis. This is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders, as adjusted if necessary, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive securities.   Weighted average shares outstanding were 21,096,182 and 19,772,491 for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Outstanding common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of diluted losses per share because their effect would be antidilutive.   Cash Flows   The Company considers unrestricted cash and cash investments with initial maturity or marketability of three months or less to be cash equivalents for purposes of presenting its Statement of Cash Flows. Cash investments whose use is limited through collateral restrictions are not considered to be cash for cash flows.   Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.   Financial Instruments   Unless otherwise specified, management believes the carrying value of its financial instruments approximates their fair value due to the short term to maturity.   Reclassifications   Certain 2010 amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the 2011 financial statement presentation.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   The FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The codification has changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP guidance is referenced, but did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income . This update provides the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The Company does not believe that this will materially impact the presentation of its financial statements.    In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS . This update does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. This update may require certain additional disclosures related to fair value measurements. We do not expect the adoption of this update will materially impact our financial statement disclosures.   In December 2010, the FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-29 (ASU 2010-29), Business Combinations (Topic 805)  Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations . This Accounting Standards Update requires a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period. The disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period. The amendments in this Update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010.  Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-29 to have a material effect on our financial statements.   In   July 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2010-20 (ASU 2010-20), Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.   The amendments in this Update are to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about an entitys allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. The disclosures about activity that occurs during the reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010.  The Company does not expect the provisions of ASU 2010-20 to have a material effect on our financial statements.   In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09 Subsequent Events (ASC Topic 855) - Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements (ASU 2010-09).  ASU No. 2010-09 requires an entity that is an SEC filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which the filer had evaluated subsequent events. The adoption did not have an impact on the Companys financial statements.   In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820)  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. This ASU requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The adoption did not have an impact on our financial statement.   Also in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, Extractive ActivitiesOil and GasOil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.  This ASU amends the Extractive IndustriesOil and Gas Topic of the Codification to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements in this Topic with the SECs Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule), discussed below.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009, and the adoption of these provisions on December 31, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

        Subsequent Events [Text Block]
        NOTE 8: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   We have evaluated events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2011 through the date the financial statements were ready for issuance as noted below:   The Company acquired a 100% Working Interest in PL 18, PL 40, and a 50% Working Interest in PL 280, located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland Australia. This basin was home to the first oil discovery in Australia, and is currently the focus of significant coal-seam gas exploration and production activity by others. In connection with the transaction, the Company sold 5,473,385 shares for cash and issued 21,780,935 shares to the sellers.   The assets acquired by the Company include 5 oilfields: Yellowbank Creek, Thomby Creek, Louise, McWhirter, Narrows and Beardmore. These fields were developed in the 1970's and 1980's, and have collectively produced approximately 7-10% of the estimated oil originally in place ("OOIP"). The Company believes that up to 50% of the OOIP is potentially recoverable through the application of well-established enhanced recovery techniques including downspacing, horizontal drilling, and reservoir pressure maintenance through waterflooding.   In 2007, the vendors of the Surat assets (the "Vendors") obtained an independent resource report by CDS Data Services Pty Ltd. ("CDS Report") to assess the remaining recoverable oil resources in the 5 fields. The CDS Report provided a range of 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to 6.7 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil resources. Since 2007, there has been no significant investment in the fields as the Vendors were unsuccessful in securing the necessary capital to develop the remaining oil resources. The fields were recently producing 4 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of high quality 51 degree oil, which is sold at a premium of approximately US$8.50 above Brent crude oil price, or a premium of approximately US$24.00 above West Texas Intermediate crude oil price.   After the acquisition, the Company currently has 50,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 49,960,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has agreed to hold an annual and special meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable, in order to, among other things, amend the authorized share capital of the Company to provide for an unlimited number of shares of common stock. Upon such amendments taking effect and in accordance with the terms of the share exchange agreement dated November 17, 2011 (the "Share Exchange Agreement") among ACOR, 1629518 Alberta Ltd. and certain other parties thereto, the Company will issue an additional 69,065 shares of the Company to Bill Petrie Sr, Bill Petrie Jr, and Jesse Meidl, along with the issuance of 5,000,000 Share Purchase Warrants of ACOR (the "Warrants") to certain persons in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The Warrants will have a strike price of US$0.25 per share, and will only vest if the Company trades at a price above US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days, with a total of 100,000 Company shares trading during the 10 day period, and expire 24 months after the date of issuance.   The Company has agreed to pay the Vendors US$3.0 million within 12 months of the closing of the Acquisition (the "Deferred Consideration"). The Vendors have secured a first lien over PL 18, PL 40, and PL 280. The Company intends to secure a reserve based lending facility to refinance the Deferred Consideration, which does not accrue interest or other charges within 12 months of closing.   The Board of the Company are pleased to add two experienced oil industry executives: William Petrie Sr. and Jesse Meidl.   Mr. Petrie has in excess of 35 years' experience as a petroleum geologist, primarily in Western Canada. He began his career with Mobil Oil, leaving after several years to join the independent sector. He has been involved as President and Director for a number of public and private oil and gas companies. In these positions he was responsible for generating, evaluating, and successfully exploiting oil and gas exploration, development, and acquisition opportunities throughout North America.   Mr. Meidl has over 15 years of experience in the oil and gas sector. He is Chief Financial Officer of a private international energy company, headquartered in London, England. Prior thereto, he was an investment banker in the International Oil & Gas group of Thomas Weisel Partners in London (Now Stifel Nicolas). Mr. Meidl was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Arsenal Energy Inc., an international exploration company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which held production assets in Canada and the USA and exploration assets in Egypt, Colombia and Uzbekistan. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG in Calgary, where he specialized in oil and gas exploration and production and services. He also holds the ICAEW Corporate Finance qualification and a B. Comm. degree from the University of Saskatchewan (Canada).   It is planned that during the second quarter of 2012, the Company will be undertaking a workover program of certain wells on PL 40 and PL 280 which will reactivate two old wells at a cost of A$400,000. The workover program is anticipated to bring total field production to approximately 25 barrels of oil per day.   The Company will also be obtaining an updated reserve and resource report over all of the assets in the Company's portfolio, including the Surat basin assets and ATP 582. It is anticipated the report will be finalized in the second quarter of 2012.

        Going Concern Note
        NOTE 10: GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS   As of December 31, 2011, the Company has limited disposable cash and its revenues are not sufficient to, and cannot be projected to, cover operating expenses and expansion by the Company. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Managements plans include attempting to raise funds from the public through a stock offering, and attempting to acquire additional producing interests in exchange for stock. Management intends to make every effort to identify and develop sources of funds. There is no assurance that Management will be successful. The Company is effectively debt free and could continue to operate at subsistence levels pending development of funding sources.

                Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest, minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.
