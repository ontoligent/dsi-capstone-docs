PART I
Item 1.
Business
Introduction
We are a developer, owner and operator of casino entertainment facilities in local and regional markets. Ameristar has been a public company since November 1993. We have eight properties in seven markets.
Our goal is to capitalize on our high-quality facilities and products and dedication to superior guest service to effectively compete in each of our markets and to drive growth from our existing and additionally developed or acquired properties, which creates value for our stockholders. In 2010, we celebrated the success of the first full year of operating with a new hotel and under favorable regulatory changes at Ameristar Black Hawk. We recently completed the renovation of all 288 hotel rooms and suites at our East Chicago property. In January 2012, we purchased a 40-acre site in Springfield, Massachusetts, with the intent to apply for the sole casino license for western Massachusetts and, if awarded, build a luxury hotel and entertainment resort.
We believe the Ameristar experience differentiates us from our competitors. That experience is built upon our high-quality facilities and products, such as slots, food, lodging, entertainment and the appreciative service our 7,200 team members offer our guests. Our casinos feature spacious gaming floors and typically have the largest number of gaming positions in our markets. We believe we feature more of the newest and most popular slot machines than any other casino in each market. We design the flow of our casino floors to attractively position and draw attention to our newest and most popular games and provide convenient access to other amenities, which we believe creates a more entertaining experience for our guests.
Most of our revenue comes from slot play, but we also offer a wide range of table games, including blackjack, craps, roulette and poker in the majority of our markets. We set minimum and maximum betting limits for the properties based on competitive conditions and other factors. Our gaming revenues are derived from a broad base of guests, and we do not depend exclusively upon high- or low- stakes players. We extend gaming credit at our properties in Indiana, Mississippi and Nevada.
Our hotels offer upscale accommodations with tastefully appointed rooms offering appealing amenities. Our signature dining concepts include steakhouses, elaborate buffets and casual dining restaurants, including sports bars. Whether in our steakhouses or delis, our emphasis is on quality in all aspects of the dining experience — food, service, ambiance and facilities. The private Star Clubs offer our Star Awards members an exclusive place to relax at all but our Jackpot properties.

Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles.
 Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles serves the greater St. Louis metropolitan market with a large casino and a variety of amenities, including our luxury all-suite hotel and spa. We believe the hotel’s expansive luxury suites rank among the greater St. Louis area’s most upscale accommodations. The hotel also features a 7,000-square-foot, full-service spa and an indoor/outdoor pool. The hotel has held the prestigious American Automobile Association (“AAA”) Four Diamond designation since 2009. The property has seven dining venues, a state-of-the-art conference and banquet center and several bars.
The property is located immediately north of the Interstate 70 bridge at the Missouri River, strategically situated to attract patrons from the St. Charles and greater St. Louis areas, as well as tourists from outside the region. The property is in close proximity to the St. Charles convention facility. Interstate 70 is a 10-lane, east-west freeway offering easy access to, and direct visibility of, the Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles site.
Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City.
 Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City ranks among the largest state-licensed casino floors in the United States. Our hotel offers a mix of suites and standard rooms that feature custom finishes. Guests can select from nine restaurants and seven bars/lounges.
Located seven miles from downtown Kansas City, Missouri, Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City attracts guests from the greater Kansas City area, as well as regional overnight guests. The property is in close proximity to the Interstate 435 bridge over the Missouri River. Interstate 435 is a six-lane, north-south expressway offering easy access to, and direct visibility of, Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City.
Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs.
 Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs serves the Omaha and southwestern Iowa markets. The property’s hotel and Main Street Pavilion comprise its landside facilities. Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs’ 160 rooms include luxury suites and king whirlpool rooms. Ameristar Council Bluffs has held the AAA Four Diamond designation since 1997. The property also offers dining and meeting space.
Located across the Missouri River from Omaha, the property is adjacent to the Nebraska Avenue exit on Interstate 29, immediately north of the junction of Interstate 29 and Interstate 80, which  offers easy access to, and direct visibility of, Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs.
Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk.
 Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk is one of the largest casinos in Colorado. It is a premier gaming and resort destination with a luxury hotel. The 33-story hotel tower offers both luxury rooms and suites and a meeting and event center. In 2011, the hotel was awarded the AAA Four Diamond designation. It has Black Hawk’s only full-service spa, an enclosed rooftop swimming pool and indoor/outdoor whirlpool spas. We believe these amenities and services are unequaled in the Denver gaming market. The property also has four dining venues and several bars.
Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk is located in the center of the Black Hawk gaming district, approximately 40 miles west of Denver, and it caters primarily to patrons from the Denver metropolitan area and surrounding states.
Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg.
 Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg has been the market leader since 1994, a distinction we attribute to its superior location and premier gaming, lodging and dining offerings. The property has the market’s only live poker room and a 1,000-space parking garage with direct access to the casino. The three-level dockside casino is significantly wider than most other casinos in the market, providing a spacious, land-based feel. The property has three dining venues and meeting space.
Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg is located one-quarter mile north of Interstate 20 in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The property is easily accessible and visible from the highway exit ramp and is the closest casino to I-20, a major east-west thoroughfare that connects Atlanta and Dallas. Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg caters primarily to guests from the Vicksburg and Jackson, Mississippi and Monroe, Louisiana areas, along with tourists visiting the area.
Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago.
 Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago serves metropolitan Chicago and Northwest Indiana, the United States’ third-largest commercial gaming market. East Chicago’s dining choices include six restaurants and two bars. The property also features a newly renovated hotel, banquet space and a Star Club players’ lounge.
Located approximately 25 miles from downtown Chicago, Illinois, Ameristar East Chicago currently draws a majority of its guest base from Illinois.
The Jackpot Properties.
 Cactus Petes Resort Casino and The Horseshu Hotel and Casino are located in Jackpot, Nevada, just south of the Idaho border. Cactus Petes has been operating since 1956. The properties’ resort amenities include a hotel, an Olympic-sized pool, a heated spa, a styling salon, a recreational vehicle park and access to a nearby 18-hole golf course. In addition, an adjacent general store and service station serve guests and regional travelers. The properties also offer several dining selections and a showroom. Approximately 89 hotel rooms at Cactus Petes are scheduled to be remodeled in the summer of 2012.
The properties are located on either side of Nevada State Highway 93, a major regional north-south route, and serve 
6
guests primarily from Idaho, and secondarily from Oregon, Washington, Montana, northern California and the southwestern Canadian provinces.
Growth Strategies
We anticipate that our growth will come from disciplined expansions at selected properties and through strategic acquisitions and new developments.
We continuously review the operating performance of each of our existing properties and the feasibility of enhancing their performance through targeted capital expenditure programs. In doing so, we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration, the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors.
In addition to internal expansion opportunities, we selectively evaluate external expansion opportunities to broaden our overall distribution and increase scale and diversification. We focus on the potential acquisition of existing casino-entertainment properties that can be improved through the implementation of our development and operational expertise. We also consider new development opportunities in existing and emerging markets. In January 2012, we purchased a 40-acre site in Springfield, Massachusetts, with the intent to apply for the sole casino license for western Massachusetts and, if awarded, build a luxury hotel and entertainment resort. Although our preference is to own and operate each of our gaming properties, we may also evaluate expansion opportunities involving management contracts or joint ventures. We are also monitoring legislative and regulatory developments that may create opportunities for us to engage in online gaming.

The Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission reports the Black Hawk and Central City, Colorado markets separately. The Black Hawk information in this table excludes eight casinos in Central City, adjacent to Black Hawk, which generated $67.8 million in total gaming revenues in 2011.
(2)
 
In the Northwest Indiana market, there are a total of three operators, including Ameristar East Chicago (located in East Chicago, Hammond and Gary, Indiana), that generated $1.0 billion in annual gaming revenues in 2011. In the broader Chicagoland market, there are six additional state-licensed casinos operating in the states of Illinois and Indiana and one Native American casino in Michigan. The nine state-licensed casinos generated a total of $2.1 billion in annual gaming revenues in 2011.
(3)
 
A new competitor opened a casino and entertainment facility on February 3, 2012 at the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County, Kansas.
The primary market area for the Jackpot properties is Twin Falls, Idaho (located approximately 45 miles north of Jackpot) and Boise, Idaho (located approximately 150 miles from Jackpot). The primary market area comprises approximately 600,000 adults. The balance of the Jackpot properties’ guests comes primarily from the northwestern United States and southwestern 
7
Canada. As of December 31, 2011, the Jackpot properties had approximately 57% of the slot machines and 73% of the table game positions in the Jackpot market.
Competition
St. Charles
Ameristar St. Charles competes with five other gaming operations located in the metropolitan St. Louis area. Two of these competitors are located in Illinois. Illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than Missouri casinos. They are also subject to gaming position limitations and a statewide indoor smoking ban. Illinois casinos are allowed to extend gaming credit to their patrons, while Missouri regulations do not allow gaming credit to be given. The St. Louis market is currently insulated from other casino gaming markets, with no competitors within 100 miles.
In December 2010, the Missouri Gaming Commission allowed an operator to commence construction of a new casino property in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, approximately 100 miles southeast of the St. Louis market. Construction of that property began in 2011 and is projected to open in December 2012, as the state’s thirteenth casino. Assuming the successful completion and licensing of the Cape Girardeau property, no additional gaming licenses will be awarded in the State of Missouri, as the number of permitted casinos was capped at 13 by referendum in 2008.
We currently do not anticipate any new competition in the Illinois portion of the St. Louis market. However, increased competition for our St. Charles property would result if Illinois law is changed in the future to allow the operation of slot machines at the existing pari-mutuel racetrack near East St. Louis. This has been proposed from time to time by members of the Illinois legislature.
Kansas City
Ameristar Kansas City competes with five other gaming operations located in and around Kansas City, Missouri. The newest competitor began operations in February 2012 at the Kansas Speedway in Wyandotte County, Kansas, approximately 24 miles from Ameristar Kansas City. Ameristar Kansas City’s location is the farthest east from the new casino, which may mitigate the impact on our casino. The shuttered pari-mutuel racetrack in Wyandotte County, Kansas has been authorized by the Kansas legislature to offer slot machines. However, the owner of the facility has opted not to reopen the facility and offer the machines due to the high tax rate imposed on these machines. If the race track were to reopen, we would face additional competition at Ameristar Kansas City.
Council Bluffs
Ameristar Council Bluffs operates one of three gaming licenses issued in the Council Bluffs gaming market pursuant to an operating agreement with Iowa West Racing Association. The two other licenses are operated by a single company and consist of another riverboat casino and a land-based casino with a pari-mutuel racetrack.
The Council Bluffs market is insulated from other casino gaming markets, with the nearest competitor located approximately 90 miles away.
In 2007, the National Indian Gaming Commission (the “NIGC”) approved the request of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska to allow a five-acre parcel owned by the tribe in Carter Lake, Iowa to be utilized for gaming purposes. The parcel is located approximately five miles from Ameristar Council Bluffs. In 2008, in a lawsuit brought by the State of Nebraska and joined by the State of Iowa and the City of Council Bluffs, the federal district court reversed the NIGC’s decision. The U.S. Department of the Interior appealed the district court ruling, and in 2010 the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the NIGC for further consideration. The Court of Appeals directed the NIGC to revisit the issue, taking into consideration, among other things, a 2003 agreement between the State of Iowa and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. That agreement stated that the five-acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes. If the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location, the additional competition would adversely affect our Council Bluffs casino.
Black Hawk
Ameristar Black Hawk competes with 25 other gaming operations located in the Black Hawk and Central City gaming market in Colorado. Ameristar has the largest gaming floor and parking garage of any casino in the market. Of the other casinos in the market, only four are considered “large” operators, with over 750 slot machines. Ameristar’s primary competitor is one of the first major casinos encountered when entering Black Hawk from Denver via State Route 119. This competitor’s primary casino is connected via a skywalk to an adjacent casino the operator also owns, thereby offering increased availability of hotel rooms, parking capacity and gaming positions to guests.
The Black Hawk and Central City gaming market is insulated from other casino gaming markets, with no competitors 
8
within 50 miles. There have been proposals for the development of Native American, racetrack and video lottery terminal casinos throughout the state over the years. None of the proposals has been adopted by the state’s electorate or by the legislature.
Should any form of additional gaming be authorized in the Denver metropolitan area, the Black Hawk and Central City market would be adversely affected.
Vicksburg
Ameristar Vicksburg currently competes with four other gaming operations located in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Vicksburg is located approximately 45 miles west of Mississippi’s largest city, Jackson.
Proposals have been made from time to time to develop new Native American casinos in Louisiana and Mississippi, some of which could be competitive with the Vicksburg market. None are under construction currently.
The Vicksburg market also faces competition from two casinos owned by a Native American tribe in Philadelphia, Mississippi, located about 70 miles east of Jackson and 115 miles east of Vicksburg. Vicksburg is also subject to competition from four casinos and one slots-only racetrack in Shreveport and Bossier City, Louisiana, located approximately 175 miles from Vicksburg, as well as casinos located along the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
East Chicago
Ameristar East Chicago’s core competitive market of Northwest Indiana is comprised of three casino operators, including Ameristar, in East Chicago, Hammond and Gary, Indiana. The three properties are located within five miles of each other on Lake Michigan. The property also competes with seven other casinos located in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan within 60 miles of East Chicago. Ameristar East Chicago’s newest competitor began operations in July 2011. It is located in Des Plaines, Illinois, which is approximately 40 miles northwest of East Chicago, Indiana.
Illinois casinos are subject to higher gaming taxes than Indiana casinos. They are also subject to gaming position limitations and a statewide indoor smoking ban. Located within the Chicago metropolitan area, Ameristar East Chicago currently draws a majority of its guest base from Illinois.
Legislation attempting to further expand gaming in Illinois has been considered by the Illinois legislature over the years. If enacted, Ameristar East Chicago could face significant additional competition.
In 2009, the Indiana Department of Transportation (“INDOT”) permanently closed the Cline Avenue bridge near Ameristar East Chicago due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge. The closure has forced Ameristar’s guests to utilize alternative routes to access the property. This has caused the property’s business levels and operating results to suffer. Recently, INDOT has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road. There is no assurance that this will occur. If it does not, area surface streets are expected to be improved by INDOT.
Jackpot
The Jackpot properties compete with three other hotels and motels (all of which also have casinos) in Jackpot and a Native American casino near Pocatello, Idaho. The Native American casino operates video lottery terminals, which are similar to slot machines.
Other
In addition to the competition that our properties face from other casinos in their geographic markets, we also compete, to a lesser extent, with casinos in other locations, including major tourist destinations such as Las Vegas, with gaming on cruise ships and with other forms of gaming in the United States, including state-sponsored lotteries, racetracks, off-track wagering, Internet and other account wagering and card parlors.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of February 15, 2012, we employed approximately 4,775 full-time and 2,435 part-time employees. Approximately 230 employees at our East Chicago property are employed pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.
Incorporation
Ameristar was incorporated in Nevada in 1993.

Government Regulation
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. We are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming. The limitation, conditioning or suspension of gaming licenses could (and the revocation or non-renewal of gaming licenses would) materially adversely affect our operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, changes in law that restrict or prohibit our gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on us.
Missouri
Our gaming operations in St. Charles and Kansas City, Missouri are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries, Ameristar Casino St. Charles, Inc. (“ACSCI”) and Ameristar Casino Kansas City, Inc. (“ACKCI”), respectively. The ownership and operation of riverboat and dockside gaming facilities in Missouri are subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Missouri Gaming Commission. The Licensed Gaming Activities Chapter of the Missouri Revised Statutes (the “Missouri Act”) provides for the licensing and regulation of riverboat and dockside gaming operations on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers in the State of Missouri and the licensing and regulation of persons who distribute gaming equipment and supplies to gaming licensees.
The Missouri Gaming Commission has discretion to approve gaming license applications for permanently moored (“dockside”) casinos, powered (“excursion”) riverboat casinos and barges and to determine the type of excursion gambling boats allowed each licensee. The total number of excursion gambling boat licenses may not exceed 13. Due to safety concerns, all gaming vessels on the Missouri River are permitted to be moored in moats within 1,000 feet of the river. Gaming licenses are initially issued for two one-year periods and must be renewed every two years thereafter. The gaming licenses held by ACSCI and ACKCI are next subject to renewal in October 2012. No gaming licensee may pledge or transfer in any way any license, or any interest in a license, issued by the Missouri Gaming Commission. As a result, the gaming licenses of our Missouri subsidiaries were not pledged to secure our senior credit facility.
The issuance, transfer and pledge of ownership interests in a gaming licensee are also subject to strict notice and approval requirements. Missouri Gaming Commission regulations prohibit a licensee from doing any of the following without at least 60 days’ prior notice to the Missouri Gaming Commission, and during such period, the Missouri Gaming Commission may disapprove the transaction or require the transaction be delayed pending further investigation:
•
any transfer or issuance of an ownership interest in a gaming licensee that is not a publicly held entity or a holding company that is not a publicly held entity, and
•
any pledge or grant of a security interest in an ownership interest in a gaming licensee that is not a publicly held entity or a holding company that is not a publicly held entity; provided that no ownership interest may be transferred in any way pursuant to any pledge or security interest without separate notice to the Missouri Gaming Commission at least 30 days prior to such transfer, which restriction must be specifically included in the pledge or grant of a security interest.
Under the Missouri Act, all members of the Boards of Directors of ACSCI and ACKCI, certain members of their managements and certain of their employees associated with their gaming businesses are required to obtain and maintain occupational licenses. We believe that all such persons currently required to obtain occupational licenses have obtained or applied for them. The Missouri Gaming Commission may deny an application for a license for any cause that it deems reasonable.
Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by a gaming licensee must be reported to and approved by the Missouri Gaming Commission. Missouri Gaming Commission regulations require a licensee to notify the Missouri Gaming Commission of its intention to consummate any of the following transactions at least 15 days prior to such consummation, and the Missouri Gaming Commission may reopen the licensing hearing prior to or following the consummation date to consider the effect of the transaction on the licensee’s suitability:
•
any issuance of an ownership interest in a publicly held gaming licensee or a publicly held holding company, if such issuance would involve, directly or indirectly, an amount of ownership interest equaling 5% or greater of the ownership interest in the gaming licensee or holding company after the issuance is complete,
•
any private incurrence of debt equal to or exceeding $1 million by a gaming licensee or holding company that is affiliated with the holder of a license,
•
any public issuance of debt by a gaming licensee or holding company that is affiliated with the holder of a license, and
•
any significant related party transaction as defined in the regulations.
The Missouri Gaming Commission may waive or reduce the 15-day notice requirement.
10
The Missouri Act imposes operational requirements on riverboat operators, including an admission fee of $2 per gaming guest that licensees must pay to the Missouri Gaming Commission, certain minimum payout requirements, a 21% tax on adjusted gross receipts, prohibitions against providing credit to gaming guests (except, subject to certain conditions, for the use of credit and debit cards and the cashing of checks) and a requirement that each licensee reimburse the Missouri Gaming Commission for all costs of any Missouri Gaming Commission staff necessary to protect the public on the licensee’s riverboat. Licensees must also submit audited quarterly and annual financial reports to the Missouri Gaming Commission and pay the associated auditing fees. Other areas of operation that are subject to regulation under Missouri rules are the size, denomination and handling of chips and tokens, the surveillance methods and computer monitoring of electronic games, accounting and audit methods and procedures and approval of an extensive internal control system. The Missouri rules also require that all of an operator’s chips, tokens, dice, playing cards and electronic gaming devices must be acquired from suppliers licensed by the Missouri Gaming Commission or another person or entity approved by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
Although the Missouri Act provides no limit on the amount of riverboat space that may be used for gaming, the Missouri Gaming Commission can impose space limitations through the adoption of rules and regulations. Additionally, United States Coast Guard safety regulations could affect the amount of riverboat space that may be devoted to gaming. The Missouri Act also includes requirements as to the form of riverboats, which must resemble Missouri’s riverboat history to the extent practicable and include certain non-gaming amenities. All licensees currently operating riverboat gaming operations in Missouri are authorized to conduct all or a portion of their operations on a dockside basis, and open and continuous boarding is permitted. Gaming is permitted to be conducted 24 hours each day, with the exception of one hour per week.
The Missouri Act requires each licensee to post a bond or other surety to guarantee that the licensee complies with its statutory obligations. The Missouri Act also gives the Missouri Gaming Commission the authority to use the bond or other form of surety to, among other things, guarantee the completion of an expansion of a gaming facility within a time period determined by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
To promote safety, the Missouri Gaming Commission has required that gaming entertainment barges obtain annual certification from the American Bureau of Shipping.
If the Missouri Gaming Commission decides that a licensee, such as one of our Missouri subsidiaries, violated a gaming law or regulation, the Missouri Gaming Commission could limit, condition, suspend or revoke the license of the licensee. In addition, a licensee, its parent company and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license could (and revocation of any gaming license would) materially adversely affect Ameristar and our Missouri subsidiaries’ gaming operations.
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Missouri Act, a holder of any direct or indirect legal or beneficial publicly traded interest in excess of five percent in a gaming licensee, applicant or key person is required, unless exempted, to be licensed as a key person by the Missouri Gaming Commission. A holder, for passive investment purposes, of such a direct or indirect interest that is not more than 10% may be exempted from such licensure by the executive director of the Missouri Gaming Commission, and a holder of up to 20% may be exempted by the Missouri Gaming Commission, if such holder applies in advance of acquiring such interest or within 10 days thereafter and certifies certain information under oath, including that it (i) is acquiring the interest for passive investment purposes; (ii) does not and will not have any involvement in the management activities of the entity; (iii) does not have any intention of controlling the entity regardless of additional stock that may be acquired; (iv) will within 10 days notify the Missouri Gaming Commission of any sale or purchase of more than 1% of the entity’s outstanding stock; and (v) will, in the event that it subsequently develops an intention of controlling or participating in the management of such entity, notify the Missouri Gaming Commission and refrain from participating in management or exercising control until approved for licensure by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
The Missouri Gaming Commission regulates the issuance of excursion liquor licenses, which authorize the licensee to serve, offer for sale, or sell intoxicating liquor aboard any excursion gambling boat, or facility immediately adjacent to and contiguous with the excursion gambling boat, which is owned and operated by the licensee. An excursion liquor license is granted for a one-year term by the Missouri Gaming Commission and is renewable annually. The Missouri Gaming Commission can discipline an excursion liquor licensee for any violation of Missouri law or the Missouri Gaming Commission’s rules. Licensees are responsible for the conduct of their business and for any act or conduct of any employee on the premises that is in violation of the Missouri Act or the rules of the Missouri Gaming Commission. Missouri Gaming Commission liquor control regulations also include prohibitions on certain intoxicating liquor promotions and a ban on fees accepted for advertising products. Only persons, such as ACSCI and ACKCI, that hold licenses granted by the Missouri Gaming Commission allowing the holder to conduct gambling games on an excursion gambling boat and to operate an excursion gambling boat can obtain an excursion liquor license from the Missouri Gaming Commission. The sale of alcoholic beverages produced at Amerisports at Ameristar Kansas City is subject to licensing, control and regulation by the City of Kansas City, Missouri, Clay County, the State of Missouri and the Division of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the U.S. Treasury Department.

Iowa
Ameristar’s Council Bluffs operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary, Ameristar Casino Council Bluffs, Inc. (“ACCBI”), and are subject to Chapter 99F of the Iowa Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. ACCBI’s gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (the “Iowa Gaming Commission”).
Under Iowa law, wagering on a “gambling game” is legal when conducted by a licensee on an “excursion gambling boat.” An “excursion gambling boat” is an excursion boat or moored barge on which lawful gambling is authorized and licensed. “Gambling game” means any game of chance authorized by the Iowa Gaming Commission. In 2004, the Iowa legislature eliminated the mandatory cruising requirement for an “excursion gambling boat,” and ACCBI’s riverboat is now classified as a “permanently moored vessel.”
The legislation permitting riverboat gaming in Iowa authorizes the granting of licenses to “qualified sponsoring organizations.” A “qualified sponsoring organization” is defined as a person or association that can show to the satisfaction of the Iowa Gaming Commission that the person or association is eligible for exemption from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (10) or (19) of the Internal Revenue Code (hereinafter “not-for-profit corporation”). The not-for-profit corporation is permitted to enter into operating agreements with persons qualified to conduct riverboat gaming operations. Such operators must be approved and licensed by the Iowa Gaming Commission. On January 27, 1995, the Iowa Gaming Commission authorized the issuance of a license to conduct gambling games on an excursion gambling boat to Iowa West Racing Association (the “Association”), a not-for-profit corporation organized for the purpose of facilitating riverboat gaming in Council Bluffs. The Association has entered into a sponsorship agreement with ACCBI (the “Operator’s Contract”) authorizing ACCBI to operate riverboat gaming operations in Council Bluffs under the Association’s gaming license, and the Iowa Gaming Commission has approved this contract. The term of the Operator’s Contract runs until March 31, 2015, and ACCBI has an option to extend the term for an additional three-year period through March 31, 2018.
Under Iowa law, a license to conduct gambling games in a county shall be issued only if the county electorate approves such gambling games. The electorate of Pottawattamie County, which includes the City of Council Bluffs, most recently reauthorized by referendum in November 2010 the gambling games conducted by ACCBI. After a referendum has been held which approved or defeated a proposal to conduct gambling games, another referendum on a proposal to conduct gambling games shall not be held until the eighth calendar year thereafter. Each such referendum requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the persons voting thereon. However, if a proposition to operate gambling games is approved by a majority of the county electorate voting on the proposition in two successive elections, a subsequent submission and approval of a proposition shall not thereafter be required, unless the board of supervisors for that county receives a valid petition requesting a referendum to approve or disapprove the conduct of gambling games. In the event a future reauthorization referendum is defeated, the licenses granted to the Association and ACCBI would be subject to renewal for a total of nine years from the date of original issue or one year from the date of the referendum disapproving the conduct of gambling games, whichever is later, unless the Iowa Gaming Commission revokes a license at an earlier date, at which time ACCBI would be required to cease conducting gambling games. The referendum in November 2010 was at least the second successive election approving the conduct of gambling games in Pottawattamie County.
Substantially all of ACCBI’s material transactions are subject to review and approval by the Iowa Gaming Commission. Written and oral contracts and business arrangements involving a related party or in which the term exceeds three years or the total value in a calendar year exceeds $100,000 are agreements that qualify for submission to and approval by the Iowa Gaming Commission (“Qualifying Agreements”). Qualifying Agreements are limited to: (1) any obligations that expend, encumber or lend ACCBI assets to anyone other than a not-for-profit entity or a unit of government for the payment of taxes and utilities; (2) any disposal of ACCBI assets or the provision of goods and services at less than market value to anyone other than a not-for-profit entity or a unit of government; (3) a previously approved Qualifying Agreement, if consideration exceeds the approved amount by the greater of $100,000 or 25%; and (4) any type of contract, regardless of value or term, where a third party provides electronic access to cash or credit for a patron of the facility. Each Qualifying Agreement must be submitted to the Iowa Gaming Commission within 30 days of execution. Iowa Gaming Commission approval must be obtained prior to implementation, unless the Qualifying Agreement contains a written clause stating that the agreement is subject to Iowa Gaming Commission approval. Qualifying Agreements that are ongoing or open-ended need only be submitted on initiation, unless there is a material change in terms or noncompliance with the requirement that consideration be given to the use of Iowa resources, goods and services. Additionally, contracts negotiated between ACCBI and a related party must be accompanied by economic and qualitative justification.
ACCBI is required to maintain records regarding its equity structure and owners. The Iowa Gaming Commission may require ACCBI to submit background information on all persons participating in any capacity at ACCBI. The Iowa Gaming Commission may suspend or revoke the license of a licensee if the licensee is found to be ineligible in any respect, such as want of character, moral fitness, financial responsibility or due to failure to meet other criteria employed by the Iowa Gaming Commission.
ACCBI must submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Iowa Gaming Commission. ACCBI must file weekly and monthly gaming reports indicating adjusted gross receipts received from gambling games, the total number and amount 
12
of money received from admissions and the amount of regulatory fees paid. Additionally, ACCBI must file annual financial statements covering all financial activities related to its operations for each fiscal year.
Iowa has a graduated wagering tax equal to 5% of the first $1.0 million of annual adjusted gross receipts, 10% of the next $2.0 million of annual adjusted gross receipts and 22% of annual adjusted gross receipts over $3.0 million for an excursion gambling boat. In addition, the state charges other fees on a per-guest basis. Additionally, ACCBI pays the City of Council Bluffs a fee equal to $0.50 per passenger. Under the Operator’s Contract, ACCBI also pays the Association a fee equal to 3% of adjusted gross receipts.
All persons participating in any capacity at a gaming facility, with the exception of certified law enforcement officers while they are working for the facility as uniformed officers, are required to obtain occupational licenses from the Iowa Gaming Commission. All such licenses must be renewed every two years. The Iowa Gaming Commission has broad discretion to deny or revoke any occupational license.
If the Iowa Gaming Commission decides that a gaming law or regulation has been violated, the Iowa Gaming Commission has the power to assess fines, revoke or suspend licenses or to take any other action as may be reasonable or appropriate to enforce the gaming rules and regulations.
ACCBI is subject to licensure by the Alcoholic Beverages Division (“ABD”) of the Iowa Department of Commerce, which administers and enforces the laws of the State of Iowa concerning alcoholic beverages. Additionally, ACCBI is subject to liquor ordinances adopted by local authorities. A local authority may adopt ordinances governing establishments that are located within their jurisdiction. Local ordinances may be more restrictive than state law, but they may not conflict with state law. The ABD and the local authorities have full power to suspend or revoke any license for the serving of alcoholic beverages.
Indiana
Ameristar conducts its Indiana gaming operations through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC, which owns and operates Ameristar East Chicago in East Chicago, Indiana. The ownership and operation of casino facilities in Indiana are subject to extensive state and local regulation, including primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Indiana Gaming Commission (the “Commission”). The Commission is given extensive powers and duties for administering, regulating and enforcing riverboat gaming in Indiana.
Pursuant to the Indiana Riverboat Gaming Act, as amended (the “Indiana Act”), the Commission is authorized to award up to 10 owner’s licenses and one operating agent contract for purposes of owning and operating riverboat casinos in the State of Indiana. This includes five licenses for riverboat casinos in counties contiguous to Lake Michigan in northern Indiana, five licenses for riverboat casinos in certain counties contiguous to the Ohio River in southern Indiana and one operating agent contract for a riverboat casino in a county that contains a historic hotel district (i.e., Orange County). Referenda required by the Indiana Act to authorize the five licenses to be issued for counties contiguous to Lake Michigan have been conducted. In these counties, gaming has been authorized for the cities of Hammond, East Chicago, and Gary in Lake County, Indiana, and for Michigan City in LaPorte County, Indiana, to the east of Lake County. In April 2007, the Indiana General Assembly enacted legislation that empowered the Commission to issue gambling game licenses to the holders of Indiana’s two pari-mutuel horse racing permits. In March 2008, the Commission granted each permit holder a five-year gambling game license authorizing the installation and use of up to 2,000 slot machines at each horse track, one of which is located in Anderson and the other in Shelbyville, Indiana. The slot operations at the tracks opened in the second quarter of 2008. Under Indiana law, installation of slot machines beyond the statutorily authorized number of 2,000 would require further approval by the Commission. In November 2011, the Commission authorized the Indiana Live! casino in Shelbyville to install up to 2,200 slot machines at its facility.
The Indiana Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations pursuant to the police powers of Indiana, including comprehensive law enforcement provisions. The Indiana Act vests the Commission with the power and duties of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of riverboat gaming in Indiana. The Commission’s jurisdiction extends to every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in Indiana.
The Indiana Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an owner’s license issued by the Commission. To obtain an owner’s license, the Indiana Act requires extensive disclosure of records and other information concerning an applicant. Applicants for licensure must submit a comprehensive application and personal disclosure forms and undergo an exhaustive background investigation prior to the issuance of a license. The Commission has the authority to request specific information on or license anyone who holds an ownership interest or anyone who plays a key management role, such as officers, directors, and employees, regardless of ownership. The applicant may be required to disclose the identity of every person holding an ownership interest in the applicant. Persons holding an interest of 5% or more in the applicant normally must undergo a background investigation and be licensed. Institutional investors, within the meaning of the Indiana Act, are generally exempted from this requirement pursuant to administrative rule. To qualify for a potential exemption, the investor must acquire the shares in the 
13
ordinary course of business for investment purposes. The shares cannot be acquired either for the purpose of electing a majority of the board of directors of the licensee or for the purpose of changing the licensee’s charter, management, policies or operations. Institutional investors are defined to include certain retirement funds, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, collective investment trusts organized by banks under the rules of the Comptroller of the Currency, closed-end investment trusts, chartered or licensed life insurance or property and casualty insurance companies, banking institutions, investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 and such other entities as the Commission may determine.
Each owner’s license entitles the licensee to own and operate one riverboat along with the associated gaming equipment. The Indiana Act allows a person to hold up to 100% of up to two individual riverboat owner’s licenses.
Each initial owner’s license runs for a period of five years. Thereafter, the license is subject to renewal on an annual basis upon a determination by the Commission that the licensee continues to be eligible for an owner’s license pursuant to the Indiana Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder. Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC submitted an application for the required annual license renewal in 2011 and such license renewal was approved by the Commission on June 2, 2011.
The Indiana Act requires that a licensed owner undergo a complete investigation every three years. If for any reason the license is terminated, the assets of the riverboat gaming operation cannot be disposed of without the approval of the Commission. In 2009, the Indiana General Assembly enacted legislation requiring all casino operators to submit for approval by the Commission a written power of attorney identifying a person who would serve as trustee to temporarily operate the casino in certain rare circumstances, such as the revocation or non-renewal of an owner’s license. Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC most recently had its power of attorney approved by the Commission in April 2011. 
A holder of a gaming license is required to post a bond with the Commission in an amount that the Commission determines will adequately reflect the amount that a local community will expend for infrastructure and other facilities associated with a riverboat operation. A licensee must hold insurance of the type and amount deemed necessary by the Commission.
The Commission has also promulgated a rule mandating that licensees maintain a cash reserve to protect patrons against defaults in gaming debts. The cash reserve is to be equal to a licensee’s average payout for a three-day period based on the riverboat’s performance during the prior calendar quarter. The cash reserve can consist of cash on hand, cash maintained in Indiana bank accounts and cash equivalents not otherwise committed or obligated.
The Indiana Act does not limit the maximum bet or per patron loss. Each licensee sets minimum and maximum wagers on its own games. Wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager, and wagers may only be taken from persons present on a licensed riverboat.
The Commission places special emphasis on the participation of minority business enterprises (“MBEs”) and women business enterprises (“WBEs”) in the riverboat industry. Each licensee is required to submit annually to the Commission a report that includes the total dollar value of contracts awarded for qualifying goods and services along with the percentage that was spent with MBEs and WBEs, respectively. Prior to 2008, the Commission set a 10% goal for MBEs and a 5% goal for WBEs. In 2007, the Commission conducted a disparity study entitled “A Disparity Study for the Indiana Gaming Commission, May 2007” (the “Disparity Study”) to determine whether a gap existed between the capacity of MBEs and WBEs and the utilization thereof by riverboat casinos in Indiana. The Disparity Study concluded that, with the exception of WBE purchases in the construction area, there was no statistically significant “disparity.” As a result, the Commission issued Resolution 2007-58 to mandate that, effective January 1, 2008, annual goals for expenditures to WBEs for the purchase of construction goods and services shall be set at 10.9%. In November 2010, relying on two years of expenditure data that indicated a statistically significant disparity, the Commission issued Resolution 2010-217 to mandate that, effective January 1, 2011, the annual goal for expenditures to MBEs for the purchase of construction goods and services shall be 23.2%. Failure to meet these goals will be scrutinized heavily by the Commission. The Indiana Act authorizes the Commission to suspend, limit or revoke an owner’s gaming license or impose a fine or other appropriate conditions for failure to comply with these guidelines. However, if a determination is made that a licensee has failed to demonstrate compliance with these guidelines, the licensee has 90 days from the date of the determination to comply. For expenditures in all areas where formal goals have not been established, the Commission has taken the position that the capacity percentages set forth in the Disparity Study for MBEs and WBEs, respectively, are targets for which best faith efforts of each licensee are expected.
A licensee may not lease, hypothecate, borrow money against or lend money against an owner’s riverboat gaming license. An ownership interest in an owner’s riverboat gaming license may only be transferred in accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Indiana Act.
The Indiana Act stipulates a graduated wagering tax with a starting tax rate of 15% and a top rate of 40% for adjusted gross receipts in excess of $600.0 million. In addition to the wagering tax, an admissions tax of $3 per admission is assessed. The Indiana Act provides for the suspension or revocation of a license if the wagering and admissions taxes are not timely submitted.
A licensee may enter into debt transactions that total $1.0 million or more only with the prior approval of the Commission. Such approval is subject to compliance with requisite procedures and a showing that each person with whom the licensee enters 
14
into a debt transaction would be suitable for licensure under the Indiana Act. Unless waived, approval of debt transactions requires consideration by the Commission at two business meetings. The Commission, by resolution, has authorized its Executive Director, subject to subsequent ratification by the Commission, to approve debt transactions after a review of the transaction documents and consultation with the Commission Chair and the Commission’s financial consultant(s).
The Commission may subject a licensee to fines, suspension or revocation of its license for any act that is in violation of the Indiana Act or the regulations of the Commission or for any other fraudulent act. In addition, the Commission may revoke an owner’s license if the Commission determines that the revocation of the license is in the best interests of the State of Indiana.
The Indiana Act provides that the sale of alcoholic beverages at riverboat casinos is subject to licensing, control and regulation pursuant to Title 7.1 of the Indiana Code and the rules adopted by the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission.
Mississippi
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission (the “Mississippi Commission”).
The Mississippi Gaming Control Act (the “Mississippi Act”) is similar to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. The Mississippi Commission has adopted regulations that are also similar in many respects to the Nevada gaming regulations.
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Mississippi Commission are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things, (1) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (3) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing for reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Mississippi Commission; (4) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; (5) providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and (6) ensuring that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Commission. We believe that our compliance with the licensing procedures and regulatory requirements of the Mississippi Commission will not affect the marketability of our securities. Changes in Mississippi laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations.
The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming in each of the 14 counties that border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if the voters in the county have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. Currently, gaming is permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the state and gaming operations take place in seven counties. Traditionally, Mississippi law required gaming vessels to be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River or in the waters lying south of the counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. However, the Mississippi legislature has amended the Mississippi Act to permit licensees in the three counties along the Gulf Coast to establish land-based casino operations provided that the gaming areas do not extend more than 800 feet beyond the 19-year mean high water line, except in Harrison County, where the limit can be extended as far as the greater of 800 feet beyond the 19-year mean water line or the southern boundary of Highway 90. Due to another change to the Mississippi Act, the Commission has also permitted licensees in approved river counties to conduct gaming operations on permanent structures, provided that the majority of any such structure is located on the river side of the “bank full” line of the Mississippi River.
The Mississippi Act permits unlimited stakes gaming on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the percentage of space that may be utilized for gaming. The Mississippi Act permits substantially all traditional casino games and gaming devices.
ACI and any subsidiary of ACI that operates a casino in Mississippi (a “Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary”) are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Commission. As the sole stockholder of Ameristar Casino Vicksburg, Inc. (“ACVI”), a licensee of the Mississippi Commission, ACI is registered under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded corporation (a “Registered Corporation”). As a Registered Corporation, we are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Mississippi Commission and furnish any other information that the Mississippi Commission may require. If we are unable to continue to satisfy the registration requirements of the Mississippi Act, we and any Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi. No person may become a stockholder of or receive any percentage of profits from a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Commission. We have obtained such approvals in connection with our ownership of ACVI.
A Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary must maintain a gaming license from the Mississippi Commission to operate a casino in Mississippi. Such licenses are issued by the Mississippi Commission subject to certain conditions, including continued compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses that may be 
15
issued in Mississippi. Gaming licenses require the payment of periodic fees and taxes, are not transferable, are issued for a three-year period and must be renewed periodically thereafter. ACVI most recently was granted a renewal of its gaming license by the Mississippi Commission on January 25, 2012. This license expires on January 24, 2015.
Certain of our officers and employees and the officers, directors and certain key employees of our Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary must be found suitable or approved by the Mississippi Commission. We believe that we have obtained, applied for or are in the process of applying for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to such persons affiliated with Ameristar or ACVI, although the Mississippi Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with Ameristar or ACVI may be required to be found suitable, in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with such investigation. The Mississippi Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that it deems reasonable. Changes in certain licensed positions, including changes in any person’s corporate position or title, must be reported to the Mississippi Commission. In addition to having authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability, the Mississippi Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in such person’s corporate position or title and such changes must be reported to the Mississippi Commission. The Mississippi Commission has the power to require us and any Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in such capacities. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Mississippi.
At any time, the Mississippi Commission has the power to investigate and require the finding of suitability of any record or beneficial stockholder of Ameristar. The Mississippi Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a Registered Corporation, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, to report the acquisition to the Mississippi Commission, and such person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a Registered Corporation, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi Commission and must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of beneficial owners.
The Mississippi Commission generally has exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of voting securities of a Registered Corporation. However, under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Mississippi Commission’s regulations, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 15% of the voting securities of a Registered Corporation may apply to the Mississippi Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Registered Corporation, any change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the Registered Corporation or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Mississippi Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes include (1) voting on all matters voted on by stockholders; (2) making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in the Registered Corporation’s management, policies or operations; and (3) such other activities as the Mississippi Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Commission may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner of our securities if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond such time as the Mississippi Commission prescribes may be guilty of a misdemeanor. We may be subject to disciplinary action if, after receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or any Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary owned by us, the company involved (1) pays the unsuitable person any dividend or other distribution upon such person’s voting securities; (2) recognizes the exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred by securities held by the unsuitable person; (3) pays the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in certain limited and specific circumstances; or (4) fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the securities for cash at fair market value.
We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Commission, upon request, the identities of the holders of our debt or other securities. In addition, under the Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Commission, in its discretion, may require the holder of any debt security of a Registered Corporation to file an application, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt security if the Mississippi Commission has reason to believe that the holder’s ownership of such debt securities would be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Mississippi.
16
Although the Mississippi Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found suitable, the Mississippi Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt instruments exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question. Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of suitability must pay all investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Commission in connection with such an investigation.
If the Mississippi Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own a debt security, then the Registered Corporation may be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission it (1) pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or any distribution whatsoever; (2) recognizes any voting right by the unsuitable person in connection with those securities; (3) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or (4) makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.
Each Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of its equity securities and we must maintain in Mississippi a current list of our stockholders, which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any class of our equity securities. The ledger and stockholder lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Commission at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Mississippi Commission. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner.
The Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a Registered Corporation bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Commission. We have received from the Mississippi Commission a waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on the holders of our securities at any time.
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by a Registered Corporation or a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary must be reported to or approved by the Mississippi Commission. A Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary may not make a public offering of its securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities. A Registered Corporation may not make a public offering of its securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. We have received a waiver of the prior approval requirement with respect to public offerings and private placements of securities, subject to certain conditions, including the ability of the Mississippi Commission to issue a stop order with respect to any such offering if the staff determines it would be necessary to do so.
Under the regulations of the Mississippi Commission, a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary may not guarantee a security issued by an affiliated company pursuant to a public offering, or pledge its assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by a security issued by an affiliated company, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission. A pledge of the stock of a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary and the foreclosure of such a pledge are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary or its holding companies and agreements not to encumber such securities are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission. We have obtained approvals from the Mississippi Commission for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions in connection with offerings of securities, subject to certain restrictions, but we must obtain separate prior approvals from the Mississippi Commission for pledges and stock restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions. Moreover, the regulations of the Mississippi Commission require us to file a Loan to Licensees Report within 30 days following certain financing transactions and the offering of certain debt securities. If the Mississippi Commission were to deem it appropriate, the Mississippi Commission could order any such transaction rescinded.
Changes in control of the Company through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any act or conduct by a person by which he or she obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Mississippi Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Registered Corporation must satisfy the Mississippi Commission in a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of the Registered Corporation. The Mississippi Commission also may require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and found suitable as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
The Mississippi legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defense tactics that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and Registered Corporations may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to (1) assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates; (2) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and (3) promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.
17
Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Mississippi Commission before a Registered Corporation may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities (such as repurchases which treat holders differently) in excess of the current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. Mississippi’s gaming regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Commission of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the Registered Corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the Registered Corporation’s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the Registered Corporation.
Neither we nor any Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while also conducting gaming operations outside of Mississippi without approval of, or a waiver of such approval by, the Mississippi Commission. The Mississippi Commission may require determinations that, among other things, there are means for the Mississippi Commission to have access to information concerning the out-of-state gaming operations of us and our affiliates. We previously have obtained, or otherwise qualified for, a waiver of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Commission for operations in other jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations and will be required to obtain the approval or a waiver of such approval from the Mississippi Commission prior to engaging in any additional future gaming operations outside of Mississippi; provided, however, that such waiver shall be automatically granted under the Mississippi Commission’s regulations in connection with foreign gaming activities (except for internet gaming activities) conducted (1) within the 50 states or any territory of the United States, (2) on board any cruise ship embarking from a port located therein or (3) in any other jurisdiction in which a casino operator’s license or its equivalent is not required in order to legally conduct gaming operations.
If the Mississippi Commission were to determine that we or ACVI had violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Commission could limit, condition, suspend or revoke our approvals and the license of ACVI, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures. In addition, we, ACVI and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation. Because of such a violation, the Mississippi Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or approval or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming license or approval would) materially adversely affect us, our gaming operations and our results of operations.
License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi Commission and the counties and cities in which a Mississippi Gaming Subsidiary’s operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly or annually. Generally, gaming fees and taxes are based upon the following: (1) a percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operation; (2) the number of gaming devices operated by the casino; or (3) the number of table games operated by the casino.
The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gaming receipts” (generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to guests as winnings) and the current maximum tax rate imposed is 8% of all gaming receipts in excess of $134,000 per month. The foregoing license fees we pay are allowed as a credit against ACVI’s Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. The gross revenues fee imposed by the City of Vicksburg equals approximately 4% of gaming receipts.
The Mississippi Commission’s regulations require as a condition of licensure or license renewal that an existing licensed gaming establishment’s plan include adequate parking facilities in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities, such as hotels, which amount to at least 100% of the casino cost. The Mississippi Commission’s current infrastructure requirement applies to new casinos or acquisitions of closed casinos. Ameristar Vicksburg was grandfathered under a prior version of that regulation that required that the infrastructure investment be equal to only 25% or more of the casino cost.
The sale of alcoholic beverages at Ameristar Vicksburg is subject to licensing, control and regulation by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi State Tax Commission (the “ABC”) and by the City of Vicksburg. Ameristar Vicksburg is located in a designated special resort area, which allows ACVI to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis. If ABC regulations are violated, the ABC has the power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the serving of alcoholic beverages or to place such licensee on probation with or without conditions. Certain officers and managers of ACVI must be investigated by the ABC in connection with ACVI’s liquor permit and changes in certain key positions must be approved by the ABC.
Colorado
As prescribed by the Colorado Limited Gaming Act of 1991 (the “Colorado Act”), the ownership and operation of limited stakes gaming facilities in Colorado are subject to the Colorado Gaming Regulations (the “Colorado Regulations”) and final authority of the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission (the “Colorado Commission”). The Colorado Act also created the Colorado Division of Gaming within the Colorado Department of Revenue to license, supervise and enforce the conduct of limited stakes gaming in Colorado.
Ameristar Casino Black Hawk, Inc. (“ACBHI”) holds operator, retail gaming and manufacturer/distributor licenses for Ameristar Casino Black Hawk issued by the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Act requires that applications for renewal of 
18
operator, retail gaming and manufacturer/distributor licenses be filed every two years with the Commission not less than 120 days prior to the expiration of the current licenses. ACBHI’s current licenses expire on December 16, 2013.
The Colorado Act declares public policy on limited stakes gaming to be that: (1) the success of limited stakes gaming is dependent upon public confidence and trust that licensed limited stakes gaming is conducted honestly and competitively, the rights of the creditors of licensees are protected and gaming is free from criminal and corruptive elements; (2) public confidence and trust can be maintained only by strict regulation of all persons, locations, practices, associations and activities related to the operation of licensed gaming establishments and the manufacture or distribution of gaming devices and equipment; (3) all establishments where limited gaming is conducted and where gambling devices are operated, and all manufacturers, sellers and distributors of certain gambling devices and equipment, must therefore be licensed, controlled and assisted to protect the public health, safety, good order and the general welfare of the inhabitants of the state to foster the stability and success of limited stakes gaming and to preserve the economy, policies and free competition in Colorado; and (4) no applicant for a license or other affirmative Colorado Commission approval has any right to a license or to the granting of the approval sought. Having the authority to impose fines, the Colorado Commission has broad discretion to issue, condition, suspend for up to six months, revoke, limit or restrict at any time the following licenses: slot machine manufacturer or distributor, operator, retail gaming, support and key employee gaming licenses. With limited exceptions applicable to licensees that are publicly traded entities, no person may sell, lease, purchase, convey or acquire any interest in a retail gaming or operator license or business without the prior approval of the Colorado Commission. Any license issued or other Colorado Commission approval granted pursuant to the Colorado Act is a revocable privilege, and no holder acquires any vested rights therein.
Pursuant to an amendment to the Colorado Constitution (the “Colorado Amendment”), limited stakes gaming became lawful in the cities of Central City, Black Hawk and Cripple Creek on October 1, 1991. Currently, limited stakes gaming means a maximum single bet of $100 on slot machines and in the games of blackjack, poker, craps and roulette. Gaming is permitted to be conducted 24 hours each day.
Limited stakes gaming is confined to the commercial districts of these cities as defined by Central City on October 7, 1981, by Black Hawk on May 4, 1978, and by Cripple Creek on December 3, 1973. In addition, the Colorado Amendment restricts limited stakes gaming to structures that conform to the architectural styles and designs that were common to the areas prior to World War I and that conform to the requirements of applicable city ordinances regardless of the age of the structures. Under the Colorado Amendment, no more than 35% of the square footage of any building and no more than 50% of any one floor of any building may be used for limited stakes gaming. Persons under the age of 21 cannot participate in limited stakes gaming.
The Colorado Constitution provides for a tax on the total amount wagered less all payouts to players at the following annual rates. The gaming tax rates in effect as of July 1, 2008 can only be increased by amendment to the Colorado Constitution by voters in a statewide election. With respect to games of poker, the tax is calculated based on the sums wagered that are retained by the licensee as compensation, which must be consistent with the minimum and maximum amounts established by the Colorado Commission. In May 2011, the Commission reduced the gaming tax rates to the following:
•
0.24% up to and including $2 million of the subject amounts;
•
1.9% on amounts from $2 million to $5 million;
•
8.55% on amounts from $5 million to $8 million;
•
10.45% on amounts from $8 million to $10 million;
•
15.2% on amounts from $10 million to $13 million; and
•
19% on amounts over $13 million.
The City of Black Hawk also assesses two monthly device fees that are based on the number of gaming devices operated. Those consist of a $62.50 fee per device and a transportation device fee of $6.42 per device.
The Colorado Commission has enacted Rule 4.5, which imposes requirements on publicly traded corporations holding gaming licenses in Colorado and on gaming licenses owned directly or indirectly by a publicly traded corporation, whether through a subsidiary or intermediary company. The term “publicly traded corporation” includes corporations, firms, limited liability companies, trusts, partnerships and other forms of business organizations. Such requirements automatically apply to any ownership interest held by a publicly traded corporation, holding company or intermediary company thereof, where the ownership interest directly or indirectly is, or will be upon approval of the Colorado Commission, 5% or more of the entire licensee. In any event, if the Colorado Commission determines that a publicly traded corporation or a subsidiary, intermediary company or holding company has the actual ability to exercise influence over a licensee, regardless of the percentage of ownership possessed by such entity, the Colorado Commission may require the entity to comply with the disclosure regulations contained in Rule 4.5.
Under Rule 4.5, gaming licensees, affiliated companies and controlling persons commencing a public offering of voting 
19
securities must notify the Colorado Commission no later than 10 business days after the initial filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Licensed publicly traded corporations are also required to send proxy statements to the Division of Gaming within five days after their distribution. Licensees to whom Rule 4.5 applies must include in their charter documents provisions that restrict the rights of the licensees to issue voting interests or securities except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; limit the rights of persons to transfer voting interests or securities of licensees except in accordance with the Colorado Act and the Colorado Regulations; and provide that holders of voting interests or securities of licensees found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission may, within 60 days of such finding of unsuitability, be required to sell their interests or securities back to the issuer at the lesser of the cash equivalent of the holders’ investment or the market price as of the date of the finding of unsuitability. Alternatively, the holders may, within 60 days after the finding of unsuitability, transfer the voting interests or securities to a suitable person, as determined by the Colorado Commission. Until the voting interests or securities are held by suitable persons, the issuer may not pay dividends or interest, the securities may not be voted and may not be included in the voting or securities of the issuer, and the issuer may not pay any remuneration in any form to the holders of the securities.
Pursuant to Rule 4.5, persons who acquire direct or indirect beneficial ownership of (a) 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly traded corporation that is required to include in its articles of incorporation the Rule 4.5 charter language provisions; or (b) 5% or more of the beneficial interest in a gaming licensee directly or indirectly through any class of voting securities of any holding company or intermediary company of a licensee, referred to as “qualifying persons,” shall notify the Division of Gaming within 10 days of such acquisition, are required to submit all requested information and are subject to a finding of suitability as required by the Division of Gaming or the Colorado Commission. Licensees also must notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. A qualifying person other than an institutional investor whose interest equals 10% or more must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such securities. Licensees must also notify any qualifying persons of these requirements. Whether or not notified, qualifying persons are responsible for complying with these requirements.
A qualifying person who is an institutional investor under Rule 4.5 and who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of any class of voting securities must apply to the Colorado Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring such interests.
The Colorado Regulations provide for exemption from the requirements for a finding of suitability when the Colorado Commission finds such action to be consistent with the purposes of the Colorado Act.
Pursuant to Rule 4.5, persons found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission must be removed from any position as an officer, director or employee of a licensee, or from a holding or intermediary company. Such unsuitable persons also are prohibited from any beneficial ownership of the voting securities of any such entities. Licensees, or affiliated entities of licensees, are subject to sanctions for paying dividends or distributions to persons found unsuitable by the Colorado Commission, or for recognizing voting rights of, or paying a salary or any remuneration for services to, unsuitable persons. Licensees or their affiliated entities also may be sanctioned for failing to pursue efforts to require unsuitable persons to relinquish their interest. The Colorado Commission may determine that anyone with a material relationship to, or material involvement with, a licensee or an affiliated company must apply for a finding of suitability or must apply for a key employee license.
The Colorado Regulations require that every officer, director and stockholder of private corporations or equivalent office or ownership holders for non-corporate applicants, and every officer, director or stockholder holding either a 5% or greater interest or controlling interest of a publicly traded corporation or owners of an applicant or licensee, shall be a person of good moral character and submit to a full background investigation conducted by the Division of Gaming and the Colorado Commission. The Colorado Commission may require any person having an interest in a license to undergo a full background investigation and pay the cost of investigation in the same manner as an applicant.
The sale of alcoholic beverages in gaming establishments is subject to strict licensing, control and regulation by State and local authorities. Alcoholic beverage licenses are revocable and nontransferable. State and local licensing authorities have full power to limit, condition, suspend for as long as six months or revoke any such licenses.
There are various classes of retail liquor licenses which may be issued under the Colorado Liquor Code. A gaming licensee may sell malt, vinous or spirituous liquors only by the individual drink for consumption on the premises. An application for an alcoholic beverage license in Colorado requires notice, posting and a public hearing before the local liquor licensing authority prior to approval. The Colorado Department of Revenue’s Liquor Enforcement Division must also approve the application. ACBHI has been approved for a hotel and restaurant liquor license by both the local Black Hawk licensing authority and the State Division of Liquor Enforcement.
Nevada
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Nevada are subject to: (1) the Nevada Gaming Control Act 
20
and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “Nevada Act”); and (2) various local regulations. Our operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Commission (“Nevada Commission”), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (“Nevada Board”), and the Liquor Board of Elko County. The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board and the Liquor Board of Elko County are collectively referred to in this section as the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy which are concerned with, among other things, (1) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) the establishment and maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; (3) providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; (4) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and (5) providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. Change in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on our gaming operations.
Cactus Pete’s, Inc. (“CPI”), which owns and operates the Jackpot properties, is required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The gaming licenses require the periodic payment of fees and taxes and are not transferable. Ameristar is registered by the Nevada Commission as a publicly traded corporation (a “Registered Corporation”) and has been found suitable to own the stock of CPI, which is a corporate licensee (a “Corporate Licensee”) under the terms of the Nevada Act. As a Registered Corporation, Ameristar is required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require. No person may become a holder of 5% or less of the stock of a Corporate Licensee without registering with the Nevada Gaming Authorities. No person may become a holder of more than 5% of the stock of, or receive any percentage of profits from, a Corporate Licensee without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Ameristar and CPI have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, findings of suitability, approvals, permits and licenses currently required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.
The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, CPI or Ameristar in order to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Officers, directors and certain key employees of CPI must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Officers, directors and key employees of Ameristar who are actively and directly involved in gaming activities of CPI may be required to be reviewed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause that they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant for licensing or a finding of suitability must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with CPI or Ameristar, the companies involved would have to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require CPI or Ameristar to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.
CPI and Ameristar are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission. Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by Ameristar and CPI must be reported to, or approved by, the Nevada Commission.
If it were determined that the Nevada Act was violated by CPI, the gaming licenses it holds or has applied for could be limited, denied, conditioned, suspended or revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures. In addition, CPI, Ameristar and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate CPI’s gaming properties and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the premises) could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and denial or revocation of any gaming license would) materially adversely affect our gaming operations.
Any beneficial holder of Ameristar’s voting or non-voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated and have his suitability as a beneficial holder of Ameristar’s voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policy of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such investigation.
21
The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than 5% of a Registered Corporation’s voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission. The Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of a Registered Corporation’s voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. However, an “institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada Act, which beneficially owns more than 10% but not more than 11% of a Registered Company’s voting securities as a result of a stock repurchase by the Registered Company may not be required to file such an application. Further, an institutional investor which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25%, of a Registered Corporation’s voting securities may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may hold more than 25% but not more than 29% of a Registered Corporation’s voting securities and maintain its waiver where the additional ownership results from a stock repurchase by the Registered Corporation. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the Registered Corporation, any change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the Registered Corporation or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the Registered Corporation’s voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities which are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include (1) voting on all matters voted on by stockholders; (2) making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in its management, policies or operations; and (3) such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. If the beneficial holder of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.
Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the Chairman of the Nevada Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any equity security holder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the equity securities of a Registered Corporation beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. Ameristar is subject to disciplinary action if, after it receives notice that a person is unsuitable to be a security holder or to have any other relationship with Ameristar or CPI, Ameristar (1) pays that person any dividend or interest upon voting securities of Ameristar, (2) allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by the person, (3) pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise, or (4) fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of such securities by Ameristar for cash at fair market value. Additionally, the Liquor Board of Elko County has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming license within its jurisdiction.
The Nevada Commission may, at its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of a Registered Corporation to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt security of a Registered Corporation if it has reason to believe that such holder’s acquisition of such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policy of the State of Nevada. If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act, the Registered Corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it (1) pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; (2) recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities; (3) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or (4) makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction.
Ameristar is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada, which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Ameristar is also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require Ameristar stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on Ameristar.
Ameristar may not make a public offering of its securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for such purposes. On March 24, 2011, the Nevada Commission granted us approval to make public offerings for a period of two years, subject to specified conditions (the “Shelf Approval”). The Shelf Approval also applies to any company we wholly own that is a publicly traded corporation or would become a publicly traded corporation pursuant to a public offering (“Affiliate”). The Shelf Approval also includes approval for CPI to guarantee any security issued by, and to 
22
hypothecate its assets to secure the payment or performance of any obligations evidenced by a security issued by, us or an Affiliate in a public offering. The Shelf Approval also includes approval to place restrictions upon the transfer of, and enter into agreements not to encumber the equity securities of, CPI. The Shelf Approval, however, may be rescinded for good cause, without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the investment merits of the securities offered. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.
Changes in control of Ameristar through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby he obtains control may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Registered Corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and Nevada Commission in a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of such Registered Corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada Corporate Licensees, and Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to (1) assure the financial stability of Corporate Licensees and their affiliates; (2) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and (3) promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before the Registered Corporation can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the current market price thereof and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by the Registered Corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the Registered Corporation’s stockholders for the purposes of acquiring control of the Registered Corporation.
Ameristar has adopted and maintains a Gaming Compliance Program (“Program”) that has been approved by the Chairman of the Nevada Board. The Program is designed to assist our efforts to maintain compliance with the gaming laws of the various jurisdictions under which we conduct our gaming operations. Under the Program, a Compliance Committee, assisted by a Compliance Officer, conducts reviews of specified types of proposed business and employment transactions and relationships and other matters related to regulatory requirements, and advises the Board of Directors and management accordingly. The Compliance Committee’s activities are designed primarily to help assure the suitability of business associations of the Company and its affiliates.
License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to the counties and cities in which the Nevada licensee’s respective operations are conducted. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon: (1) a percentage of the gross revenues received; (2) the number of gaming devices operated; or (3) the number of table games operated. A live entertainment tax is also paid by certain casino operations where entertainment is furnished in connection with admission fees, the selling or serving of food and refreshments, or the selling of merchandise.
Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered or is under common control with such persons (collectively, “Licensees”), and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation of the Nevada Board of their participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, Licensees are required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if they knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage in activities or enter into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees or employ, contract with or associate with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.
Other Jurisdictions
We expect to be subject to rigorous regulatory standards, which may or may not be similar to the foregoing standards, in each jurisdiction in which we may seek to conduct gaming operations in the future. There can be no assurance that statutes or regulations adopted or fees and taxes imposed by other jurisdictions will permit us to operate profitably.
Federal Regulation of Slot Machines
We are required to make annual filings with the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the sale, distribution or 
23
operation of slot machines. All requisite filings for the current year have been made.
Other Regulations
Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to those discussed above. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, those concerning employees, taxation, zoning and building codes, environmental protection, maritime operations, marketing and advertising, currency transaction reporting and the extension and collection of credit. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.
Our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by the weak economic conditions currently being experienced in the United States, as we are highly dependent on discretionary spending by our guests. We are not able to predict the length or severity of the current economic climate. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as increased or continuing high unemployment, significant increases in energy and automobile fuel prices, perceived or actual deterioration in general economic conditions, the protracted disruption in the housing markets, the availability of credit, perceived or actual decline in disposable consumer income and wealth (including declines resulting from any increase in personal income tax rates) and changes in consumer confidence in the economy may continue to reduce customer demand for the leisure activities we offer and adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.
We have substantial debt and may incur additional debt; leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations.
We currently have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2011, our total consolidated debt, including discount, was $1.93 billion. Under generally accepted accounting principles, our total liabilities exceed our total assets.
Subject to specified limitations, the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in 2011 permits us to incur substantial additional debt. In addition, as of December 31, 2011, our senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to an additional $257.0 million as revolving loans (after giving effect to the outstanding letters of credit). Our substantial debt and any additional debt we may incur to expand our business or otherwise could have important consequences to our business, including:
•
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions;
•
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and general corporate requirements;
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
•
exposing our cash flows to changes in floating rates of interest such that an increase in floating rates would negatively impact our cash flows; and
•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.
The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations.
24
Servicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.
Our ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and to fund capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash flow in the future. To some extent, our ability to generate future cash flow is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facility in the future will depend on our satisfying the financial covenants in the agreement governing the facility. We cannot assure that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund other liquidity needs. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our debt on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Covenant restrictions under our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes may limit our ability to operate our business.
The agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in 2011 contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, borrow money, pay dividends, make capital expenditures and effect a consolidation, merger or disposal of all or substantially all of our assets. Although the covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture are subject to various exceptions, we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest. In addition, our long-term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our senior credit facility and the indenture. If an event of default under our senior credit facility occurs, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, our senior credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of our real and personal property, including the capital stock of our subsidiaries. If we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default, the lenders could foreclose on these assets.
The gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations.
The gaming industry is very competitive, and we face dynamic competitive pressures in our markets. Several of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and other resources. We may choose or be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses.
Our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations. These restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain guests. The legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could result in a significant increase in competition and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic difficulties faced by state governments, as well as the increased acceptance of gaming as a leisure activity, could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming.
In 2007, the Kansas legislature enacted a law that authorizes up to four state-owned and operated freestanding casinos and three racetrack slot machine parlors developed and managed by third parties. At that time, one casino and one racetrack location were authorized in Wyandotte County in the greater Kansas City market. The owner of the potential racetrack slot machine parlor license surrendered its racing license and closed the facility due to concerns about the tax rate that would apply to its gaming operations, which was substantially higher than the tax rate in Missouri or applicable to Kansas freestanding casinos. The future status of the racetrack license is uncertain; however, there have been discussions about reducing the tax rate in order to incentivize the installation of slot machines at the racetracks. On February 3, 2012, a partnership that includes a major commercial casino operator opened the first phase of a large land-based casino and entertainment facility at the Kansas Speedway, approximately 24 miles from Ameristar Kansas City. This facility will provide significant additional competition for the Kansas City market and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of Ameristar Kansas City.
Our East Chicago property currently competes with eight other casino gaming facilities in the Chicagoland market in Indiana and Illinois and with one Native American casino in Michigan. One of our property’s principal competitors is located in Hammond, Indiana, which is closer to and has significantly better access for customers who live in Chicago, Illinois and the Chicago suburbs that are the primary feeder markets for Ameristar East Chicago. In 2008, the Hammond facility opened a $485 million expansion that has adversely affected our property’s business, particularly table games and poker, and we expect will continue to do so.
The tenth and final Illinois casino license was awarded to a developer for a property in Des Plaines, Illinois, located approximately 40 miles from Ameristar East Chicago. That facility opened in July 2011 and has resulted in increased competition for Ameristar East Chicago. From time to time, the Illinois legislature has also considered other forms of gaming expansion in the 
25
state. The most recent was a bill that was passed by the legislature in 2011 but not signed into law by the governor. It would have authorized a large-scale expansion of casino gaming in Chicago and throughout the state. It is likely that a similar effort will be made again in the future. If Illinois materially expands gaming, particularly in downtown Chicago or the south Chicago suburbs, the additional competition would materially adversely affect the financial performance of Ameristar East Chicago. The expansion of gaming in southern Illinois would also have an adverse effect on Ameristar St. Charles.
Over the years, several attempts have been made in the Indiana legislature to allow one of the two adjacent riverboat casino licenses held by the same operator in Gary, Indiana, approximately five miles from Ameristar East Chicago, to be moved to a nearby land-based location. None of the efforts has been successful, but it is possible such a measure will be introduced in the future. If a casino is allowed to relocate inland to a more accessible location, it could materially adversely affect the financial performance of Ameristar East Chicago.
In 2007, a competitor opened a new casino in downtown St. Louis, approximately 22 miles from Ameristar St. Charles, and in 2010 the same competitor opened an additional casino facility in southeastern St. Louis County, approximately 30 miles from Ameristar St. Charles. The new facilities have resulted in significant additional competition for Ameristar St. Charles that has adversely impacted its business. In September 2011, the competitor announced a planned expansion of the southeastern St. Louis County facility to include a 200-room hotel, an event center and a parking garage. The expansion is slated for completion in late 2013. In addition, if legislation is enacted in Illinois to permit the operation of slot machines at racetracks, Ameristar St. Charles would face additional competition from the racetrack near downtown St. Louis.
Over the years, several attempts have been made in the Colorado legislature to authorize video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) within the state. VLTs are very similar in appearance and performance to casino slot machines. A bill to authorize VLTs has been introduced this year as well. If VLTs are authorized in Colorado, they would represent additional competition for Ameristar Black Hawk and could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the property.
Recently, the operator of a casino in Reno, Nevada agreed to purchase one of Ameristar Black Hawk
’
s larger competitors in the market, which has been operating in bankruptcy. It is possible that the facility will become more competitive following the closing of the purchase.
Several attempts have been made in the Nebraska legislature to expand gaming in the state. None of those efforts has been successful. If casino gaming is authorized in the Omaha area, it could have a material adverse impact on Ameristar Council Bluffs
’ 
business.
Native American gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state-licensed casinos, which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets. In December 2007, the National Indian Gaming Commission (the “NIGC”) approved the request of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska to have a five-acre parcel owned by the tribe in Carter Lake, Iowa, located approximately five miles from Ameristar Council Bluffs, approved for the operation of gaming. In December 2008, in a lawsuit brought by the State of Nebraska and joined by the State of Iowa and the City of Council Bluffs, the federal district court reversed the NIGC’s decision. The U.S. Department of the Interior appealed the district court ruling, and in October 2010 the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court’s decision and ordered the court to remand the matter to the NIGC for further consideration. The Court of Appeals directed the NIGC to revisit the issue, taking into consideration, among other things, a 2003 agreement between the State of Iowa and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. That agreement stated that the five-acre parcel would be utilized for a health center and not for gaming purposes. If the tribe is allowed to conduct gaming at this location, the additional competition would adversely affect our Council Bluffs business. The NIGC has yet to publicly render a decision on this matter.
The entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location. Furthermore, increases in the popularity of, and competition from, Internet and other account wagering and gaming services, which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of Internet gaming in the United States.
Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking.
Legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has recently been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Effective January 1, 2008, a Colorado smoking ban was extended to include casino floors. We believe this ban has significantly negatively impacted business volumes in all Colorado gaming markets. In April 2008, voters in the City of Kansas City approved a ballot measure, which was subsequently modified by the City Council, that prohibits smoking in most indoor public places within the City, including restaurants, but which contains an exemption for casino floors and 20% of all hotel rooms. One of Ameristar Kansas City’s competitors is not subject to 
26
a smoking ban in any form, which we believe has had some negative impact on our business. On July 1, 2008, a statewide indoor smoking ban went into effect in the State of Iowa. The law includes an exemption for casino floors and 20% of all hotel rooms. From time to time, bills have been introduced in the Iowa legislature that would eliminate the casino floor exemption. Nevada has a statewide indoor smoking ban, with exemptions for the gaming areas of casinos and bars where prepared food is not served. In January 2012, a statewide indoor smoking ban was passed by the Indiana House that provides an exemption for the entire footprint of casino properties. It is not yet certain if this bill will become law and, if so, whether the casino exemption will remain in the bill. Similar bills have been introduced from time to time in the Missouri legislature and the St. Charles County Council. If additional restrictions on smoking are enacted in jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly if such restrictions are applicable to casino floors, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.
State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn and budget deficits, such as are currently being experienced in most states, may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors (such as the elimination of the buy-in limit in Missouri that became effective in 2008), our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Effective July 1, 2011, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission reduced all gaming tax rate tiers by 5%, which resulted in a reduction of the top rate tier from 20% to 19%. The Commission has announced that it plans to reconsider the tax reduction in the spring of 2012, and we believe it is likely that the highest rate tier will be restored to 20%, effective July 1, 2012. 
Several measures have been introduced in the current session of the Missouri legislature that would raise the casino admission tax. The proceeds would benefit the state’s veterans’ services. If any of the measures is enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles.
We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates.
All of our outstanding debt under our senior credit facility bears interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.13 billion outstanding under our senior credit facility, including discount. If short-term interest rates rise from current levels, our interest cost would increase, which would adversely affect our net income and available cash.
Our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us.
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation. The states of Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Mississippi, Colorado and Nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries. The Missouri Gaming Commission, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission and the Nevada Gaming Commission may, among other things, limit, condition, suspend, revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Mississippi, Colorado or Nevada subsidiaries, respectively, for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority. Our gaming licenses in Missouri and Colorado must be renewed every two years, our gaming licenses in Iowa and Indiana must be renewed every year and our gaming license in Mississippi must be renewed every three years. If we violate gaming laws or regulations, substantial fines could be levied against us, our subsidiaries and the persons involved, and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets. The suspension, revocation or non-renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, findings of suitability, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities. However, gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under the laws of all the jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot assure you that our existing licenses, permits and approvals will be maintained or extended. We also cannot assure you that any new licenses, permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us.
Holders of our common stock may be subject to gaming regulatory requirements or could be forced to sell their shares.
All of the jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities have regulations requiring owners of more than a specified percentage of our outstanding stock to notify gaming regulatory authorities, provide information or certifications to those authorities and, in some cases, apply for a finding of suitability or license. The threshold level of ownership for such requirements in some jurisdictions is as low as 5% of our outstanding common stock, although exceptions or reduced requirements may be applicable for timely submissions by holders who generally qualify as “institutional investors” as defined in that jurisdiction and own not 
27
more than 10% of our stock. The specific qualifications vary by jurisdiction, but the lack of intent to exercise control over the company or its operations, by itself, is not a sufficient basis for exception or reduced requirements in some jurisdictions. For more information, see “Item 1. Business — Government Regulation.”
Owners of sufficient percentages of our common stock who do not or cannot comply with these requirements may be compelled to dispose of their common stock quickly and at a time at which they do not desire to do so. Any such sales by a significant holder of common stock, and the regulatory disincentives to acquire significant ownership positions, could affect the trading price of our common stock.
Adverse weather conditions or natural disasters in the areas in which we operate, or other conditions that restrict access to our properties, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Adverse weather conditions, particularly flooding, heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions, as well as natural disasters, can deter our guests from traveling or make it difficult for them to visit our properties. If any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions, or if multiple properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. Our business may also be adversely affected by other events or conditions that restrict access to our properties, such as road closures.
In December 2009, the Indiana Department of Transportation (“INDOT”) announced that it was permanently closing the Cline Avenue bridge near Ameristar East Chicago due to safety concerns discovered during an inspection of the bridge. The closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient, relative to our competitors, for many of Ameristar East Chicago’s guests and has significantly impacted the property’s financial results. We expect this to continue unless and until improved access is developed. Recently, INDOT has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road. There can be no assurance that this will occur or, if it does, as to how the imposition of tolls may affect visitation to Ameristar East Chicago. If the bridge is not rebuilt, area surface streets are expected to be improved by INDOT.
In Black Hawk, a project to widen a mile-long stretch of State Route 119 near Ameristar Black Hawk to four lanes began in late 2010 and is expected to last until August 2012. This project has created some inconvenience for guests of Ameristar Black Hawk and may continue to adversely affect its business levels while it is ongoing.
In November 2011, the Missouri Department of Transportation awarded a contract for a major renovation of the westbound span of the Blanchette Bridge, which carries Interstate 70 over the Missouri River near Ameristar St. Charles. During the project, the westbound span of the bridge will be closed for up to one year and westbound traffic will be diverted to the eastbound span, which will carry three lanes in each direction, compared to the current five lanes in each direction. Preliminary work has begun to prepare for the bridge closure, with lanes and highway ramps closed intermittently for brief intervals. The timing of the bridge closure has not yet been announced, but it is not expected to begin prior to November 2012. The project will create an inconvenience for guests of Ameristar St. Charles and we expect it will materially adversely affect its business levels while it is ongoing.
We have limited insurance coverage for earthquake damage at our properties. Several of our properties, particularly Ameristar St. Charles, are located near historically active earthquake faults. In the event one of our properties were to sustain significant damage from an earthquake, our business could be materially adversely affected.
We have limited opportunities to develop or acquire new properties.
The casino gaming industry has limited new development opportunities. Most jurisdictions in which casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations, such as pari-mutuel racetracks. Moreover, it is not clear whether the tax, land use planning and regulatory structures that may be applicable to any new gaming opportunity would make the development and operation of a casino financially attractive to us. We expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise, including the gaming license that we intend to apply for in western Massachusetts, and many of the companies competing for such opportunities will have greater resources and name recognition than we do. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our business through new development or acquisitions. Futhermore, there can be no assurance that any future development or acquisitions that we may pursue will be profitable.
The continued payment of dividends on our stock is dependent on a number of factors and is not assured.
Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The payment of future dividends will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements and other factors, including our debt leverage. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that future dividends will be paid at levels comparable to our historical distributions, if at all. In addition, our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes issued in 2011 impose limitations on the amount of dividends we may pay.
28
Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned.
General Construction Risks — Delays and Cost Overruns.
  Construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks. These risks include: (1) shortages of materials (including slot machines or other gaming equipment); (2) shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; (3) unforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; (4) weather interference, floods, hurricanes, fires or other casualty losses; (5) unanticipated cost increases; (6) delays or increased costs in obtaining required governmental permits and approvals; and (7) construction period disruption to existing operations.
Our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets, conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects, consultants and contractors. The cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations, and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project. If we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis, the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available. The completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction-related or other reasons. We cannot assure you that any project will be completed on time, if at all, or within established budgets. Significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
From time to time, we may employ “fast-track” design and construction methods in our construction and development projects. This involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier stages of construction are underway. Although we believe the use of fast-track design and construction methods may reduce the overall construction time, these methods may not always result in such reductions, often involve greater construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Construction Dependent upon Available Financing and Cash Flows from Operations.
  The availability of funds under our senior credit facility at any time is dependent upon, among other factors, the amount of our Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the senior credit facility agreement, during the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. Our future operating performance will be subject to financial, economic, business, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our future consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete future construction projects.
As a result of operating risks, including those described in this section, and other risks associated with a new venture, we cannot assure you that, once completed, any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows.
Our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate, including hotels, are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism. An act of terrorism affecting one of our properties, whether or not covered by insurance, or otherwise affecting the gaming, travel or tourism industry in the United States, may have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts.
Our business may be adversely affected by our ability to retain and attract key personnel.
We depend on the continued performance of our entire senior management team. If we lose the services of any of our key executives or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner, it could have an adverse effect on our business.
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from numerous Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, we have a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
As we recruit personnel, we expect successful candidates to exhibit a collaborative, communicative and collegial nature. We also employ a high degree of centralization in a generally highly decentralized industry. These factors create risk in attracting management personnel in a timely fashion, as well as hiring candidates we expect to be successful within our Company.
29
The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on us.
A substantial majority of our revenues is attributable to slot machines operated by us at our casinos. It is important that, for competitive reasons, we offer the most popular and up-to-date slot machine games with the latest technology to our guests.
In recent years, the prices of new slot machines with additional features have escalated faster than the general rate of inflation. Furthermore, in recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participation lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participation lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.
For competitive reasons, we may choose to purchase new slot machines or enter into participation lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenues to offset the increased investment and participation lease costs, it could hurt our profitability.
We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.
Any loss from service of our operating facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us.
Our operating facilities could be lost from service due to casualty, mechanical failure, extended or extraordinary maintenance, floods or other severe weather conditions. Our riverboat and barge facilities are especially exposed to these risks and the changes in water levels.
The Ameristar Vicksburg site has experienced ongoing geologic instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements. Although we have reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel is drydocked on a concrete foundation, further reinforcements may be necessary. We are also monitoring the site and expect that further steps will be necessary to stabilize the site in order to permit operations to continue. A site failure would require Ameristar Vicksburg to limit or cease operations.
The loss of an operating facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility in an amount that we are unable to reasonably accurately estimate. It could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our senior credit facility.
A change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations.
Certain changes in control of Ameristar could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facility and the obligation to offer to repurchase our senior unsecured notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to repay or refinance any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control, and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition.
We are subject to non-gaming regulation.
We are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations. However, certain of our properties are located in industrial areas or were used for industrial purposes for many years. As a consequence, it is possible that historical or neighboring activities have affected one or more of our properties and that, as a result, environmental issues could arise in the future, the precise nature of which we cannot now predict. We do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events, and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions. In addition, if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our properties, we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities.
Regulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury Department require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal 
30
activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with these regulations.
Our riverboats must comply with certain federal and state laws and regulations with respect to boat design, on-board facilities, equipment, personnel and safety. In addition, we are required to have third parties periodically inspect and certify all of our casino barges for stability and single compartment flooding integrity. Our casino barges also must meet local fire safety standards. We would incur additional costs if any of our gaming facilities were not in compliance with one or more of these regulations.
We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to zoning, construction, land use, employment, marketing and advertising and the sale of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The imposition of a substantial penalty or the loss of service of a gaming facility for a significant period of time would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Dividends
We have paid four quarterly dividends each year on our common stock since 2004, except for 2008, when we made three quarterly dividend payments. The payment of future dividends will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements and other factors.
In each of 2011 and 2010, we paid four quarterly cash dividends of $0.105 per share, for an annual total of $0.42 per share.
Our senior credit facility obligates us to comply with certain covenants that place limitations on the payment of dividends. On April 14, 2011, we refinanced our debt and our new senior credit facility permits annual dividends of up to $12.0 million from April 14, 2011 through December 31, 2011 and up to $16.0 million during any fiscal year thereafter, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we paid dividends totaling $16.4 million, of which $10.3 million was paid after April 14, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid dividends totaling $24.4 million. Our prior senior credit facilities permitted annual dividends of up to $30.0 million, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. See “Item 7.

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in this Report. The information in this section and in this Report generally includes forward-looking statements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Overview
We develop, own and operate casinos and related hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other facilities, with eight properties in operation in Missouri, Iowa, Colorado, Mississippi, Indiana and Nevada. Our portfolio of casinos consists of: Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (serving the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (serving the Kansas City metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs (serving the Omaha, Nebraska metropolitan area and southwestern Iowa); Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk (serving the Denver metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg (serving Jackson, Mississippi and Monroe, Louisiana); Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago (serving the Chicagoland area); and Cactus Petes Resort Casino and The Horseshu Hotel and Casino in Jackpot, Nevada (serving Idaho and the Pacific Northwest).
Our financial results are dependent upon the number of patrons that we attract to our properties and the amounts those guests spend per visit. Additionally, our operating results may be affected by, among other things, overall economic conditions impacting the disposable income of our guests, weather conditions affecting our properties, achieving and maintaining cost efficiencies, competitive factors, gaming tax increases and other regulatory changes, the commencement of new gaming operations, charges associated with debt refinancing or property acquisition and disposition transactions, construction at existing facilities and general public sentiment regarding travel. We may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to seasonality, variations in gaming hold percentages and other factors. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter or year are not necessarily comparable and may not be indicative of future periods’ results. Historically, our fourth quarter is weaker than other periods due mostly to the combined effects of inclement weather and guest visitation and spending patterns between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. 
The following significant factors and trends should be considered in relation to our operating performance:
•
General Economic Conditions.
 Over the last few years, the weak economic conditions have adversely impacted our business volumes and the amount our guests spend at our properties. However, we have recently seen some indications of stability. Additionally, we have implemented operating and marketing efficiencies and significantly reduced our cost structure in response to the weak economic conditions. These enhancements have improved our operating margins.

•
Estate Stock Repurchase and Debt Refinancing
. Following the execution of a binding letter agreement entered into on February 27, 2011, on March 25, 2011 we entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement with the Estate of Craig H. Neilsen (the “Estate”), our then majority stockholder, to purchase 26,150,000 shares of our common stock held by the Estate at a purchase price of $17.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $457,625,000 (the “Repurchase Transaction”). The Repurchase Transaction was completed on April 19, 2011 and reduced our outstanding shares by approximately 45%.
 
On April 14, 2011, we obtained $2.2 billion of new debt financing (the “Debt Refinancing”). Proceeds from the Debt Refinancing were used to (i) repurchase substantially all of our outstanding 9¼% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”), including payment of the tender premium and accrued interest, (ii) prepay and permanently retire all of the indebtedness under our prior senior secured credit facility, (iii) complete the Repurchase Transaction and (iv) pay related fees and expenses. The Debt Refinancing extended the maturities of all of our debt and significantly reduced the principal amortization previously required under our debt agreements for the years ending December 31, 2011 and 2012. As a result of these transactions, in the 2011 second quarter we recorded on a pre-tax basis an $85.3 million loss on early retirement of debt.
•
Stock Repurchase Program
. On September 15, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $75 million of our common stock in a stock repurchase program. The program provides that we may repurchase the shares through September 30, 2014 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 0.3 million shares, or 1% of our outstanding stock, under the program for $5.2 million at an average price of $16.23 per share, exclusive of commissions paid.

Debt and Interest Expense. 
At December 31, 2011, total debt was $1.9 billion. Excluding the incurrence of and application of proceeds from the new debt in the Debt Refinancing, net debt repayments totaled $194.3 million during 2011, equaling approximately one-third of the incremental debt from the Debt Refinancing. Since the Debt Refinancing and Repurchase Transaction, net repayments included $129.0 million in repayments of a portion of the principal balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $5.3 million for the quarterly amortization payments under the B term loan. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was $257.0 million, after giving effect to $4.0 million of outstanding letters of credit.
Consolidated net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased when compared to 2010 by $14.6 million, or 12.1%. Our interest expense decreased significantly in 2011 primarily as a result of the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in July 2010 and the lower interest rates achieved through the April 2011 Debt Refinancing. In 2010, consolidated net interest expense increased by $14.4 million, or 13.5%, compared to 2009, as a result of a senior credit facility amendment, senior secured notes issuance and extension of our revolving loan facility that all took place in 2009. Net interest expense also increased due to a decrease in capitalized interest from $9.0 million in 2009 to $0.7 million in 2010, primarily due to the completion of the Ameristar Black Hawk hotel.

Ameristar East Chicago. 
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Indiana Department of Transportation (“INDOT”) closed the Cline Avenue highway bridge near our property due to safety concerns. The bridge closure has adversely impacted access to our property and our business volumes. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2009 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $111.7 million ($66.2 million on an after-tax basis) for the impairment of goodwill related to our East Chicago property acquisition. During the second quarter of 2010, we recorded another non-cash charge of $56.0 million ($33.2 million on an after-tax basis) for the impairment of goodwill and the gaming license. The property’s net revenues stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2010 and have increased year-over-year for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
Recently, INDOT has indicated that it is in discussions with private parties to  rebuild the bridge and convert the highway to a toll road. At this time, it is unclear if the bridge will in fact be rebuilt, the timing of this project or, if the bridge is rebuilt, how the imposition of tolls may affect visitation to Ameristar East Chicago. If the bridge is not rebuilt, area surface streets are expected to be improved by INDOT.

Ameristar Black Hawk.
 In July 2009, positive statewide regulatory changes became effective in Black Hawk. The regulatory changes extended casino operating hours from 18 hours daily to 24 hours daily, increased the maximum single bet limit from $5 to up to $100 and allowed for the additional table games of roulette and craps. Also, in September 2009, we opened a 536-room luxury hotel and spa featuring upscale furnishings and amenities. The hotel includes a versatile meeting and ballroom center and has Black Hawk’s only full-service spa and an enclosed rooftop 
36
swimming pool with indoor/outdoor whirlpool facilities. Ameristar Black Hawk offers destination resort amenities and services that we believe are unequaled in the Denver gaming market. As a result of these regulatory changes and the opening of the new hotel, net revenues and operating income increased year-over-year in 2010 by 47.6% and 106.6%, respectively, compared to 2009. The property also increased its 2010 annual market share on a year-over-year basis from 20.5% to 27.5%. Ameristar Black Hawk continued to show improvement in 2011, as evidenced by year-over-year growth in net revenues, operating income and operating income margin. 
•
Missouri Properties.
 In early March 2010, a gaming operator opened a new casino facility located in the southeastern portion of St. Louis County, approximately 30 miles from our St. Charles property. The additional competition has adversely affected the financial performance of Ameristar St. Charles and the other facilities that operate in the market. The new casino contributed to declines in our property’s 2010 net revenues and operating income of 8.1% and 16.2%, respectively, compared to 2009. Ameristar St. Charles showed improvement in 2011, as evidenced by increases in 2011 net revenues and operating income of 1.0% and 15.5%, respectively, compared to 2010.
On February 3, 2012, a casino operator opened a large land-based casino and entertainment facility at the Kansas Speedway, approximately 24 miles from Ameristar Kansas City. The new facility will provide significant additional competition for the Kansas City market and it could have a material adverse effect on the future financial performance of Ameristar Kansas City.

Year Ended December 31, 2011 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2010
Net Revenues
Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $25.2 million, or 2.1%, from 2010. Net revenues improved on a year-over-year basis at six of our seven gaming locations, while net revenues at our Jackpot properties remained relatively flat. The improvement in net revenues was primarily attributable to our high quality service and amenities,  our detailed attention to cost containment and effective marketing initiatives. The net revenue improvements occurred despite the additional competition in the broader Chicago market.
Consolidated casino revenues for 2011 increased $1.6 million from the prior year. All of our properties, except Ameristar Black Hawk and our two Missouri properties, posted casino revenue improvements compared to 2010, primarily as a result of the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated promotional allowances declined $23.5 million, or 7.8%, from the same 2010 period. The decrease in promotional allowances was primarily the result of more efficient promotional spending in 2011. Also, 2010 promotional spending levels were elevated due to increased spending to counter the East Chicago bridge closure and to market the new Black Hawk hotel that opened in September 2009. 2011 promotional spending was similar to 2009 levels, taking into consideration the increase in promotional spending related to the new hotel in Black Hawk. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, promotional allowances as a percentage of casino revenues were 22.3%, 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively.
Operating Income
Consolidated operating income for 2011 was $227.2 million, compared to $140.1 million reported in 2010. Operating income improved at all seven of our locations on a year-over-year basis primarily due to our operating and marketing enhancements. Operating income for 2010 was adversely impacted by the non-cash impairment charge of $56.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2010, the new competition entering the St. Charles market and unusually low table games hold percentages. 
Corporate expense increased $15.7 million, or 25.4%, in 2011 as compared to 2010.  The increase was mostly attributable to a $10.0 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense primarily resulting from equity award modifications that increased and/or accelerated the recognition of this expense.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, consolidated interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, decreased $14.6 million (12.1%) from 2010. The decrease is primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in July 2010 and the lower interest rates achieved through the April 2011 Debt Refinancing.
Income Tax Expense
The income tax provision was $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $12.1 million for 2010. For 2011 and 2010, our effective income tax rates were 80.3% and 58.4%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the debt refinancing costs, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 would have been 48.3%. Excluding the impact of the intangible asset impairments at Ameristar East Chicago in 2010, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been 45.5%.
Net Income
For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we reported net income of $6.8 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The decrease is primarily attributable to the loss on early retirement of debt of $85.3 million recognized in connection with the Debt Refinancing in April 2011. The East Chicago impairment charges adversely affected net income in 2010 by $33.2 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for 2011, compared to $0.15 in the prior year. The reduction in our weighted-average shares outstanding as a result of the Repurchase Transaction benefited 2011 diluted earnings per share by $0.54.
Year Ended December 31, 2010 Versus Year Ended December 31, 2009
Net Revenues
Consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $26.2 million, or 2.2%, from 2009. Net revenues declined on a year-over-year basis at six of our seven gaming locations. These declines were partially mitigated by an increase in revenues at Ameristar Black Hawk. We believe the weak national economic conditions, the permanent closure of the East Chicago Cline Avenue bridge, the increased competition in our St. Charles market and unusually low table games hold percentages adversely impacted financial results in 2010. Ameristar Black Hawk’s 2010 net revenues increased by $49.1 million, or 47.6%, compared to 2009. The increase is primarily attributable to the opening of the new hotel in September 2009 and the implementation of the beneficial regulatory reform in July 2009.
Consolidated casino revenues for 2010 decreased $7.6 million from the prior year. All of our properties, except Ameristar Black Hawk and Ameristar Council Bluffs, posted casino revenue declines compared to 2009, primarily as a result of the difficult economic conditions, the East Chicago bridge closure and the increased St. Charles competition indicated above.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated promotional allowances increased $28.4 million, or 10.4%, from the same 2009 period. The increase in promotional allowances was primarily the result of additional promotional spending related to the new hotel in Black Hawk and our efforts to attract guests to our East Chicago property following the bridge closure. For 2010 and 2009, promotional allowances as a percentage of casino revenues were 24.3% and 21.9%, respectively.
Operating Income
Consolidated operating income for 2010 was $140.1 million, compared to $103.5 million reported in 2009. Operating income for 2010 was adversely impacted by the non-cash impairment charge of $56.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2010 that eliminated the remaining net book value of goodwill associated with the acquisition of the East Chicago property and reduced the carrying value of the property’s gaming license to $12.6 million, the new competition entering the St. Charles market 
40
and unusually low table games hold percentages. The 2009 consolidated operating income and the related margin were negatively impacted by $111.7 million in impairment charges for goodwill at Ameristar East Chicago, $3.9 million of hotel pre-opening expenses, $3.8 million in impairment losses relating to discontinued expansion projects and $1.3 million relating to a one-time non-cash adjustment to property taxes at Ameristar Black Hawk. Ameristar Black Hawk’s 2010 operating income increased by $17.1 million, or 106.6%, as a result of the opening of the new hotel and the beneficial regulatory reform. In 2010, operating income increased from 2009 by 1.9% at Ameristar Vicksburg and remained relatively flat at Ameristar Council Bluffs, despite slight declines in net revenues. Corporate expense increased $1.6 million, or 2.7%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 due mostly to $1.5 million of non-operational professional fees.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, consolidated interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, increased $14.4 million (13.5%) from 2009. The increase is due primarily to higher interest rate add-ons resulting from the senior credit facility amendment, increased interest expense from the issuance of our 9¼% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and the incremental interest incurred on the portion of the revolving credit facility that was extended. Additionally, since the opening of the Ameristar Black Hawk hotel, we no longer capitalize the interest on the associated debt, which has caused our net interest expense to rise relative to prior periods.
Income Tax Expense
The income tax provision was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a tax benefit of $1.5 million for 2009. For 2010 and 2009, our effective income tax rates were 58.4% and 24.3%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the intangible asset impairments at Ameristar East Chicago in both 2010 and 2009, the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2010 would have been 45.5%, compared to 41.8% for 2009. This increase is mostly attributable to the absence in 2010 of benefits from the permanent reversal of uncertain tax positions in 2009.
Net Income (Loss)
For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we reported net income of $8.6 million and a net loss of $4.7 million, respectively. The East Chicago impairment charges adversely affected net income in 2010 and 2009 by $33.2 million and $66.2 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for 2010, compared to diluted loss per share of $0.08 in the prior year. The East Chicago impairment charges adversely affected diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 by $0.56 and $1.15, respectively.

Our business is primarily conducted on a cash basis. Accordingly, operating cash flows follow trends in our operating income, excluding non-cash items. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities increased $34.5 million from the 2010 period, mostly as a result of an improvement in our operating income and lower interest paid in 2011. The decrease in operating cash flows from 2009 to 2010 was mostly attributable to the changed competitive environments at the Ameristar St. Charles and Ameristar East Chicago properties, offset by the changes in our accounts payable and deferred income tax balances in 2010.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 included slot machine purchases, the Ameristar East Chicago hotel renovation, an Ameristar Vicksburg site stabilization project and the acquisition of long-lived assets relating to various capital maintenance projects at all of our properties. At Ameristar East Chicago, we recently completed the renovation of all 288 hotel rooms and suites. Capital expenditures relating to the hotel renovation project totaled $5.4 million in 2011. The total cost of the renovation is expected to be approximately $6.7 million. At Ameristar Vicksburg, we incurred $3.6 million relating to site stabilization work that we estimate will be completed during the latter half of 2012. The total cost of the project is anticipated to be approximately $10.0 million. Also in December 2011, we paid a litigation settlement of $9.3 million to the general contractor for our St. Charles hotel construction project that was completed in 2008, resulting in an increase to the fixed asset carrying values associated with the St. Charles project.
For the year ended December 31, 2010, capital expenditures were primarily related to minor construction projects, slot machine purchases and the acquisition of long-lived assets relating to various capital maintenance projects at all of our properties. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our hotel project at Ameristar Black Hawk, slot machine purchases and the acquisition of long-lived assets relating to various capital maintenance projects for the year ended December 31, 2009. We completed construction of the luxury hotel and spa at Ameristar Black Hawk, which opened in September 2009. Capital expenditures relating to the hotel project totaled $74.7 million in 2009. The total cost of the project was approximately $230.0 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash used in investing activities was impacted by a $32.5 million payment to multiple East Chicago entities to support and assist economic development through specified initiatives pursuant to a local development agreement. For more information, see “Note 14 — Commitments and contingencies” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.105 per share on our common stock.
Liquidity
On April 14, 2011, we obtained $2.2 billion of new debt financing, consisting of a $1.4 billion senior secured credit facility (the “New Credit Facility”) and $800.0 million principal amount of unsecured 7.50% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The New Credit Facility consists of (i) a $200 million A term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in 2016, (ii) a $700 million B term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in 2018 and (iii) a $500 million revolving loan facility, $368 million of which was borrowed at closing and which matures in 2016. Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, we have the option to increase the total amount available under the New Credit Facility by up to the greater of an additional $200 million or an amount determined by reference to our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement).
The A term loan and the revolving loan facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.75% per annum or the base rate plus 1.75% per annum, at our option. The B term loan bears interest at LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.0%) plus 3.0% per annum or the base rate (subject to a base rate floor of 2.0%) plus 2.0% per annum, at our option. The LIBOR margin for the A term loan and the revolving loan facility is subject to reduction based on our Total Net Leverage Ratio. We pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility of 0.50% per annum, which is subject to reduction based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. Borrowings under the New Credit Facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets.
The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, with the initial interest payment made on October 15, 2011. The 2021 Notes mature on April 15, 2021. 
The New Credit Facility agreement requires certain mandatory principal repayments prior to maturity for both term loans. The A term loan requires the following principal amortization: 3.75% in 2012; 12.5% in 2013; 18.75% in 2014; 50% in 2015; and the remaining 15% in 2016. The B term loan requires mandatory principal reductions of 1% per annum, with the remaining 93.25% due at maturity. In addition to the scheduled mandatory principal repayments of the term loans, the New Credit Facility agreement also requires permanent principal repayments of the term loans equal to 25% of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement) if our Total Net Leverage Ratio is above 4.75:1 at year-end. Excess Cash Flow repayments are required to be made 120 days after the last day of each fiscal year and are allocated between both term loans on a pro-rata basis. We expect the Excess Cash Flow repayment for the year ended December 31, 2011 to be approximately $8.6 million.
Proceeds from the Debt Refinancing were used to (i) repurchase substantially all of our 9¼% senior notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”) tendered pursuant to our tender offer announced on March 29, 2011, including payment of the tender premium and accrued interest, (ii) prepay and permanently retire all of the indebtedness under our prior credit facility, (iii) complete the Repurchase Transaction on April 19, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of $457.6 million and (iv) pay related fees and expenses.
In connection with the Debt Refinancing, we paid one-time fees and expenses totaling approximately $30.8 million, most of which was capitalized and will be amortized over the respective remaining terms of the 2021 Notes and New Credit Facility. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, approximately $85.3 million relating to the tender premium and deferred debt issuance costs were expensed as a result of the early retirement of debt.
During 2011, we used $194.3 million of our operating cash flow to repay amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility, equaling approximately one-third of the incremental debt from the Debt Refinancing. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was $257.0 million, after giving effect to $4.0 million of outstanding letters of credit. All mandatory principal payments have been made through December 31, 2011.
Our interest expense decreased significantly in 2011 primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in July 2010 and the lower interest rates achieved through the Debt Refinancing.
On September 15, 2011, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $75 million of our common stock through September 30, 2014. During 2011, we repurchased a total of approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock, or 1% of our total outstanding stock, under the program at an average price of $16.23 per share, exclusive of commissions paid, for a total cost of $5.2 million.
In addition to the availability under the New Credit Facility, we had $85.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011, approximately $70 million to $75 million of which were required for daily operations.
Historically, we have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows, bank debt and other debt financing. If our existing sources of cash are insufficient to meet our operations and liquidity requirements, we will be required to seek additional financing that would likely be more expensive than the New Credit Facility and/or scale back our capital plans or reduce other expenditures. Any loss from service of our properties for any reason could materially adversely affect us, including our ability to fund daily operations 
43
and to satisfy debt covenants.
Inflation
Although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations, we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations in the last three years.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K.

Estimated interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts outstanding after giving effect to projected debt principal payments and forecasted LIBOR rates for our senior credit facility.
As further discussed in “Note 5 — Federal and state income taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740. We had $5.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions, it is not possible to assign the liability as of December 31, 2011 to any particular years in the table.
As noted above, a significant use of operating cash in 2011 was interest and debt payments. Our cash interest payments, excluding capitalized interest, were $98.0 million, $118.8 million and $104.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. For more information, see “Note 1 — Basis of presentation” and “Note 6 — Long-term debt” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business, including construction contracts for projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole. Our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts.
At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $4.0 million, which reduced the amount available to borrow under our revolving loan facility. We do not have any other guarantees, contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements or disclosed in the notes thereto. For more information, see “Note 6 — Long-term debt” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and, generally to a lesser extent, cash flows. Senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates.
Property and Equipment
We have significant capital invested in our property and equipment, which represents approximately 86%
 
of our total 
44
assets. Judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. We test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. 
We perform the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. We consider both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and make a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying amount, we are required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, we are not required to perform the two-step impairment test.
Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, we compare the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, we determine the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.
We test our gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
Guest Rewards Programs
Our guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests’ gaming activity. Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, we accrue the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance.
Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons
Our gaming guests may be awarded, on a discretionary basis, cash, hotel and food coupons based, in part, on their play volume. The coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period (generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons). There is no ability to renew or extend the offer. We recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed.
Self-Insurance Reserves
We are self-insured for various levels of general liability, workers’ compensation and employee health coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims. We consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities. We believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals; however, changes in health care costs, accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. In  2003, the Company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider. The Company currently has $5.9 million deposited in a trust account as collateral for the Company’s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the self-retained portion of our workers’ compensation claims.
45
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation 
All share-based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date. We recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides services in exchange for the award. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. We are required to include an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and update that number based on actual forfeitures.
Income Taxes
Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where we operate. We assess potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of ASC 740, which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not (i.e., the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%) to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
The tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position be derecognized. As applicable, we recognize accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Litigation, Claims and Assessments
We utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters. These estimates are in accordance with accounting standards regarding contingencies and are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events, as well as upon reasonable assumptions about future events. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
ASU No. 2010-16,
 Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued ASU No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
. The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, we recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, we reduced our recorded accrual by $5.6 million ($3.4 million net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.
ASU No. 2011-04
, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
 (“International Financial Reporting Standards”). The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and IFRS requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements. The update became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-05
, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, 
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 in June 2011. This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; 
46
however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Since the update only requires a change in presentation, the early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-08
, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 in September 2011. This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facility. Outstanding amounts borrowed under our senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (in the case of Eurodollar loans) or the prime interest rate (in the case of base rate loans), plus an applicable margin, or “add-on.” As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.1 billion outstanding under our senior credit facility, which represents approximately 59% of our total outstanding debt, bearing interest at variable rates indexed to one-month LIBOR, based on our election. At December 31, 2011, the average interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding was 3.6%. An increase of one percentage point in the interest rate applicable to the senior credit facility debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 would increase our annual interest cost and reduce our pre-tax income by $6.4 million. The remaining 41% of our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011, primarily consisting of our 7.5% senior notes due 2021, bears interest at fixed rates. 
We have used interest rate swap agreements in the past to manage interest rate risk. (See “Note 7 - Derivative instruments and hedging activities” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more discussion of the interest rate swaps.) We may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements from time to time in the future, although we have no current intention to do so. 
Should we elect to use derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates in the future, we would be exposed to the potential failure of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements. We would seek to minimize this risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements with highly rated commercial banks.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, the Company’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
. Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page F-2.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries:
We have audited Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

AMERISTAR CASINOS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 — Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. (“ACI”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). Through its subsidiaries, the Company owns and operates 
eight
 casino properties in 
seven
 markets. The Company’s portfolio of casinos consists of: Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (serving the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (serving the Kansas City metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs (serving the Omaha, Nebraska metropolitan area and southwestern Iowa); Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk (serving the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg (serving Jackson, Mississippi and Monroe, Louisiana); Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago (serving the Chicagoland area); and Cactus Petes Resort Casino and The Horseshu Hotel and Casino in Jackpot, Nevada (serving Idaho and the Pacific Northwest). The Company views each property as an operating segment and all such operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The Company has evaluated certain events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2011 and determined that none met the definition of a subsequent event for purposes of recognition or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Note 2 — Summary of significant accounting policies
Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company’s judgments are based in part on its historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value, due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Restricted cash
On September 2, 2003, the Company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has 
$5.9 million
 deposited in a trust account as collateral for the Company’s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the Company’s workers’ compensation claims. The Company is permitted to invest the trust funds in certain investment vehicles with stated maturity dates not to exceed six months. Any interest or other earnings are disbursed to the Company. The Company utilized Level 1 inputs as described in “Note 8 - Fair value measurements” to determine fair value.
Accounts receivable
Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the financial statements as an operating expense. Management believes that as of December 31, 2011, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivable were 
$5.8 million
 and 
$8.8 million
, respectively. Gaming receivables were 
$1.2 million
 and 
$4.0 million
 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, an allowance of 
$0.4 million
 and 
$1.4 million
, respectively, has been applied to reduce total accounts receivable to amounts anticipated to be collected.
Inventories
Inventories primarily consist of food and beverage items, gift shop and general store retail merchandise, engineering and slot supplies, uniforms, linens, china and other general supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on the weighted-average basis.
F-9
AMERISTAR CASINOS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Capitalization and depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, including capitalized interest cost associated with major development and construction projects. When no debt is incurred specifically for construction projects, interest is capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period. Interest of 
$0.5 million
, 
$0.7 million
 and 
$9.0 million
 was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Betterments, renewals and repairs that either materially add to the value of an asset or appreciably extend its useful life are capitalized. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of major renovation projects are capitalized in accordance with existing policies.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method. Amortization of building and furniture, fixtures and equipment under capitalized leases is provided over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the associated lease (including lease renewals or purchase options the Company expects to exercise). Depreciation and amortization is provided over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings and improvements        
5
 to 
40
 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment        
3
 to 
10
 years
Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Impairment of long-lived assets 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews long-lived assets for such events or changes in circumstances at each balance sheet date. If a long-lived asset is to be held and used, the Company assesses recoverability based on the future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life compared to the asset’s book value. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If an impairment exists, the asset is adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or another valuation technique, such as discounted cash flow analysis. If a long-lived asset is to be sold, the asset is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, with fair value measured as discussed above.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of 
$0.2 million
, 
$0.2 million
 and 
$3.8 million
, respectively, related to previously capitalized design costs on discontinued expansion projects.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. 
The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. The Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than the carrying amount, the Company is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform the two-step impairment test.
Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, the Company compares the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, the Company determines the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.
The Company tests its gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
See also “Note 13 - Goodwill and other intangible assets.”

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Debt issuance costs
Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method or a method that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt instrument. The Company expenses debt issuance costs proportionately in connection with any early debt retirements.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. For a derivative such as an interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. To the extent the effective portion of a hedge subsequently becomes ineffective, the corresponding amount of the change in fair value of the derivative initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified and is recognized directly in earnings. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of a hypothetical designated perfect hedged item or transaction. If the change in the actual swap is greater than the change in the hypothetical perfect swap, the difference is referred to as “ineffectiveness” and is recognized in earnings in the current period.
Revenue recognition
Casino revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons. Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue upon the occupancy of its hotel rooms, upon the delivery of food, beverage and other services and upon performance for entertainment revenue. The retail value of hotel accommodations, food and beverage items and entertainment provided to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues. Promotional allowances consist of the retail value of complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment, progress towards earning points for cash-based loyalty programs and targeted direct mail coin coupons.
The estimated departmental costs of providing complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment and other are included in casino operating expenses and consisted of the following:

Guest Rewards Programs
The Company’s guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests’ gaming activity. Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, the Company accrues the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding guest reward point liability was 
$16.0 million
 and 
$13.9 million
, respectively.
Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons
The Company’s gaming guests may be awarded cash, hotel and food coupons based, in part, on their gaming play volume. The coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period (generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons). There is no ability to renew or extend the offer. The Company recognizes a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed.

Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately 
$30.3 million
, 
$26.1 million
 and 
$27.6 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Income taxes
The guidance for income taxes requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where the Company operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not (i.e., the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%) to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
The tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position be derecognized. As applicable, the Company recognizes accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Earnings (loss) per share
The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing reported earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and restricted stock units. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, all outstanding options with an exercise price lower than the average market price for the period have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted loss per share excludes the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options and restricted stock units.
The weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share consisted of the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the potentially dilutive stock options excluded from the earnings (loss) per share computation, as their effect would be anti-dilutive, totaled 
2.5 million
, 
3.3 million
 and 
3.2 million
, respectively.
Accounting for stock-based compensation
The Company has various stock incentive plans for directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisers of the Company.  The plans permit the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units or any combination of the foregoing. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company’s cost relating to stock-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. The guidance for stock-based compensation

also requires an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and updating that number based on actual forfeitures.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
ASU No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
. The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, the Company reduced its recorded accrual by 
$5.6 million
 (
$3.4 million
 net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.
ASU No. 2011-04
, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
. The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements. The update became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-05
, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, 
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 in June 2011. This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Since the update only requires a change in presentation, the early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-08
, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 in September 2011. This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Note 3 — Missouri Development District receivables
In 1997, the Missouri 210 Highway Transportation Development District (the “Highway 210 District”) was formed to finance a highway improvement project near the Kansas City property prior to the Company’s purchase of that property. In December 2000, the Company purchased the Kansas City property and assumed several agreements related to the Highway 210 District, including a guarantee by the Kansas City property to fund any shortfall payments related to the Highway 210 District’s debt service obligations. Through December 31, 2011, the Company had funded 
$2.0 million
 in shortfall payments. Under the agreements, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for the shortfall payments plus accrued interest by the Highway 210 District. The Company has classified these shortfall payments as a long-term receivable included in deposits and other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and anticipates that it will be reimbursed in full from the Highway 210 District’s future available cash flows.
In 2005, the St. Charles Riverfront Transportation Development District (the “Riverfront District”) was formed to finance certain improvements to the access roads near the St. Charles property. The St. Charles Riverfront Community Improvement District was also formed in 2005 to provide incremental funding to the Riverfront District. In connection with the establishment of the Riverfront District, the Company agreed to pay certain costs associated with the road improvements and related administrative

costs. Under the Riverfront District agreements, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for these costs plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a balance due from the Riverfront District of approximately 
$14.7 million
. The Company has classified these payments as a long-term receivable included in deposits and other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and anticipates it will be reimbursed in full from the Riverfront District’s future available cash flows.

In general, the remaining unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2020 through 2029. No valuation allowance has been provided against deferred income tax assets as the Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, availability of tax strategies and future projected taxable income.

December 31, 2006.
The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2009 are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). In May 2011, the IRS issued a letter challenging the Company’s method of accounting for certain repair and maintenance expenses. The Company disagrees with the IRS determination and has submitted a protest and a request for an appeals conference to the IRS. In January 2012, an informal ruling was released by the IRS that agreed to the Company’s current method of accounting for a portion of expenses incurred for repairs of its gaming equipment. The remaining portion of repair expenses continues to be challenged by the IRS. 
The Company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions; however, there is no assurance that the taxing authorities will not propose adjustments that are different from the Company’s expected outcome and impact the provision for income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On April 14, 2011, ACI obtained 
$2.2 billion
 of new debt financing (the “Debt Refinancing”), consisting of a 
$1.4 billion
 senior secured credit facility (the “New Credit Facility”) and 
$800.0 million
 principal amount of unsecured 
7.50%
 senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The New Credit Facility consists of (i) a 
$200 million
 A term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in April 2016, (ii) a 
$700 million
 B term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in April 2018 and (iii) a 
$500 million
 revolving loan facility, 
$368 million
 of which was borrowed at closing and which matures in April 2016. The 2021 Notes were sold at a price of 
99.125%
 of the principal amount, and the 
$700.0 million
 B term loan was sold at a price of 
99.75%
 of the principal amount. Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, ACI has the option to increase the total amount available under the New Credit Facility by up to the greater of an additional 
$200 million
 or an amount determined by reference to the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement).
The A term loan and the revolving loan facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 
2.75%
 per annum or the base rate plus 
1.75%
 per annum, at ACI’s option. The B term loan bears interest at LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR floor of 
1.0%
) plus 
3.0%
 per annum or the base rate (subject to a base rate floor of 
2.0%
) plus 
2.0%
 per annum, at ACI’s option. The LIBOR margin for the A term loan and the revolving loan facility is subject to reduction based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement. ACI pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility of 
0.50%
 per annum, which is subject to reduction based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio.
The New Credit Facility agreement requires certain mandatory principal repayments prior to maturity for both term loans. The A term loan requires the following principal amortization: 
3.75%
 in 2012; 
12.5%
 in 2013; 
18.75%
 in 2014; 
50%
 in 2015; and the remaining 
15%
 in 2016. The B term loan requires mandatory principal reductions of 
1%
 per annum, with the remaining 
93.25%
 due at maturity. In addition to the scheduled mandatory principal repayments of the term loans, the New Credit Facility agreement also requires permanent principal repayments of the term loans equal to 
25%
 of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement) if the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio is above 
4.75
:1 at year-end. Excess Cash Flow repayments are required to be made 120 days after the last day of each fiscal year and are allocated between both term loans on a pro-rata basis. The Company expects the Excess Cash Flow repayment for the year ended December 31, 2011 to be approximately 
$8.6 million
.
At 
December 31, 2011
, the Company’s principal debt outstanding under the New Credit Facility consisted of 
$239.0 million
 under the revolving loan facility, 
$200.0 million
 under the A term loan facility and 
$693.2 million
 (net of discount) under the B term loan facility. All mandatory principal repayments have been made through 
December 31, 2011
. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was 
$257.0 million
, after giving effect to 
$4.0 million
 of outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with obtaining the New Credit Facility, certain of ACI’s subsidiaries, including each of its material subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), entered into a guaranty (the “Guaranty”) pursuant to which the Guarantors guaranteed ACI’s obligations under the New Credit Facility. The obligations of ACI under the New Credit Facility, and of the Guarantors under the Guaranty, are secured by substantially all of the assets of ACI and the Guarantors.
The terms of the 2021 Notes are governed by an indenture. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
7.50%
 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, with the initial interest payment made on October 15, 2011. The 2021 Notes mature on April 15, 2021. The 2021 Notes and the guarantees of the 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ACI and the Guarantors, respectively, and rank, in right of payment, equally with or senior to all existing or future unsecured indebtedness of ACI and each Guarantor, respectively, but are effectively subordinated in right of payment to the New Credit Facility indebtedness and any future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
The Guarantors have jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed the 2021 Notes. Each of the Guarantors is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ACI, and the Guarantors constitute substantially all of ACI’s direct and indirect subsidiaries. ACI is a holding company with no operations or material assets independent of those of the Guarantors and, other than its investment in the Guarantors, the aggregate assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of the Guarantors are substantially equivalent to the assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of the Company on a consolidated basis. Separate financial statements and certain other disclosures concerning the Guarantors are not presented because, in the opinion of management, such information is not material to investors. Other than customary restrictions imposed by applicable statutes, there are no restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to transfer funds to ACI in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.
Proceeds from the Debt Refinancing were used to (i) repurchase substantially all of ACI’s outstanding 
9.25%

Facility. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, approximately 
$85.3 million
 relating to the tender premium and deferred debt issuance costs were expensed as a result of the early retirement of debt.
Debt covenants
The agreement governing the New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company was required to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio, calculated as consolidated debt (net of certain cash and cash equivalents) divided by EBITDA, as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement, of no more than 
7.00
:1, and a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, calculated as senior secured debt (net of certain cash and cash equivalents) divided by EBITDA, of no more than 
4.50
:1. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio was 
5.04
:1. The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as of 
December 31, 2011
 was 
2.86
:1. Under the New Credit Facility, as of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company was required to maintain an Interest Expense Coverage Ratio, calculated as EBITDA divided by cash interest expense, of at least 
2.00
:1. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Interest Expense Coverage Ratio was 
3.29
:1.
The New Credit Facility permits the Company to make annual dividend payments of up to 
$12.0 million
 from April 14, 2011 through December 31, 2011 and up to 
$16.0 million
 during any fiscal year thereafter, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. For the year ended 
December 31, 2011
, the Company paid dividends totaling 
$16.4 million
, of which 
$10.3 million
 was paid after April 14, 2011.
The New Credit Facility limits the Company’s capital expenditures to 
$80.0 million
 during any fiscal year through the final maturity of the New Credit Facility, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. As of 
December 31, 2011
, capital expenditures made during the term of the New Credit Facility totaled 
$69.3 million
.
The indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains covenants that limit ACI’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ (as defined in the indenture) ability to, among other things, (i) pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase equity securities, prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments, (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock or preferred stock, (iii) create liens on assets, (iv) merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets and (v) enter into transactions with affiliates.  In addition, pursuant to the indenture, if ACI experiences certain changes of control, each holder of the 2021 Notes can require ACI to repurchase all or a portion of such holder’s outstanding 2021 Notes at a price of 
101%
 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facilities and the senior notes outstanding at the respective dates.
Note 7 — 
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the guidance under ASC Topic 815. The guidance provides users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under the previous guidance and its related interpretations and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In 2008, the Company entered into two forward interest rate swaps with two different commercial banks to fix the interest rate on certain LIBOR-based borrowings under its credit facility. Both swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Pursuant to each of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company was obligated to make quarterly fixed rate payments to the counterparty, while the counterparty was obligated to make quarterly variable rate payments to the Company based on three-month LIBOR on the same notional amount.
The Company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives in place.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the interest rate swap liability was 
zero
 due to the expiration of both interest rate swap agreements on July 19, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the swaps increased the Company’s interest expense by 
$16.8 million
.
There was no net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 
$10.6 million
.
F-18
The Company may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements in the future, although it has no current intention to do so.
Note 8 — Fair value measurements
The Company measures the fair value of its deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities on a recurring basis pursuant to ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
Level 1:
  Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2:
  Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value driver is observable.
Level 3:
  Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data is available, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.
The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value as of December 31, 2011 (amounts in thousands):

The fair value of the deferred compensation assets is based on the cash surrender value of rabbi trust-owned life insurance policies, which are invested in variable life insurance separate accounts that are similar to mutual funds. These investments are in the same accounts and purchased in substantially the same amounts as the deferred compensation plan participants’ selected investments, which represent the underlying liabilities to participants. Liabilities under the deferred compensation plan are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’ selected investments.
Fair value of long-term debt
The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2011 was approximately 
$1.951 billion
, versus its book value of 
$1.926 billion
. The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2010 was approximately 
$1.559 billion
, versus its book value of 
$1.530 billion
. The estimated fair value of the outstanding notes and the term loan facility debt was based on quoted market prices on or about December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The estimated fair value of the revolving loan facility debt was based on its bid price on or about December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.
Note 9 — Leases
Operating leases
The Company maintains operating leases for certain office and other facilities, vehicles, office equipment, signage and land. Rent expense under operating leases totaled 
$4.5 million
, 
$4.4 million
 and 
$3.6 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future minimum lease payments required under operating leases for each of the

Note 10 — Benefit plans
401(k) plan
The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which covers all employees who meet certain age and length of service requirements. Plan participants can elect to defer pre-tax compensation through payroll deductions. These deferrals are regulated under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches 
50%
 of eligible participants’ deferrals that do not exceed 
4%
 of their pay (subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code). The Company’s matching contributions were 
$1.8 million
, 
$2.1 million
 and 
$2.2 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Neither the 401(k) plan nor any other Company benefit plan holds or invests in shares of the Company’s common stock or derivative securities based on the Company’s common stock.
Health benefit plan
The Company maintains a qualified employee health benefit plan that is self-funded by the Company with respect to claims up to a certain amount. The plan requires contributions from eligible employees and their dependents. The Company’s contribution expense for the plan was approximately 
$28.3 million
, 
$32.0 million
 and 
$27.3 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled 
$3.4 million
, compared to 
$4.1 million
 at December 31, 2010.
Deferred compensation plan
In 2001, the Company adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees, which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2008. Through the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company matched, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to the first 
5%
 of participants’ annual salary deferrals and the first 
5%
 of participants’ annual bonus deferrals in each participant's account. Matching contributions by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 
$1.3 million
, 
$1.2 million
 and 
$0.9 million
, respectively. The Company’s obligation under the plan represents an unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, assets of the plan would be available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. To increase the security of the participants’ deferred compensation plan benefits, the Company has established and funded a grantor trust (known as a “rabbi trust”). The rabbi trust is specifically designed so that assets are available to pay plan benefits to participants in the event the Company is unwilling or unable to pay the plan benefits for any reason other than bankruptcy or insolvency. As a result, the Company is prevented from withdrawing or accessing assets for corporate needs. Plan participants choose to receive a return on their account balances equal to the return on various investment options. The Company currently invests plan assets in an equity-based life insurance product of which the rabbi trust is the owner and beneficiary.
Effective December 31, 2011, ACI’s Board of Directors terminated the deferred compensation plan. A partial distribution of plan assets was made to participants in May 2011. The Company anticipates making a final distribution of plan assets to participants in the second quarter of 2012. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, plan assets were 
$15.3 million
 and 
$18.2 million
, respectively, and are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the 2011 presentation and deposits and other assets in the 2010 presentation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities due the participants were 
$12.8 million
 and 
$15.7 million
 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the liability balance is reflected in accrued liabilities and in 2010, it is reflected in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, net deferred compensation expense was 
$2.1 million
, 
$1.4 million
 and 
$0.8 million
, respectively.
Note 11 — Stock-based compensation
The Company provides benefits to its employees in the form of stock-based payments, such as grants of stock options and restricted stock units, whereby employees render service in exchange for shares or rights to shares. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the currently effective plan is 
9.1 million
, subject to certain limitations. At December 31, 2011, 
4.4 million
 shares were available for issuance. The Compensation Committee of ACI’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) administers the Company’s stock incentive plans and has broad discretion to establish the terms of stock awards, including, without limitation, the power to set the term (up to 
10
 years), vesting schedule and exercise price of stock options.
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total stock-based compensation expense was 
$24.3 million
, 
$14.3 million
 and 
$12.9 million
, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately 
$27.1 million
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.8
 years.
In October 2011, the Compensation Committee approved certain modifications to awards outstanding under the stock incentive plans. The approved modifications included extending the lives of certain previously-granted stock option awards and providing for post-retirement vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock units to qualifying individuals. The Company 
F-20
recognized 
$7.3 million
 in non-cash stock-based compensation expense relating to these modifications in the fourth quarter of 2011.
In November 2011, the Compensation Committee granted certain members of senior management a total of 
1.2 million
 market performance-based stock options that consist of 
three
 tranches. Provided that certain service requirements are satisfied, these tranches vest and become exercisable, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which ACI’s common stock reaches certain market prices (as specified in the performance-based stock option award agreements) or (ii) the date on which a secondary vesting condition is met. The secondary vesting condition will be satisfied if the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the award agreements) for the period from the date of grant through December 31, 2018 is greater than 
zero
 and is higher than the Total Shareholder Return of each of the specified peer companies.
The fair value of the performance-based stock option grants was approximately 
$5.2 million
, with a weighted-average value of 
$4.55
 per share. The annual amortization expense related to these options is estimated to be approximately 
$1.3 million
, with approximately 
$0.1 million
 recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Stock options
Stock options are valued at the date of award, which does not precede the approval date, and compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. The outstanding time-vested stock options generally vest over 
four
 years and have 
10
-year contractual terms.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 
$3.7 million
, 
$2.5 million
 and 
$2.4 million
, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was 
$5.5 million
, 
$4.4 million
 and 
$6.1 million
 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 
$4.1 million
, 
$3.4 million
 and 
$4.6 million
, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that would have been realized by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the applicable date. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the excess of the Company’s closing stock price on that date over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options.
At December 31, 2011, the weighted-average remaining contractual life for stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable was 
6.3
 years and 
4.2
 years, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount of cash received by the Company from the exercise of stock options was 
$7.3 million
, 
$2.2 million
 and 
$2.1 million
, respectively.
The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility trends as well as implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties. In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior. The expected life represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related assumptions, used to determine compensation cost for the Company’s non-qualified stock options consistent with the requirements of ASC Topic 718.

Restricted stock units
For each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company granted restricted stock units in addition to stock options. The value of the restricted stock units at the date of grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for the restricted stock units that were granted is generally 
four
 years. The Company uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary.

Note 12 — Stock repurchases
On April 19, 2011, ACI purchased 
26,150,000
 shares of its common stock held by the Estate at 
$17.50
 per share, for a total of 
$457.6 million
. The purchase was made pursuant to a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered into by ACI and the Estate on March 25, 2011, following the execution of a binding letter agreement entered into on February 27, 2011. The shares purchased represented approximately 
45%
 of ACI’s outstanding shares and 
83%
 of the Estate’s holdings in the Company at the time of the purchase.
On September 15, 2011, ACI’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 
$75 million
 of ACI’s common stock in a stock repurchase program. The program provides that the shares may be repurchased by the Company through September 30, 2014 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company expects to fund repurchases using available cash and its existing senior credit facility. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the stock repurchase program, and purchases may be discontinued, or the stock 
F-22
repurchase program may be modified or terminated, at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased 
0.3 million
 shares under the stock repurchase program for 
$5.2 million
 at an average price of 
$16.23
 per share, exclusive of commissions paid. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in open market transactions. 
The Company additionally received treasury shares in satisfaction of employees’ income tax withholding liability with respect to the settlement of certain restricted stock units. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate cost of treasury shares received for these tax withholding obligations totaled 
$6.8 million
. 
As of December 31, 2011, a total of 
27.6 million
 treasury shares had been acquired at an aggregate cost of 
$487.2 million
, an average of 
$17.65
 per share.

At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 
$71.0 million
 in goodwill related to the acquisition of the Missouri properties in December 2000 and 
$12.6 million
 in other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Ameristar East Chicago in September 2007. The Company performs an annual assessment of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for Ameristar East Chicago, Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Additionally, the guidance requires an immediate impairment assessment if a change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
F-23
The goodwill related to the Company’s Missouri properties was assessed during the fourth quarter of 2011 using a qualitative analysis outlined in ASU No. 2011-08 to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would lead to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair values are less than the carrying amounts. Events and circumstances considered in this review included macroeconomic conditions, new competition, temporary road construction near our properties, financial performance of the reporting units and other financial and non-financial events. Based on these factors, the Company concluded the fair value of the Missouri properties was not more likely than not less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company was not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment analysis.
The Company also performed an annual impairment review of  Ameristar East Chicago’s indefinite-lived gaming license in the fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2010. These reviews did not result in any impairment charges related to the gaming license.
In addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar East Chicago’s goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of 2010. The permanent closure of a highway bridge near the East Chicago property during the fourth quarter of 2009 significantly adversely impacted forecasted financial results for the property. Closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient for many of Ameristar East Chicago’s guests and has significantly impacted the property’s business levels and operating results. This Ameristar East Chicago impairment assessment resulted in a total of 
$56.0 million
 of non-cash impairment charges, with 
$21.4 million
 relating to the goodwill and 
$34.6 million
 relating to the gaming license. The impairment charge completely eliminated the carrying value of the goodwill. The East Chicago gaming license was reduced to 
$12.6 million
. 
In 2009, the Company recorded a total of 
$111.7 million
 in non-cash impairment charges for the goodwill related to the East Chicago property acquisition. The 2009 reduction in the value of the goodwill was attributable to the significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets, as well as a lowering of the Company’s growth assumptions for the property to reflect its then-current operating performance (relative to the assumptions at the time of acquisition) and the decline in general economic conditions, as well as a result of the bridge closure described above.
Intangible assets initially recorded as part of the Ameristar East Chicago acquisition included a customer list with an estimated value of 
$0.4 million
 and an estimated useful life of 
five
 years and a trade name with an estimated value of 
$1.2 million
 and an estimated useful life of 
one
 year. The East Chicago gaming license, which has an indefinite life, is not amortized.
During the third quarter of 2010, in addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar St. Charles’ HOME nightclub service mark license due to the permanent closure of the nightclub. The impairment assessments performed resulted in a total of 
$0.2 million
 of impairment charges and completely eliminated the carrying value of the license. The license was acquired by the Company in 2009 to use certain trade names and other intellectual property related to the HOME nightclub at the St. Charles property.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, goodwill relating to the Missouri properties acquisition decreased 
$1.2 million
. Goodwill will continue to be reduced through 2016 by annual tax benefits of 
$1.2 million
 resulting from differences in the values assigned to certain purchased assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. 
The Company utilized Level 3 inputs as described in “Note 8 - Fair value measurements” to determine fair value relating to goodwill and intangible assets.
Note 14 — Commitments and contingencies
Litigation
. From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, most of which arises in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any litigation that management believes would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
East Chicago Local Development Agreement
. Pursuant to a Modified Local Development Agreement (the “Modified LDA”), for the period beginning June 3, 2011, Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC (“ACEC”) is required to pay 1.625% of its adjusted gross receipts from operation of the casino (“AGR”) to the City of East Chicago, Indiana (the “City”) and 1.625% of its AGR to Foundations of East Chicago, Inc., an Indiana not-for-profit corporation (“FEC”), to be used by the recipients solely to support and assist economic development in the City through specified initiatives set forth in the Modified LDA and for reasonable and necessary administrative expenses. The Modified LDA provides that ACEC will make the payments to separate and segregated bank accounts maintained by each recipient within 20 days after the last day of each calendar month; provided, however, that if directed by the Indiana Gaming Commission (the “IGC”), ACEC must make the payments to one or more held bank accounts. ACEC’s sole obligation under the Modified LDA is to make the economic development payments described above, and it has no obligation to monitor or enforce the proper use of the payments by the recipients, which is the duty of the IGC. The Modified LDA will continue in effect until the termination or expiration of the East Chicago riverboat gaming license or until any final and non-appealable order or other action is taken by the IGC to disapprove or terminate the Modified LDA. 
The Modified LDA modified and superseded in its entirety the prior local development agreement for the East Chicago 
F-24
casino (the “Prior LDA”), pursuant to which ACEC had been paying 2% of its AGR to FEC, 1% of its AGR to the City and 0.75% of its AGR to East Chicago Second Century, Inc., an Indiana corporation (“Second Century”), with the respective amounts payable to FEC and Second Century being deposited into two ACEC segregated bank accounts. On June 30, 2011, ACEC, the City, FEC and Second Century agreed in principle to accept the terms of the Modified LDA, allocate and distribute the funds in the two ACEC segregated bank accounts and dismiss with prejudice all pending claims against each other with respect to the Prior LDA and the Modified LDA. On September 29, 2011, the two lawsuits in which the Company was a defendant were dismissed with prejudice (except for certain claims not involving the Company). As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s East Chicago LDA liability was 
$0.7 million
 and 
$28.0 million
, respectively.
Self-Insurance Reserves.
 The Company is self-insured for various levels of general liability, workers’ compensation and employee health coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled 
$9.4 million
 and 
$10.8 million
, respectively. The Company considers historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities. The Company believes the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals; however, changes in health care costs, accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.
Guarantees.
 In December 2000, the Company assumed several agreements with the Missouri 210 Highway Transportation Development District (“Development District”) that had been entered into in order to assist the Development District in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the Ameristar Kansas City property prior to the Company’s purchase of that property. In order to pay for the highway improvement project, the Development District issued revenue bonds totaling 
$9.0 million
 with scheduled maturities from 2006 through 2011.
The Company has provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank in support of obligations of the Development District for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds. The amount outstanding under this letter of credit was 
$2.6 million
 as of December 31, 2011 and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds, as well as any costs incurred by the Development District that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders. Through December 31, 2011, the Company had paid 
$2.0 million
 in shortfalls and other costs. As required by the agreements, the Company anticipates that it will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the Development District from future available cash flow, as defined, and has recorded a corresponding receivable as of December 31, 2011.

The sum of the amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total for the year due to rounding.
(2)
 
Because earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per-share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total earnings (loss) per share amounts for the year.

In April 2011, the Company obtained 
$2.2 billion
 of new debt financing. A portion of the proceeds from the new debt financing was used to purchase 
26,150,000
 shares of ACI’s common stock held by the Estate. The share repurchase reduced the Company’s outstanding shares by approximately 
45%
. The reduction in the Company’s weighted-average shares outstanding from the Repurchase Transaction benefited 2011 diluted earnings per share by 
$0.54
.
(4)
 
As discussed in “Note 13 — Goodwill and other intangible assets,” the Company impaired a portion of the goodwill and gaming license acquired in the purchase of the East Chicago property. The pre-tax impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 totaled 
$56.0 million
. This charge adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by 
$0.56
.

If an Eligible Executive has elected not to participate in this Plan as provided hereinabove, such Eligible Executive shall not be entitled to any compensation or benefits under this Plan.

In the event that an Eligible Executive's employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries is terminated during the Protection Period by the Eligible Executive for Good Reason or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than Cause or the Eligible Executive's death or Disability, the Eligible Executive shall be entitled to, in lieu of any other severance or termination pay or benefits payable specifically as a result of a Change in Control or a termination of employment following a Change in Control, the following payments and benefits (subject to the terms and conditions hereof):
  
(a)
a lump-sum cash payment, payable, subject to Section 3.5, within ten (10) days following the Eligible Executive's last day of employment, equal to: 
(i)
if the Eligible Executive is a Corporate executive employed at the time of the Change in Control in a position above the Senior Vice President level, two (2) times the sum of the Eligible Executive's Base Salary and Target Bonus, plus an additional amount equal to the Eligible Executive's Target Bonus for the year in which the Termination Date occurs, prorated based on the number of calendar days in the final year that the Eligible Executive was employed by the Company;

(iv)
if the Eligible Executive is employed at the time of the Change in Control at the Corporate or property Vice President level (including as a property Assistant General Manager or an Interim or Acting Assistant General Manager), one (1) times the Eligible Executive's Base Salary. 
(b)
monthly cash payments for eighteen (18) months, in the case of Eligible Executives employed at the time of the Change in Control at the Corporate level as a Senior Vice President or above, or for twelve (12) months, in the case of all other Eligible Executives, following the Eligible Executive's last day of employment, commencing with the first month following the month in which the Termination Date occurs, equal to the monthly cost throughout the applicable continuation period (including both the employee and Company portions thereof) of continued participation by the Eligible Executive and his or her eligible dependents in the Company's primary and supplemental executive health benefit plans, as such plans were in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Such payments may, but need not, be applied by the Eligible Executive to pay for COBRA coverage or to purchase other coverage from another provider during any applicable continuation period.
All payments and benefits provided under this Section 3.3 are conditioned on the Eligible Executive's execution, prior to the payment of any such payments and benefits, of a separation agreement and general and special release of claims in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to such Eligible Executive's employment agreement with the Company or one of its subsidiaries or, if the Eligible Executive does not have such an employment agreement with the Company or one of its subsidiaries on the Termination Date, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit B hereto. 
 
Such separation agreement and general and special release of claims shall be provided to the Eligible Executive on the Termination Date.  The separation agreement and general and special release of claims shall be executed and delivered to the Company by the Eligible Executive within 21 days following the Termination Date.  Any payments scheduled to be made under this Section 3.3 prior to the date (the “Release Effective Date”) such separation agreement and general and special release of claims becomes effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms (which date shall be no later than the date that is 30 days following the Termination Date) shall be withheld and paid in lump sum on the Release Effective Date.
Section 3.4    
Tax Effect of Payments
.
(a)
Subject to Section 3.4(c), if, as a result of payments provided for under or pursuant to this Plan together with all other payments in the nature of compensation provided to or for the benefit of an Eligible Executive under any other agreement, plan or program in connection with a 280G Change in  Control (as defined below) (the “Total Payments”), the Eligible Executive becomes subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or any successor or comparable provision (the “Excise Tax”), then, in addition to any other benefits provided under or pursuant to this Plan or otherwise, the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall make a lump sum cash payment to the Eligible Executive at the time any such payments are made in an amount equal to the amount of any such taxes imposed or to be imposed on the Eligible Executive (the amount of any such payment, the “Parachute Tax Reimbursement”). In addition, the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall “gross up” such Parachute Tax Reimbursement by paying to the Eligible Executive at the same time an additional amount equal to the aggregate amount of any additional taxes (whether income taxes, excise taxes, special taxes, employment taxes or otherwise) that are or will be payable by the Eligible Executive as a result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement being paid or payable to the Eligible Executive and/or as a result of the 
additional amounts paid or payable to the Eligible Executive pursuant to this sentence, such that after payment of such additional taxes the Eligible Executive shall have been paid on a net after-tax basis an amount equal to the Parachute Tax Reimbursement. 
(b)
All mathematical determinations and all determinations that are required to be made under this Section 3.4 shall be made by an independent tax or accounting professional (meaning a firm that has not performed any services for the Company or its affiliates during the two years prior to the date of determination) retained by the Company to perform the tasks contemplated by this Section 3.4 (the “Tax Professional”), who shall provide its determination (the “Determination”), together with detailed supporting calculations, both to the Company and to the Eligible Executive promptly following the date of any 280G Change in  Control and in no event later than the date the first scheduled payment that could be subject to the Excise Tax is made, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Any Determination by the Tax Professional shall be binding upon the Company and the Eligible Executive, absent a binding determination by a governmental taxing authority that a greater or lesser amount of taxes is payable by the Eligible Executive. The Company shall pay the fees and costs of the Tax Professional.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 at the time of the initial determination by the Tax Professional hereunder, it is possible that Parachute Tax Reimbursement which will not have been made by the Company should have been made by the Company (“Underpayment”), or that Parachute Tax Reimbursement will have been made by the Company which should not have been made (“Overpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In either such event, the Tax Professional shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(c) and (d), in the event that the Eligible Executive is required by the Internal Revenue Service to make a payment of Excise Tax in excess of the amount of Excise Tax initially determined by the Tax Professional to be payable by the Eligible Executive, the Tax Professional shall determine the amount of the Underpayment of the related Parachute Tax Reimbursement initially made to or for the benefit of the Eligible Executive hereunder that has occurred, and any such Underpayment shall be paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Eligible Executive by no later than the due date by which such additional Excise Tax is required to be paid, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in any event by no later than December 31 of the year next following the year in which the additional Excise Tax and all other related taxes covered by the Underpayment are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities.  In the case of an Overpayment, the Eligible Executive shall, at the direction of the Company, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including, if reasonable, the filing of returns and claims for refund), and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company to correct such Overpayment; provided, however, that the Eligible Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Company an amount greater than the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment that he or she has retained or has recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities; and provided further, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses incurred by the Eligible Executive in connection with his or her taking of any such steps or otherwise cooperating with the Company to correct such Overpayment.
(c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4, if the Tax Professional determines that an Eligible Executive would be entitled to a Parachute Tax Reimbursement, but that the Total Payments do not exceed the amount that could be paid to the Eligible Executive without giving rise to any Excise Tax (such amount, the “Safe Harbor Amount”) by the lesser of (i) 10% of the Safe Harbor Amount or (ii) $100,000, then no Parachute Tax Reimbursement shall be paid to the Eligible Executive, and the Total Payments payable under this Plan to such Eligible Executive shall be reduced so that the Total Payments, in the aggregate, are equal to the Safe Harbor Amount.
(d)
Any reduction in an Eligible Executive's Payments required to be made pursuant to Paragraph 3.4(c) above (the “Required Reduction”) shall be made as follows: first, any  Payments  that became fully vested prior to the 280G Change in Control and that pursuant to paragraph (b) of  Treas. 
Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24 are treated as Payments solely by reason of the acceleration of their originally scheduled dates of payment shall be reduced, by cancellation of the acceleration of their dates of payment; second, any severance payments or benefits, performance-based cash or equity incentive awards, or other Payments the full amounts of which are treated as contingent on the 280G Change in Control pursuant to paragraph (a) of Treas. Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24,  shall be reduced; and third, any cash or equity incentive awards, or nonqualified deferred compensation amounts, that vest solely based on the Eligible Executive's  continued service with the Company or any of its affiliates, and that pursuant to paragraph (c) of Treas. Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24 are treated as contingent on the 280G Change in Control because they become vested as a result of the 280G Change in Control, shall be reduced,  first by cancellation of any acceleration of their originally scheduled dates of payment (if payment with respect to such items is not treated as automatically occurring upon the vesting of such items for purposes of Section 280G of the Code) and then, if necessary, by canceling the acceleration of their vesting. In each case, the amounts of the Payments shall be reduced in the inverse order of their originally scheduled dates of payment or vesting, as applicable, and shall be so reduced only to the extent necessary to achieve the Required Reduction. 
For purposes of this Section 3.4, “280G Change in  Control” shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, as determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, and “Payment” shall mean any payment or benefit in the nature of compensation that is to be paid or provided to an Eligible Executive or for his or her benefit in connection with a 280G Change in Control (whether under this Plan or otherwise, including by the entity, or by any affiliate of the entity, whose acquisition of the stock or assets of the Company or any of its affiliates constitutes the  280G Change in Control), if the Eligible Executive is a “disqualified individual” (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) at the time of the 280G Change in Control, to the extent that such payment or benefit is “contingent” on the 280G Change in Control within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.
Section 3.5    
Section 409A.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, to the extent that the Company reasonably determines in good faith that any payments or benefits to be provided hereunder to or for the benefit of an Eligible Executive who is also a “specified employee” (as such term is defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code or any successor or comparable provision) would be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any successor or comparable provision, the commencement of such payments and/or benefits shall be delayed until the earlier of (x) the date that is six months following the Eligible Executive's separation from service or (y) the date of the Eligible Executive's death.  Each of the payments that may be made under Section 3.3 are designated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Plan, with respect to payments of any amounts that are considered to be “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, references to “termination of employment” (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean “separation from service” as defined under Section 409A of the Code.

     In consideration of delivery to the Executive of the severance payments and benefits by the Company conditionally promised by the Company in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc.

     The Executive assumes the risk of any mistake of fact and of any facts which are unknown, and thereby waives any and all claims that this release does not extend to claims which the Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing this release, which if known by the Executive must or might have materially affected his or her settlement with the Company.  As of the date of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company is not aware of any employment-related claims that the Company may have against the Executive.

by this reference and which shall survive indefinitely. The Executive and the Company agree that no other agreements or covenants will be binding upon the parties unless set forth in a writing signed by the parties or their authorized representatives, and that each of the parties is authorized to make the representations and agreements herein set forth by or on behalf of each such party. The Executive and the Company each affirms that no promises have been made to or by either to the other except as set forth in the Plan or this Agreement. 
     The Executive acknowledges that he or she has had twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Agreement if he or she has wished to do so, that he or she has seven (7) days from the date of his or her acceptance of this Agreement within which to revoke his or her acceptance, that he or she has been and hereby is advised by the Company to consult with counsel concerning this Agreement and has had an opportunity to do so, and that no payments will be made to the Executive by the Company hereunder until after such seven (7) days and until the Executive shall have provided thereafter reasonable assurances on request that he or she has not revoked his or her acceptance of this Agreement within such seven (7) days. The Executive affirms that he or she enters into this Agreement freely and voluntarily.

ARTICLE 3
ELIGIBILITY AND BENEFITS
3.1
Eligible Executives.
  All Corporate- and property-level employees of the Company or its subsidiaries in the position of Director at the time of a Change in Control are eligible for benefits under this Plan (the “Eligible Executives”).  All compensation and benefits provided under the Plan shall be in lieu of, and not in addition to, any severance or other termination pay or benefits payable specifically as a result of a Change in Control or a termination of employment following a Change in Control and within the Protection Period provided for in any written employment agreement between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and a participating Eligible Executive.  Participation in this Plan shall not affect any other compensation or benefits provided for in any written employment agreement between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and an Eligible Executive and shall not affect an Eligible Executive's right to vested benefits such as accrued salary, accrued vacation or paid time off or vested retirement plan benefits.  
3.2
Single Trigger Change in Control Benefits.
  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in the applicable plan document or award agreement, all outstanding and unvested stock options and restricted stock held by each Eligible Executive shall become vested and non-forfeitable.  
3.3
Double Trigger Change in Control Benefits.
  In the event that an Eligible Executive's employment with the Company or one of its subsidiaries is terminated during the Protection Period by the Eligible Executive for Good Reason or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than Cause or the Eligible Executive's death or Disability, the Eligible Executive shall be entitled to, in lieu of any other severance or termination pay or benefits payable specifically as a result of a Change in Control or a termination of employment following a Change in Control, the following payments and benefits (subject to the terms and conditions hereof): 
(a)
a lump-sum cash payment, payable, subject to Section 3.5, within ten (10) days following the Eligible Executive's last day of employment, equal to one (1) times the Eligible Executive's Base Salary.
(b)
monthly cash payments for twelve (12) months following the Eligible Executive's last day of employment, commencing with the first month following the month in which the Termination 
Date occurs, equal to the monthly cost throughout the continuation period (including both the employee and Company portions thereof) of continued participation by the Eligible Executive and his or her eligible dependents in the Company's primary and supplemental executive health benefit plans, as such plans were in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control.  Such payments may, but need not, be applied by the Eligible Executive to pay for COBRA coverage or to purchase other coverage from another provider during any continuation period.
All payments and benefits provided under this Section 3.3 are conditioned on the Eligible Executive's execution, prior to the payment of any such payments and benefits, of a separation agreement and general and special release of claims in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to such Eligible Executive's employment agreement with the Company or one of its subsidiaries or, if the Eligible Executive does not have such an employment agreement with the Company or one of its subsidiaries on the Termination Date, in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A hereto.  Such separation agreement and general and special release of claims shall be provided to the Eligible Executive on the Termination Date. The separation agreement and general and special release of claims shall be executed and delivered to the Company by the Eligible Executive within 21 days following the Termination Date.  Any payments scheduled to be made under this Section 3.3 prior to the date (the “Release Effective Date”) such separation agreement and general and special release of claims becomes effective and irrevocable in accordance with its terms (which date shall be no later than the date that is 30 days following the Termination Date) shall be withheld and paid in lump sum on the Release Effective Date.
3.4
Tax Effect of Payments.
 
(a)
Subject to Section 3.4(c), if, as a result of payments provided for under or pursuant to this Plan together with all other payments in the nature of compensation provided to or for the benefit of an Eligible Executive under any other agreement, plan or program in connection with a 280G Change in Control (as defined below) (the “Total Payments”), the Eligible Executive becomes subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or any successor or comparable provision (the “Excise Tax”), then, in addition to any other benefits provided under or pursuant to this Plan or otherwise, the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall make a lump sum cash payment to the Eligible Executive at the time any such payments are made in an amount equal to the amount of any such taxes imposed or to be imposed on the Eligible Executive (the amount of any such payment, the “Parachute Tax Reimbursement”).  In addition, the Company (including any successor to the Company) shall “gross up” such Parachute Tax Reimbursement by paying to the Eligible Executive at the same time an additional amount equal to the aggregate amount of any additional taxes (whether income taxes, excise taxes, special taxes, employment taxes or otherwise) that are or will be payable by the Eligible Executive as a result of the Parachute Tax Reimbursement being paid or payable to the Eligible Executive and/or as a result of the additional amounts paid or payable to the Eligible Executive pursuant to this sentence, such that after payment of such additional taxes the Eligible Executive shall have been paid on a net after-tax basis an amount equal to the Parachute Tax Reimbursement.
(b)
All mathematical determinations and all determinations that are required to be made under this Section 3.4 shall be made by an independent tax or accounting professional (meaning a firm that has not performed any services for the Company or its affiliates during the two years prior to the date of determination) retained by the Company to perform the tasks contemplated by this Section 3.4 (the “Tax Professional”), who shall provide its determination (the “Determination”), together with detailed supporting calculations, both to the Company and to the Eligible Executive promptly following the date of any 280G Change in Control and in no event later than the date the first scheduled payment that could be subject to the Excise Tax is made, or such earlier time as is requested by the Company.  Any Determination by the Tax Professional shall be binding upon the Company and the Eligible Executive, 
absent a binding determination by a governmental taxing authority that a greater or lesser amount of taxes is payable by the Eligible Executive.  The Company shall pay the fees and costs of the Tax Professional.  As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 at the time of the initial determination by the Tax Professional hereunder, it is possible that Parachute Tax Reimbursement which will not have been made by the Company should have been made by the Company (“Underpayment”), or that Parachute Tax Reimbursement will have been made by the Company which should not have been made (“Overpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder.  In either such event, the Tax Professional shall determine the amount of the Underpayment or Overpayment that has occurred.  Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4(c) and (d), in the event that the Eligible Executive is required by the Internal Revenue Service to make a payment of Excise Tax in excess of the amount of Excise Tax initially determined by the Tax Professional to be payable by the Eligible Executive, the Tax Professional shall determine the amount of the Underpayment of the related Parachute Tax Reimbursement initially made to or for the benefit of the Eligible Executive hereunder that has occurred, and any such Underpayment shall be paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Eligible Executive by no later than the due date by which such additional Excise Tax is required to be paid, or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible, but in any event by no later than December 31 of the year next following the year in which the additional Excise Tax and all other related taxes covered by the Underpayment are remitted to the applicable taxing authorities.  In the case of an Overpayment, the Eligible Executive shall, at the direction of the Company, take such steps as are reasonably necessary (including, if reasonable, the filing of returns and claims for refund), and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Company to correct such Overpayment; provided, however, that the Eligible Executive shall not in any event be obligated to return to the Company an amount greater than the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment that he or she has retained or has recovered as a refund from the applicable taxing authorities; and provided further, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses incurred by the Eligible Executive in connection with his or her taking of any such steps or otherwise cooperating with the Company to correct such Overpayment.
(c)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.4, if the Tax Professional determines that an Eligible Executive would be entitled to a Parachute Tax Reimbursement, but that the Total Payments do not exceed the amount that could be paid to the Eligible Executive without giving rise to any Excise Tax (such amount, the “Safe Harbor Amount”) by the lesser of (i) 10% of the Safe Harbor Amount or (ii) $100,000, then no Parachute Tax Reimbursement shall be paid to the Eligible Executive, and the Total Payments payable under this Plan to such Eligible Executive shall be reduced so that the Total Payments, in the aggregate, are equal to the Safe Harbor Amount.
(d)
Any reduction in Eligible Executive's Payments required to be made pursuant to Paragraph 3.4(c) above (the “Required Reduction”) shall be made as follows: first, any  Payments  that became fully vested prior to the 280G Change in Control and that pursuant to paragraph (b) of  Treas. Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24 are treated as Payments solely by reason of the acceleration of their originally scheduled dates of payment shall be reduced, by cancellation of the acceleration of their dates of payment; second, any severance payments or benefits, performance-based cash or equity incentive awards, or other Payments the full amounts of which are treated as contingent on the 280G Change in Control pursuant to paragraph (a) of Treas. Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24,  shall be reduced; and third, any cash or equity incentive awards, or nonqualified deferred compensation amounts, that vest solely based on the Eligible Executive's  continued service with the Company or any of its affiliates, and that pursuant to paragraph (c) of Treas. Reg. §1.280G-1, Q/A 24 are treated as contingent on the 280G Change in Control because they become vested as a result of the 280G Change in Control, shall be reduced,  first by cancellation of any acceleration of their originally scheduled dates of payment (if payment with respect to such items is not treated as automatically occurring upon the vesting of such items for purposes of Section 280G of the 
Code) and then, if necessary, by canceling the acceleration of their vesting. In each case, the amounts of the Payments shall be reduced in the inverse order of their originally scheduled dates of payment or vesting, as applicable, and shall be so reduced only to the extent necessary to achieve the Required Reduction.
For purposes of this Section 3.4, “280G Change in  Control” shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, as determined in accordance with Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, and “Payment” shall mean any payment or benefit in the nature of compensation that is to be paid or provided to an Eligible Executive or for his or her benefit in connection with a 280G Change in Control (whether under this Plan or otherwise, including by the entity, or by any affiliate of the entity, whose acquisition of the stock or assets of the Company or any of its affiliates constitutes the  280G Change in Control), if the Eligible Executive is a “disqualified individual” (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) at the time of the 280G Change in Control, to the extent that such payment or benefit is “contingent” on the 280G Change in Control within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder. 
3.5
Section 409A.
  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, to the extent that the Company reasonably determines in good faith that any payments or benefits to be provided hereunder to or for the benefit of an Eligible Executive who is also a “specified employee” (as such term is defined under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code or any successor or comparable provision) would be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code or any successor or comparable provision, the commencement of such payments and/or benefits shall be delayed until the earlier of (x) the date that is six months following the Eligible Executive's separation from service or (y) the date of the Eligible Executive's death.  Each of the payments that may be made under Section 3.3 are designated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.  For purposes of this Plan, with respect to payments of any amounts that are considered to be “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, references to “termination of employment” (and substantially similar phrases) shall mean “separation from service” as defined under Section 409A of the Code.

Exhibit A
Form of Separation Agreement and General and Special Release
This Separation Agreement and General and Special Release (“Agreement”) is made by and between 
[name of eligible executive]
 (the “Executive”) and 
Ameristar Casinos, Inc.
, a Nevada corporation (“Company”), with respect to severance payments and benefits to be provided to the Executive conditioned in part on a complete release by the Executive of any and all employment-related claims against the Company and its affiliated entities, their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns.
In consideration of delivery to the Executive of the severance payments and benefits by the Company conditionally promised by the Company in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan for Director-Level Employees (the “Plan”), and with the sole exception of those obligations expressly recited herein or to be performed hereunder and of the Executive's claims to vested interests the Executive may have in employee benefit plans or programs, stock options or restricted stock as defined exclusively in written documents, the Executive and the Executive's heirs, successors and assigns do hereby and forever release and discharge the Company and its affiliated entities and their past and present directors, officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, representatives, successors and assigns from and against any and all causes of action, actions, judgments, liens, indebtedness, damages, losses, claims, liabilities and demands of whatsoever kind and character in any manner whatsoever arising prior to the date of this Agreement relating to the Executive's employment with the Company, including but not limited to any claim for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, breach of oral or written promise, allegedly unpaid compensation, wrongful termination, infliction of emotional distress, defamation, interference with contract relations or prospective economic advantage, negligence, misrepresentation or employment discrimination, and including without limitation, to the extent permitted by law, alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act) prohibiting discrimination based on age over 40, the Americans With Disabilities Act prohibiting discrimination based on disability, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Nevada Fair Employment Practices Act (NRS 613.010 et seq.), any state statutory wage claim under Chapter 608 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and any other federal, state or local labor or fair employment law under which a claim might be brought were it not released here, all as amended from time to time; but excluding any claims that the Executive has or may have, in his capacity as an officer, director, employee, agent, representative or manager, against the Company for indemnification, contribution or advancement of expenses pursuant to any contractual arrangements between the Executive and the Company or under the Company's organizational documents or applicable law.
The Executive assumes the risk of any mistake of fact and of any facts which are unknown, and thereby waives any and all claims that this release does not extend to claims which the Executive does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing this release, which if known by the Executive must or might have materially affected his or her settlement with the Company.  As of the date of the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, the Company is not aware of any employment-related claims that the Company may have against the Executive.
The Executive and the Company represent, understand and expressly agree that this Agreement sets forth all of the agreements, covenants and understandings of the parties, superseding all other prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements with respect to the termination or separation of the Executive's employment excepting only the Plan and the Company's Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Policy and  
Insider Trading Policy, which the Executive and the Company reaffirm and incorporate herein by this reference and which shall survive indefinitely.  The Executive and the Company agree that no other agreements or covenants will be binding upon the parties unless set forth in a writing signed by the parties or their authorized representatives, and that each of the parties is authorized to make the representations and agreements herein set forth by or on behalf of each such party.  The Executive and the Company each affirms that no promises have been made to or by either to the other except as set forth in the Plan or this Agreement.
The Executive acknowledges that he or she has had twenty-one (21) days within which to consider this Agreement if he or she has wished to do so, that he or she has seven (7) days from the date of his or her acceptance of this Agreement within which to revoke his or her acceptance, that he or she has been and hereby is advised by the Company to consult with counsel concerning this Agreement and has had an opportunity to do so, and that no payments will be made to the Executive by the Company hereunder until after such seven (7) days and until the Executive shall have provided thereafter reasonable assurances on request that he or she has not revoked his or her acceptance of this Agreement within such seven (7) days.  The Executive affirms that he or she enters into this Agreement freely and voluntarily.

In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, Stock dividend, Stock split, reverse Stock split, spin-off, split-up, split-off, extraordinary cash dividend, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, shall be made in the aggregate number and kind of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, the number and kind of shares or other property subject to outstanding awards and the amounts to be paid by award holders or the Company, as the case may be, with respect to outstanding awards; provided, however, that no such adjustment shall increase the aggregate value of any outstanding award.  In the event any change described in this Section 4.3 occurs and an adjustment is made in the outstanding awards, a similar adjustment shall be made in the maximum number and kind of shares covered by Stock Options and other awards that may be granted to any Participant pursuant to Section 3.2(c).
4.4

SECTION 5.  
Eligibility
.
Persons who are or who agree to become directors, officers, employees, consultants, advisers or independent contractors of the Company or a Related Company (including without limitation dealers, distributors and other business entities or persons providing services on behalf of the Company or a Related Company) are eligible to participate in the Plan.

.
6.1
    
The Stock Options awarded to officers and employees under the Plan may be of two types:  (i) Incentive Stock Options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision thereto (“Section 422”); and (ii) Non-Qualified Stock Options.  If any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option, or the Committee at the time of grant determines that any Stock Option shall be a Non-Qualified Stock Option, it shall constitute a Non-Qualified Stock Option.  Stock Options awarded to any Participant who is not an officer or employee of the Company or a Related Company shall be Non-Qualified Stock Options.
6.2
    
Subject to the following provisions, Stock Options awarded to Participants under the Plan 
shall be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine:
(a)
    
Option Price
.  The option price per share of Stock purchasable under a Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of award of the Stock Option.  For purposes of the Plan, Fair Market Value in relation to a share of the Stock means (i) if the Stock is publicly traded, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the Stock on the date in question or, if not available, on the trading date immediately following such date or (ii) if the Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 409A.
(b)
    
Option Term
.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, but shall in no event be longer than one hundred twenty (120) months after the date of grant of such Stock Option.
(c)
    
Exercisability
.  Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee.  The Committee may waive any exercise or vesting provisions contained in an award or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of outstanding Stock Options at any time in whole or in part.
(d)
    
Method of Exercise
.  Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option period by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares to be purchased, accompanied by payment of the purchase price.  Payment of the purchase price shall be made in such manner as the Committee may provide in the award, which may include cash (including cash equivalents), delivery of shares of Stock acceptable to the Committee already owned by the optionee or subject to awards hereunder, any other manner permitted by law as determined by the Committee, or any combination of the foregoing.  The Committee may provide that all or part of the shares received upon the exercise of a Stock Option which are paid for using Restricted Stock shall be restricted in accordance with the original terms of the award in question.
(e)
    
No Stockholder Rights
.  An optionee shall have no rights to dividends or other rights of a stockholder with respect to shares subject to a Stock Option until the optionee has given written notice of exercise and has paid for such shares, and the optionee has been duly recorded as the owner of the shares on the books of the Company.
(f)
    
Surrender Rights
.  The Committee may provide that Stock Options may be surrendered for cash upon any terms and conditions set by the Committee.
(g)
    
Non-Transferability; Limited Transferability
.  A Stock Option agreement may permit an optionee to transfer the Stock Option to his or her children, grandchildren or spouse (“Immediate Family”), to one or more trusts for the benefit of such Immediate Family members, or to one or more partnerships or limited liability companies in which such Immediate Family members are the only partners or members if (i) the agreement setting forth such Stock Option expressly provides that such Stock Option may be transferred only with the express written consent of the Committee and (ii) the optionee does not receive any consideration in any form whatsoever for such transfer other than the receipt of an interest in the trust, partnership or limited liability company to which the Stock Option is transferred.  Any Stock Option so transferred shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such Stock Option immediately prior to the transfer thereof.  Any Stock 
Option not (x) granted pursuant to any agreement expressly allowing the transfer of such Stock Option or (y) amended expressly to permit its transfer shall not be transferable by the optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and such Stock Option shall be exercisable during the optionee's lifetime only by the optionee.
(h)
    
Termination of Relationship
.  If an optionee's employment or other qualifying relationship with the Company or a Related Company terminates by reason of death, disability, retirement, voluntary or involuntary termination or otherwise, the Stock Option shall be exercisable to the extent determined by the Committee; provided, however, that unless employment or such other qualifying relationship is terminated for cause (as may be defined by the Committee in connection with the grant of any Stock Option), the Stock Option shall remain exercisable (to the extent that it was otherwise exercisable on the date of termination) for (A) at least six (6) months from the date of termination if termination was caused by death or disability or (B) at least ninety (90) days from the date of termination if termination was caused by other than death or disability, but in no event beyond the option term fixed pursuant to Section 6.2(b).  To the extent permitted under Section 409A, the Committee may provide that, notwithstanding the option term fixed pursuant to Section 6.2(b), a Stock Option which is outstanding on the date of an optionee's death shall remain outstanding for an additional period after the date of such death.
(i)
    
Option Grants to Participants Subject to Section 16
.  If for any reason any Stock Option granted to a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act is not approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act or any successor rule (“Rule 16b-3”), neither the Stock Option (except upon its exercise) nor the Stock underlying the Stock Option may be disposed of by the Participant until six months have elapsed following the date of grant of the Stock Option, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition.
6.3
    
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2, no Incentive Stock Option shall (i) have an option price which is less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of the award of the Stock Option (or less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date of award of the Stock Option if the Participant owns, or would be considered to own by reason of Section 424(d) of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision thereto, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company at the time of the grant of the Stock Option), (ii) be exercisable more than ten (10) years after the date such Incentive Stock Option is awarded (five (5) years after the date of award if the Participant owns, or would be considered to own by reason of Section 424(d) of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor provision thereto, more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary of the Company at the time of the grant of the Stock Option), (iii) be awarded more than ten (10) years after the effective date of the Plan or (iv) be transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  In addition, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time a Stock Option is granted) of Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant in any calendar year (under the Plan and any other plans of the Company or any subsidiary or parent corporation) shall not exceed $100,000.  
SECTION 7.  
Restricted Stock
.
Subject to the following provisions, all awards of Restricted Stock to Participants shall be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine:
(a)
    
The Restricted Stock award shall specify the number of shares of Restricted Stock to be awarded, the price, if any, to be paid by the recipient of the Restricted Stock and the date or dates on which, or the conditions upon the satisfaction of which, the Restricted Stock will vest.  The vesting of Restricted Stock may be conditioned upon the completion of a specified period of service with the Company or a Related Company, upon the attainment of specified performance goals or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine.  
(b)
    
Stock certificates representing the Restricted Stock awarded to an employee shall be registered in the Participant's name, but the Committee may direct that such certificates be held by the Company on behalf of the Participant.  Except as may be permitted by the Committee, no share of Restricted Stock may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Participant until such share has vested in accordance with the terms of the Restricted Stock award.  At the time Restricted Stock vests, a certificate for such vested shares shall be delivered to the Participant (or his or her designated beneficiary in the event of death), free of all restrictions.
(c)
    
The Committee may provide that the Participant shall have the right to vote or receive dividends, or both, on Restricted Stock.  Unless the Committee provides otherwise, Stock received as a dividend on, or in connection with a stock split of, Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock.
(d)
    
Except as may be provided by the Committee, in the event of a Participant's termination of employment or other qualifying relationship with the Company or a Related Company before all of his or her Restricted Stock has vested, or in the event any conditions to the vesting of Restricted Stock have not been satisfied prior to any deadline for the satisfaction of such conditions set forth in the award, the shares of Restricted Stock which have not vested shall be forfeited, and the Committee may provide that the lower of (i) any purchase price paid by the Participant and (ii) the Restricted Stock's aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of forfeiture shall be paid in cash to the Participant.
(e)
    
The Committee may waive, in whole or in part, any or all of the conditions to receipt of, or restrictions with respect to, any or all of the Participant's Restricted Stock.
(f)
    
If for any reason any Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act is not approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3, the Restricted Stock may not be disposed of by the Participant until six months have elapsed following the date of award of the Restricted Stock, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition.
SECTION 8.  
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units.
Subject to the following provisions, all awards of Restricted Stock Units (sometimes referred to herein as “RSUs”) and Performance Share Units (sometimes referred to herein as “PSUs”) shall be in such form and shall have such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine:
(a)
    
The Restricted Stock Unit or Performance Share Unit award shall specify the number of RSUs or PSUs to be awarded and the duration of the period (the “Deferral Period”) during which, and the conditions under which, receipt of the Stock will be deferred.  The Committee may condition the grant or vesting of Restricted Stock Units, or receipt of Stock or cash at the end of the Deferral Period, upon the completion of a specified period of service 
with the Company or a Related Company, upon the attainment of specified performance goals or upon such other criteria as the Committee may determine.  RSUs whose grant or vesting is in whole or in part conditioned on the attainment of specified performance goals may be referred to as PSUs.  
(b)
    
Except as may be provided by the Committee, RSU and PSU awards may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered by the Participant during the Deferral Period.
(c)
    
At the expiration of the Deferral Period, the Participant (or his or her designated beneficiary in the event of death) shall receive (i) certificates for the number of shares of Stock equal to the number of shares covered by the RSU or PSU award, (ii) cash equal to the Fair Market Value of such Stock or (iii) a combination of shares and cash, as the Committee may determine.
(d)
    
Except as may be provided by the Committee, in the event of a Participant's termination of employment or other qualifying relationship with the Company or a Related Company before the RSU or PSU has vested, his or her RSU or PSU award shall be forfeited.
(e)
    
The Committee may waive, in whole or in part, any or all of the conditions to receipt of, or restrictions with respect to, Stock or cash under a Restricted Stock Unit award or Performance Share Unit award.  However, the Committee shall not accelerate the payment of an RSU or PSU if such acceleration would violate Section 409A.  
(f)
    
If for any reason any RSU or PSU awarded to a Participant subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act is not approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3, the shares issuable with respect to such RSU or PSU may not be disposed of by the Participant until six months have elapsed following the date of award of the RSU or PSU, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition.
SECTION 9.

the performance goals shall be objective and the achievement of such performance goals shall be substantially uncertain (within the meaning of Section 162(m)) at the time the performance goals are established; 
(c)
    
the amount of the award payable upon each level of achievement of the performance goals must be objectively determinable, except that the Committee shall have the right to reduce (but not increase) the amount payable, in its sole discretion; and
(d)
    
prior to payment of any award, the Committee shall certify in writing, in a manner which satisfies the requirements of Section 162(m), that the performance goals have been satisfied.
SECTION 10.

SECTION 11.  
Tax Withholding
.
11.1
    
Each Participant shall, no later than the date as of which the value of an award first becomes 
includible in such person's gross income for applicable tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee (which may include delivery of shares of Stock already owned by the optionee or subject to awards hereunder) regarding payment of, any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the award.  The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company) shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Participant.
11.2
    
To the extent permitted by the Committee, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may provide, a Participant may elect to have the minimum withholding tax obligation with respect to any awards hereunder satisfied by (i) having the Company withhold shares of Stock otherwise deliverable to such person with respect to the award or (ii) delivering to the Company unrestricted shares of Stock.
 
 
SECTION 12.  
Amendments and Termination
.
No awards may be granted under the Plan more than ten (10) years after the date of approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company, which was June 3, 2009.  No award intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Section 162(m) (other than Stock Options) shall be granted after the first stockholder meeting that occurs in the fifth year after the most recent stockholder approval of the material terms of the performance goals under the Plan.
The Board may terminate the Plan at any earlier time and may amend it from time to time, in each case after consideration of the consequences under Section 409A.  No amendment or termination of the Plan shall adversely affect any award previously granted without the award holder's written consent.  Amendments may be made without stockholder approval except (i) if and to the extent necessary to satisfy any applicable mandatory legal or regulatory requirements (including the requirements of any stock exchange or over-the-counter market on which the Stock is listed or qualified for trading and any requirements imposed under any state securities laws or regulations as a condition to the registration of securities distributable under the Plan or otherwise) or (ii) as required for the Plan to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m), Section 422 or any other non-mandatory legal or regulatory requirements if the Board deems it desirable for the Plan to satisfy any such requirements.
SECTION 13.  
Acceleration of Vesting in Certain Circumstances
.
13.1
    
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Committee and expressly set forth in the agreement evidencing an award, in the event of a Change in Control, (i) each Stock Option outstanding under the Plan which is not otherwise fully vested or exercisable with respect to all of the shares of Stock at that time subject to such Stock Option shall automatically accelerate so that each such Stock Option shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the shares of Stock at the time subject to such Stock Option and may be exercised for any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Stock and (ii) all shares of Restricted Stock and all RSU and PSU awards outstanding under the Plan which are not otherwise fully vested shall automatically accelerate so that all such shares of Restricted Stock and RSU and PSU awards shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become fully vested, free of all restrictions.  In addition, to the extent permitted under Section 409A, the Committee may, in the award agreement or otherwise, accelerate the payment date of all or any portion of a Participant's RSU and PSU awards upon or after a Change in Control.  
13.2
    
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Committee and expressly set forth in the agreement evidencing an award, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, (i) each Stock Option outstanding under the Plan which is not otherwise fully vested or 
exercisable with respect to all of the shares of Stock at that time subject to such Stock Option shall automatically accelerate so that each such Stock Option shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all the shares of Stock at the time subject to such Stock Option and may be exercised for any or all of those shares as fully vested shares of Stock, and (ii) all shares of Restricted Stock and all RSU and PSU awards outstanding under the Plan which are not otherwise fully vested shall automatically accelerate so that all such shares of Restricted Stock and RSU and PSU awards shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become fully vested, free of all restrictions.  In addition, to the extent permitted under Section 409A, the Committee may, in the award agreement or otherwise, accelerate the payment date of all or any portion of a Participant's RSU and PSU awards immediately prior to or upon or after a Corporate Transaction.

13.4
    
As used in the Plan, a “Change in Control” shall be deemed to have occurred if:
(a)
    
Individuals who, as of January 30, 2009, constitute the entire Board (“Incumbent Directors”) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to such date whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders, was approved by the vote of a majority of the then Incumbent Directors (other than an election or nomination of an individual whose assumption of office is the result of an actual or threatened election contest relating to the election of directors of the Company), also shall be an Incumbent Director; or
(b)
    
Any Person (as defined below) other than a Permitted Holder (as defined below) shall become the beneficial owner (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing in the aggregate fifty percent (50%) or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of Stock or (ii) the Combined Voting Power (as defined below) of all then outstanding Voting Securities (as defined below) of the Company; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this clause (b) solely as the result of:  
(A)
An acquisition of securities by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares of Stock or other Voting Securities outstanding, increases (i) the proportionate number of shares of Stock beneficially owned by any Person to fifty percent (50%) or more of the shares of Stock then outstanding or (ii) the proportionate voting power represented by the Voting Securities beneficially owned by any Person to fifty percent (50%) or more of the Combined Voting Power of all then outstanding Voting Securities; or 
(B)
An acquisition of securities directly from the Company, except that this Paragraph (B) shall not apply to:
(1)
any conversion of a security that was not acquired directly from the Company; or
(2)
any acquisition of securities if the Incumbent Directors at the time of the 
initial approval of such acquisition would not immediately after (or otherwise as a result of) such acquisition constitute a majority of the Board.
13.5
    
As used in the Plan, “Corporate Transaction” means (a) any merger, consolidation or recapitalization of the Company (or, if the capital stock of the Company is affected, any subsidiary of the Company), or any sale, lease or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of transactions contemplated or arranged by any party as a single plan) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (each of the foregoing being an “Acquisition Transaction”) where (i) the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such Acquisition Transaction would not immediately after such Acquisition Transaction beneficially own, directly or indirectly, shares representing in the aggregate more than fifty percent (50%) of (A) the then outstanding common stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger, consolidation or recapitalization or acquiring such assets of the Company, as the case may be (the “Surviving Corporation”) (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any) and (B) the Combined Voting Power of the then outstanding Voting Securities of the Surviving Corporation (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any) or (ii) the Incumbent Directors at the time of the initial approval of such Acquisition Transaction would not immediately after such Acquisition Transaction constitute a majority of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation (or of its ultimate parent corporation, if any) or (b) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.
13.6
    
For purposes of this Section 13: 
(a)
    
“Combined Voting Power” shall mean the aggregate votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors of a corporation by holders of the then outstanding Voting Securities of such corporation;
(b)
    
“Permitted Holder” shall mean (i) the Company or any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company, (ii) to the extent they hold securities in any capacity whatsoever, the Estate of Craig H. Neilsen, deceased, and the heirs, ancestors, lineal descendants, stepchildren, legatees and legal representatives of Craig H.

In addition, in connection with the granting or exercising of, or delivery of shares of Stock under, any award under the Plan, the Committee may require the recipient to agree not to dispose of any Stock issuable in connection with such award, except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, if the Committee determines such agreement is necessary or desirable in connection with any requirement or interpretation of any federal or state securities law, rule or regulation.

THIS AGREEMENT is made as of the Date of Grant set forth above, between AMERISTAR CASINOS, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the “Company”), and the optionee named above (hereinafter called the “Optionee”). 
RECITALS
The Committee (as defined below) responsible for administering the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), has determined that it is to the advantage and interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant, pursuant to the Plan, the option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the service of the Company or Related Company (as defined for purposes of the Plan) and to reward extraordinary effort during such service. 
As used herein, the term “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee or such other committee of directors appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company to administer the Plan, or, if no committee has been appointed for such purpose, reference to the “Committee” shall be deemed a reference to the Board of Directors of the Company. If the Optionee is not a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the term “Committee” shall extend to and include any officer of the Company to which the Committee has properly delegated any of its authorities to administer the Plan. 
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1.
 
Grant of Option
. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase on the terms and conditions set forth herein all or any part of an aggregate of the number of shares (the “Shares”) of the Common Stock of the Company (whether authorized and unissued or treasury shares) identified above next to the heading “No. of Shares” at the purchase price per Share identified above next to the heading “Exercise Price” as the Optionee may, from time to time, elect. The Option shall vest and become exercisable on a cumulative basis in an amount equal to 25% per year for four years beginning on the day before the anniversary of the Date of Grant, as described in the vesting schedule set forth above under the heading “Vesting Schedule.”  The Option shall expire on the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date” unless terminated sooner in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 below. 
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the Optionee's employment or other Relationship at any time, with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the Optionee's compensation from the rate in existence at the time the Option is granted. As used herein, the term “Relationship” shall mean that the Optionee is or has agreed to become an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser or independent contractor of the Company or any Related Company. 
2.
Term of Option
. The right to exercise the Option granted hereunder, to the extent unexercised, shall remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the grant of this Option, unless another date is specified in Section 1 hereof or unless sooner terminated in accordance with Section 5 hereof. 
3.
Method of Exercise
. 
(a)
To the extent that the Option has become exercisable hereunder, the Option may be exercised from time to time by written notice to the Company stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, together with payment in full of the purchase price therefor. Payment of the purchase price for such Shares shall be made (i) in cash, (ii) by certified or cashier's check payable to the order of the Company, (iii) in other cash equivalents acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, (iv) in the Committee's sole discretion, by delivery of shares of the Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee or subject to vested stock options under the Plan, subject to such delivery 
being permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, including without limitation Section 78.288 thereof, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. If requested by the Committee, prior to the delivery of any Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a representation that the Shares are not being acquired with a view to distribution and will be sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. As soon after the notice of exercise as the Company is reasonably able to comply, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax to the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option, deliver to the Optionee or such other person, at the principal office of the Company or such other place as shall be mutually acceptable, a certificate or certificates for the Shares being purchased. 
(b)
If payment is made with shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee, the Optionee, or other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall deliver to the Company with the notice of exercise certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock in payment for the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company. In addition, if requested by the Committee, prior to the acceptance of such certificates in payment for the Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a written representation and warranty that he or she has good and marketable title to the shares represented by the certificate(s), free and clear of liens and encumbrances. The value of the shares of Common Stock so tendered in payment for the Shares being purchased shall be their Fair Market Value Per Share (as defined below) on the date of the Optionee's notice of exercise. 
(c)
If payment is to be made in shares of Common Stock subject to vested stock options under the Plan, the per share value attributable to the shares underlying the stock option(s) to be surrendered or canceled shall be the Fair Market Value Per Share of such shares less the exercise price per share of such option(s). The Company and the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall execute and deliver such instruments or modifications of stock options as shall be necessary to give effect to such an exercise of the Option. 
(d)
If for any reason a purported exercise of the Option providing for payment to be made in whole or in part through the delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned or underlying vested stock options is rejected by the Committee or is otherwise not permitted, such purported exercise shall not be effective unless, following notice thereof from the Company, the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option promptly pays the exercise price in an acceptable form. 
(e)
If the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option desires to exercise the Option with funds borrowed from a broker-dealer in a margin transaction under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and such method of exercise is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, the Optionee's notice of exercise may be delivered to the Company by such broker-dealer and the Company may deliver the certificate(s) for the Shares being purchased to such broker-dealer on behalf of the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option. 
(f)
For purposes hereof, the “Fair Market Value Per Share” of the Company's Common Stock shall mean (i) if the Common Stock is publicly traded, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the Common Stock on the date in question or, if not available, on the trading date immediately following such date or (ii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”). 
(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of 
exercise of the Option or the delivery of the Shares for such period as may be required for the Company with reasonable diligence (i) to comply with any applicable listing, registration or qualification requirements of any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market or under any federal or state law or (ii) to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body. In addition, in connection with any exercise of the Option, the Committee may require the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option to agree not to dispose of any of the Shares acquired upon exercise thereof except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions which the Committee, in its sole discretion, then deems necessary or desirable in connection with any then existing and effective requirement or interpretation of any applicable federal or state securities law, rule or regulation. 
(h)
The Option may be exercised for less than the total number of Shares for which the Option is then exercisable, provided that a partial exercise may not be for less than 100 Shares, except in the final year of the term of the Option, and shall not, in any event, include any fractional Shares. 
4.
Tax Withholding
. The Optionee shall, no later than the date as of which any value attributed to the Option first becomes includible in the Optionee's gross income for applicable tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee (which in the sole discretion of the Committee may include delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee or subject to awards under the Plan subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(b) or Section 3(c), as applicable) regarding payment of, any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect thereto, to enable the Company to claim a deduction in connection with the exercise of the Option or otherwise to satisfy any legal requirements. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 
5.
Termination of Option; Acceleration of Vesting upon Death or Permanent Disability
. 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5, if the Optionee ceases to have a Relationship for any reason other than the Optionee's death or Permanent Disability (as defined in Section 5(c)), the Option shall terminate 90 days from the date on which such Relationship terminates unless the Optionee has resumed or initiated a Relationship and has a Relationship on such date. During such 90-day period, the Optionee may exercise the Option but only to the extent the Option was exercisable on the date of termination of the Optionee's Relationship and provided that the Option has not expired in accordance with Section 2 or otherwise terminated as provided herein. A leave of absence approved in writing by or on behalf of the Committee shall not be deemed a termination of Relationship for purposes of this Section 5, but the Option may not be exercised during any such leave of absence, except during the first 90 days thereof.  
In the event that the Relationship as an employee is terminated by the Optionee for Good Reason (as defined below) or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 5(c)) or the Optionee's death or Permanent Disability, the above-described 90-day period shall be extended to six months following such termination.  For purposes of this Section 5(a), “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in or for purposes of a written employment agreement in effect as of the date of termination between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the Optionee, or if “Good Reason” is not defined in or for purposes of any such employment agreement or no such employment agreement is in effect as of the date of termination, 
“Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended (regardless of whether the Optionee is a participant in such plan).
In the event that the Relationship is terminated by the Optionee's Retirement (as defined below), the Option, if granted at least one (1) year prior to the date of Retirement, shall continue to vest as described in Section 1 hereof and shall terminate only upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of Retirement or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 5(a), “Retirement” means the termination of the Optionee's service with the Company or a Related Company as an employee for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 5(c)), death or Permanent Disability (as defined in Section 5(c)) after the Optionee has (i) obtained at least 75 Points (as defined below), (ii) attained at least 60 years of age and (iii) completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.  The Optionee's “Points” shall be equal the sum of the Optionee's age (full years only) and full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Relationship is terminated for cause, the Option shall terminate upon the termination of the Relationship. 
(b)
If the Optionee shall die at a time when the Optionee is in a Relationship or if the Optionee shall cease to have a Relationship by reason of Permanent Disability, any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall immediately become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of death or termination of the Relationship by reason of Permanent Disability or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”     In the case of death, the Option may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
(c)
As used herein, the term “Permanent Disability” shall mean termination of a Relationship with the Company or any Related Company with the consent of the Company or such Related Company by reason of permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As used herein, the term “for cause” shall mean that the Relationship is terminated by the Company or a Related Company due to (i) the commission by the Optionee of a substantial violation, through intentional conduct or through a pattern of behavior not corrected within a reasonable period of time after written notice to the Optionee by the Company or such Related Company of such behavior (in either case, whether by action or omission), of the Optionee's duties on behalf of the Company or a Related Company or the workplace policies or rules of the Company or a Related Company which conduct or behavior actually results in substantial harm to the Company or a Related Company or could reasonably be expected to put personnel of the Company or a Related Company in serious jeopardy of imminent harm to their safety, health or well-being or to cause substantial harm to the business of the Company or a Related Company or (ii) the commission by the Optionee of any act(s) or omission(s) constituting dishonesty, a felony or fraud or (iii) the failure of the Optionee to satisfy any requirements under applicable gaming laws or regulations for the continuance of the 
Optionee's Relationship with the Company or such Related Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event of any conflict between the definition of “for cause” set forth above and the definition of “for cause” or “cause” in any employment agreement the Optionee may have with the Company or a Related Company, the definition and other provisions concerning the determination of “for cause” or “cause” in such employment agreement shall control. For purposes of the Option, whether a Relationship is or has been terminated “for cause” shall be finally determined by the Committee. 
6.
Adjustments
. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, split-off, extraordinary cash dividend, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Company's Common Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, shall be made in the number and kind of shares or other property subject to the Option and the exercise price under the Option; provided, however, that no such adjustment or substitution shall increase the aggregate value of the Option and no such adjustment or substitution shall result in the Company being required to sell or issue any fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment or substitution shall be made with respect to the Option pursuant to this Section 6 that would cause the Option, or any other option granted in substitution for the Option, to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
7.
Change in Control; Corporate Transaction
. In the event of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company. In the event of a Corporate Transaction (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company.  In addition, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation), or upon a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company, the Committee may take such action as it in its discretion deems appropriate to (i) cash out the Option at or immediately prior to the date of such event (based on the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time) and/or (ii) provide that the Option shall be exercisable for a period of at least 10 business days from the date of receipt of a notice from the Company of such proposed event, following the expiration of which period any unexercised portion of the Option shall terminate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no period of exercisability of the Option shall be provided pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence that would cause the Option to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
8.
Provisions Regarding Transferability
. The Optionee may transfer the Option to the Optionee's children, grandchildren or spouse (“Immediate Family”), to one or more trusts for the benefit of the Optionee's Immediate Family members, or to one or more partnerships or limited liability companies in which such Immediate Family members are the only partners or members only upon the express written consent of the Committee, and provided the Optionee does not receive any consideration in any form whatsoever for such transfer other than the receipt of an interest in the trust, partnership or limited liability company to which the Option is transferred. Upon any such 
transfer of the Option, the Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option immediately prior to the transfer thereof. Except as expressly provided in the first sentence of this Section 8, the Option is not assignable or transferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. 
9.
No Stockholder Rights
. The Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject hereto until the Optionee or such person has become the holder of record of such Shares, and no adjustment (except such adjustments as may be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 6 hereof) shall be made for dividends or distributions of rights in respect of such Shares if the record date is prior to the date on which the Optionee or such person becomes the holder of record. 
10.
Investment Representation
. The Optionee hereby represents that the Option and any Shares purchased hereunder are being acquired for the Optionee's own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof except as may be permitted by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
11.
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO ISSUE OR DELIVER SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION BY THE COMPANY OF ANY REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES UNDER ANY STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW OR RULINGS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY BODY OR THE MAKING OF SUCH INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS BY THE OPTIONEE (OR ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION) IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES WHICH THE COMMITTEE SHALL, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE. SUCH REQUIRED REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS THAT THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, (A) IS NOT PURCHASING SUCH SHARES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND (B) AGREES TO HAVE PLACED UPON THE FACE AND/OR REVERSE OF ANY CERTIFICATES FOR SUCH SHARES A LEGEND SETTING FORTH ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE OR A REFERENCE THERETO AND STATING THAT, PRIOR TO MAKING ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY SUCH SHARES, THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, WILL GIVE THE COMPANY NOTICE OF INTENTION TO SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE SHARES NOT LESS THAN FIVE DAYS PRIOR TO SUCH SALE OR DISPOSITION. 
12.
Optionee Subject to Section 16
. If the Optionee is a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and if for any reason the Option has not been approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, neither the Option (except upon its exercise) nor the Common Stock underlying the Option may be disposed of by the Optionee until six months have elapsed following the date of grant of the Option, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition. 
13.
Acceptance of Agreement
. By accepting the Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, without the necessity of the Optionee signing this Agreement. The Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the acceptance of the Option constitutes satisfaction in full of any and all pre-existing understandings or commitments between the Company and the Optionee relating to the Optionee's right to acquire equity securities of the Company. 
14.
Plan Terms
. The Option shall be subject to and governed by the terms and provisions of the Plan, which by this reference are incorporated herein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. All determinations and interpretations thereof made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto and upon their successors and assigns.

Dear Ameristar Team Member: 
This letter agreement (the “Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions applicable to the Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) which have been granted to you by Ameristar Casinos, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), pursuant to its 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). Your award is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan and this Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Plan. 
1.
Grant of RSUs
You have been granted the number of RSUs set forth under the heading “No. of RSUs” on the cover page of this Agreement. 
 
Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) on the applicable settlement date for the RSU. You do not need to pay any purchase price to receive the RSUs granted to you by this Agreement. 
2.
Vesting of RSUs
Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 2, your RSUs will vest in installments as set forth under the heading “Vesting Schedule” on the cover page of this Agreement, provided that you are an employee of or have another Relationship with the Company or one of its Related Companies on each such respective date.  
As used herein, the term “Relationship” means that you are or have agreed to become an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser or independent contractor of the Company or a Related Company.
If your Relationship terminates for any reason other than Retirement (as defined below), death or Permanent Disability (as defined below), any of your RSUs that have not vested prior to the termination of your Relationship will be forfeited. 
If your Relationship terminates by reason of Retirement, your RSUs, if granted at least one (1) year prior to the date of Retirement, shall continue to vest as described above.  For purposes of this Section 2, “Retirement” means the termination of your Relationship with the Company or a Related Company as an employee for any reason other than cause, death or Permanent Disability after you have (i) obtained at least 75 Points (as defined below), (ii) attained at least 60 years of age and (iii) completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.  Your “Points” shall be equal the sum of your age (full years only) and full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.
As used herein, the term “cause” shall mean that the Relationship is terminated by the Company or a Related Company due to (i) your commission of a substantial violation, through intentional conduct or through a pattern of behavior not corrected within a reasonable period of time after written notice to you by the Company or such Related Company of such behavior (in either case, whether by action or omission), of your duties on behalf of the Company or a Related Company or the workplace policies or rules of the Company or a Related Company which conduct or behavior actually results in substantial harm to the Company or a Related Company or could reasonably be expected to put personnel of the Company or a Related Company in serious jeopardy of imminent harm to their safety, health or well-being or to cause substantial harm to the business of the Company or a Related Company or (ii) your commission of any act(s) or omission(s) constituting dishonesty, a felony or fraud or (iii) your failure to satisfy any requirements under applicable gaming laws or regulations for the continuance of your Relationship with the Company or such Related Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in 
the event of any conflict between the definition of “cause” set forth above and the definition of “for cause” or “cause” in any employment agreement you may have with the Company or a Related Company, the definition and other provisions concerning the determination of  “for cause” or “cause” in such employment agreement shall control. As used herein, whether a Relationship is or has been terminated for “cause” shall be finally determined by the Committee.
If you die at a time when you are in a Relationship, or if you cease to have a Relationship by reason of Permanent Disability, any portion of your RSUs that have not otherwise vested shall automatically accelerate so that all such RSUs shall immediately become vested.  As used herein, the term “Permanent Disability” shall mean termination of your Relationship with the Company or any Related Company with the consent of the Company or such Related Company by reason of your permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
3.
Settlement of RSUs; Delivery of Shares
Your RSUs will be settled on, or within 30 days after, their vesting dates as set forth in Section 2 or 4. On the settlement date of an RSU, the Company will deliver to you one share of Common Stock for each of your RSUs being settled on such date. The Common Stock delivered upon the settlement of your RSUs will be fully transferable (subject to any applicable securities law restrictions) and not subject to forfeiture. 
4.
Change in Control; Corporate Transaction
     In the event of a Change in Control, any portion of your RSUs that have not otherwise vested shall automatically accelerate to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”) so that all such RSUs shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become vested. In the event of a Corporate Transaction, any portion of your RSUs that have not otherwise vested shall automatically accelerate to the extent permitted by Section 409A so that all such RSUs shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become vested. Your RSUs that vest under this Section 4 will be settled on or within 30 days after the vesting date.    In addition, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation), or upon a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company, the Committee may take such action as it in its discretion deems appropriate, to the extent permitted by Section 409A, to cash out your RSUs at or immediately prior to the date of such event (based on the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time).
5.
Income Tax Withholding
You must make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to satisfy any applicable federal, state or local tax withholding liability arising with respect to your RSUs at the time such liability arises. You can either make a cash payment to the Company of the required amount or you can elect to satisfy your withholding obligation by having the Company withhold from the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of your RSUs a number of shares of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole share) necessary to satisfy the minimum amount of your withholding obligation. If you fail to satisfy your withholding obligation in cash on or before the settlement date of your RSUs, the Company will withhold shares of Common Stock deliverable upon settlement of your RSUs toward satisfaction of your withholding obligation. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall have the right to withhold the required amount from your salary or other amounts payable to you. 
6.

(a)
Voting. 
You will have no voting rights or other rights as a stockholder with respect to your RSUs prior to the time shares of Common Stock are delivered to you in settlement of the award.

(d)
Death. 
In the event of your death, any shares of Common Stock you are entitled to receive upon settlement of your RSUs will instead be delivered to your designated beneficiary or, if you have not designated a beneficiary, to the legal representative of your estate.
7.
Adjustments to Your Award in Certain Events
In the event of specified changes in the Company's capital structure, the Committee is required to make appropriate adjustment in the number and kind of shares authorized by the Plan and the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding awards. This Agreement will continue to apply to your RSUs as so adjusted. 
8.
Regulatory Compliance
The Company is not required to deliver Common Stock (including upon the vesting of RSUs) if such delivery would violate any applicable law or regulation or stock exchange requirement. If required by any federal or state securities law or regulation, the Company may impose restrictions on your ability to transfer shares received upon settlement of your RSUs. 
9.
Plan Terms
In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. All determinations and interpretations of the Plan and this Agreement made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. 
10.
Method of Acceptance
By accepting the RSUs, you shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, without the necessity of your signing this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that the acceptance of the RSUs constitutes satisfaction in full of any and all pre-existing understandings or commitments between the Company and you relating to your right to acquire equity securities of the Company.

RECITALS
The Committee (as defined below) responsible for administering the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), has determined that it is to the advantage and interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant, pursuant to the Plan, the option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the service of the Company or Related Company (as defined for purposes of the Plan) and to reward extraordinary effort during such service.

In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1.
 
Grant of Option
. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase on the terms and conditions set forth herein all or any part of an aggregate of the number of shares (the “Shares”) of the Common Stock of the Company (whether authorized and unissued or treasury shares) identified above next to the heading “No. of Shares” (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 below) at the purchase price per Share identified above next to the heading “Exercise Price” as the Optionee may, from time to time, elect. The Option shall vest and become exercisable as described in the immediately succeeding paragraph of this Section 1.  The Option shall expire on the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date” unless terminated sooner as otherwise provided herein.
 The Option shall vest and become exercisable as to all of the Shares covered by the Option, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which the average of the closing prices of the Company's Common Stock in the principal market on which the Common Stock trades for any 30 consecutive trading days during the Performance Period equals or exceeds $41.00
 
per Share or (ii) the date on which the Secondary Vesting Condition is satisfied; provided, however, that the Option shall not vest and become exercisable unless and until the Service Requirement has also been satisfied.  The “Secondary Vesting Condition” shall be satisfied if the Company's Total Shareholder Return is greater than both (i) the Total Shareholder Return of each of the Peer Companies and (ii) zero.  If the Option shall not have vested and become exercisable as provided above, the Option shall terminate.
As used in this Agreement:  (i) “Service Requirement” shall mean that the Optionee shall have a continuous Relationship from the Date of Grant through December 31, 2015 (or, if the Optionee's Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability (as those terms are defined in Section 6 below) on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, through the date of such termination of Relationship); (ii) “Performance Period” shall mean the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on December 31, 2018; (iii) “Total Shareholder Return” shall mean the increase, expressed as a percentage, in the closing price of the 
Company's Common Stock or the common stock of a Peer Company, as the case may be, from the Date of Grant to and including the last day of the Performance Period, assuming reinvestment of all dividends; and (iv) “Peer Companies” shall mean Boyd Gaming Corporation, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (provided, however, that if the Total Shareholder Return for a Peer Company is not available because the Peer Company is not in existence throughout the Performance Period or otherwise, such Peer Company shall be disregarded in determining whether the Secondary Vesting Condition has been satisfied).
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the Optionee's employment or other Relationship at any time, with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the Optionee's compensation from the rate in existence at the time the Option is granted. As used herein, the term “Relationship” shall mean that the Optionee is an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser or independent contractor of the Company or any Related Company.

Maximum Option Gain
. If, at the time all or any portion of the Option is exercised, the Fair Market Value Per Share (as defined in Section 4(f) below) of the Common Stock exceeds the per share Exercise Price identified above by more than $55, the number of Shares received upon such exercise of the Option shall be reduced by a number of Shares (the “Cutback Shares”) equal to the Cutback Value divided by the Fair Market Value Per Share of the Common Stock on the date of exercise (rounded up to the nearest whole Share).  As used in this Agreement, “Cutback Value” with respect to any exercise of the Option (or a portion thereof) shall mean the product of (i) the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of exercise exceeds the sum of the per share Exercise Price identified above plus $55.

To the extent that the Option has become exercisable hereunder, the Option may be exercised from time to time by written notice to the Company stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, together with payment in full of the purchase price therefor (determined prior to any reduction required by Section 3 above).  Payment of the purchase price for such Shares shall be made (i) in cash, (ii) by certified or cashier's check payable to the order of the Company, (iii) in other cash equivalents acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, (iv) in the Committee's sole discretion, by delivery of shares of the Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee or subject to vested stock options under the Plan, subject to such delivery being permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, including without limitation Section 78.288 thereof, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. If requested by the Committee, prior to the delivery of any Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a representation that the Shares are not being acquired with a view to distribution and will be sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. As soon after the notice of exercise as the Company is reasonably able to 
comply, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax to the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option, deliver to the Optionee or such other person, at the principal office of the Company or such other place as shall be mutually acceptable, a certificate or certificates for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above). 
(b)
If payment is made with shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee, the Optionee, or other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall deliver to the Company with the notice of exercise certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock in payment for the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company. In addition, if requested by the Committee, prior to the acceptance of such certificates in payment for the Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a written representation and warranty that he or she has good and marketable title to the shares represented by the certificate(s), free and clear of liens and encumbrances. The value of the shares of Common Stock so tendered in payment for the Shares being purchased shall be their Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of the Optionee's notice of exercise. 
(c)
If payment is to be made in shares of Common Stock subject to vested stock options under the Plan, the per share value attributable to the shares underlying the stock option(s) to be surrendered or canceled shall be the Fair Market Value Per Share of such shares less the exercise price per share of such option(s). The Company and the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall execute and deliver such instruments or modifications of stock options as shall be necessary to give effect to such an exercise of the Option. 
(d)
If for any reason a purported exercise of the Option providing for payment to be made in whole or in part through the delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned or underlying vested stock options is rejected by the Committee or is otherwise not permitted, such purported exercise shall not be effective unless, following notice thereof from the Company, the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option promptly pays the exercise price in an acceptable form. 
(e)
If the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option desires to exercise the Option with funds borrowed from a broker-dealer in a margin transaction under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and such method of exercise is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, the Optionee's notice of exercise may be delivered to the Company by such broker-dealer and the Company may deliver the certificate(s) for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above) to such broker-dealer on behalf of the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option. 
(f)
For purposes hereof, the “Fair Market Value Per Share” of the Company's Common Stock shall mean (i) if the Common Stock is publicly traded, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the Common Stock on the date in question or, if not available, on the trading date immediately following such date or (ii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”). 
(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of 
exercise of the Option or the delivery of the Shares for such period as may be required for the Company with reasonable diligence (i) to comply with any applicable listing, registration or qualification requirements of any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market or under any federal or state law or (ii) to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body. In addition, in connection with any exercise of the Option, the Committee may require the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option to agree not to dispose of any of the Shares acquired upon exercise thereof except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions which the Committee, in its sole discretion, then deems necessary or desirable in connection with any then existing and effective requirement or interpretation of any applicable federal or state securities law, rule or regulation. 
(h)
The Option may be exercised for less than the total number of Shares for which the Option is then exercisable, provided that a partial exercise may not be for less than 100 Shares, except in the final year of the term of the Option, and shall not, in any event, include any fractional Shares. 
5.
Tax Withholding
. The Optionee shall, no later than the date as of which any value attributed to the Option first becomes includible in the Optionee's gross income for applicable tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee (which in the sole discretion of the Committee may include delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee or subject to awards under the Plan subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b) or Section 4(c), as applicable) regarding payment of, any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect thereto, to enable the Company to claim a deduction in connection with the exercise of the Option or otherwise to satisfy any legal requirements. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 
6.
Termination of Option
. 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, if the Optionee ceases to have a Relationship for any reason, the Option shall terminate 90 days from the date on which such Relationship terminates unless the Optionee has resumed or initiated a Relationship and has a Relationship on such date.  During such 90-day period, the Optionee may exercise the Option  but only to the extent the Option was exercisable on the date of termination of the Optionee's Relationship and provided that the Option has not expired in accordance with Section 2 or otherwise terminated as provided herein. A leave of absence approved in writing by or on behalf of the Committee shall not be deemed a termination of Relationship for purposes of this Section 6, but the Option may not be exercised during any such leave of absence, except during the first 90 days thereof.  
In the event that the Relationship as an employee is terminated by the Optionee for Good Reason (as defined below) or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) or the Optionee's death or Permanent Disability, the above-described 90-day period shall be extended to six months following such termination.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in or for purposes of a written employment agreement in effect as of the date of termination between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the 
Optionee, or if “Good Reason” is not defined in or for purposes of any such employment agreement or no such employment agreement is in effect as of the date of termination, “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended (regardless of whether the Optionee is a participant in such plan).
In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, the Prorated Portion (as defined below) of the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Prorated Portion of the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Prorated Portion” means the total number of Shares covered by the Option multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 for which the Optionee has had a continuous Relationship, and the denominator of which is 48.  In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after December 31, 2015, the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Retirement” means the termination of the Optionee's service with the Company or a Related Company for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) after the Optionee has (i) obtained at least seventy-five (75) Points (as defined below), (ii) attained at least sixty (60) years of age and (iii) completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.  The Optionee's “Points” shall be equal to the sum of the Optionee's age (full years only) and full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Relationship is terminated for cause, the Option shall terminate upon the termination of the Relationship. 
(b)
In the case of death, the Option may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
(c)
As used herein, the term “Permanent Disability” shall mean termination of a Relationship with the Company or any Related Company with the consent of the Company or such Related Company by reason of permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As used herein, the term “for cause” shall mean that the Relationship is terminated by the Company or a Related Company due to (i) the commission by the Optionee of a substantial violation, through intentional conduct or through a pattern of behavior not corrected within a reasonable period of time after written notice to the Optionee by the Company or such Related Company of such behavior (in either case, whether by action or omission), of the Optionee's duties on behalf of the Company or a Related Company or the workplace policies or rules of the Company or a Related Company which conduct or behavior actually results in substantial harm to the 
Company or a Related Company or could reasonably be expected to put personnel of the Company or a Related Company in serious jeopardy of imminent harm to their safety, health or well-being or to cause substantial harm to the business of the Company or a Related Company or (ii) the commission by the Optionee of any act(s) or omission(s) constituting dishonesty, a felony or fraud or (iii) the failure of the Optionee to satisfy any requirements under applicable gaming laws or regulations for the continuance of the Optionee's Relationship with the Company or such Related Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event of any conflict between the definition of “for cause” set forth above and the definition of “for cause” or “cause” in any employment agreement the Optionee may have with the Company or a Related Company, the definition and other provisions concerning the determination of “for cause” or “cause” in such employment agreement shall control. For purposes of the Option, whether a Relationship is or has been terminated “for cause” shall be finally determined by the Committee. 
7.
Adjustments
. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, split-off, extraordinary cash dividend, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Company's Common Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, shall be made in the number and kind of shares or other property subject to the Option, the exercise price of the Option (along with the dollar value used to determine the maximum gain upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 3) and the vesting conditions set forth in Section 1 above; provided, however, that no such adjustment or substitution shall increase the aggregate value of the Option and no such adjustment or substitution shall result in the Company being required to sell or issue any fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment or substitution shall be made with respect to the Option pursuant to this Section 7 that would cause the Option, or any other option granted in substitution for the Option, to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
8.
Change in Control; Corporate Transaction
. In the event of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company. In the event of a Corporate Transaction (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company.  In addition, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation), or upon a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company, the Committee may take such action as it in its discretion deems appropriate to (i) cash out the Option at or immediately prior to the date of such event (based on the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time, after giving effect to Section 3 if applicable) and/or (ii) provide that the Option shall be exercisable for a period of at least 10 business days from the date of receipt of a notice from the Company of such proposed event, following the expiration of which period any unexercised portion of the Option shall 
terminate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no period of exercisability of the Option shall be provided pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence that would cause the Option to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
9.
Provisions Regarding Transferability
. The Optionee may transfer the Option to the Optionee's children, grandchildren or spouse (“Immediate Family”), to one or more trusts for the benefit of the Optionee's Immediate Family members, or to one or more partnerships or limited liability companies in which such Immediate Family members are the only partners or members only upon the express written consent of the Committee, and provided the Optionee does not receive any consideration in any form whatsoever for such transfer other than the receipt of an interest in the trust, partnership or limited liability company to which the Option is transferred. Upon any such transfer of the Option, the Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option immediately prior to the transfer thereof. Except as expressly provided in the first sentence of this Section 9, the Option is not assignable or transferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. 
10.
No Stockholder Rights
. The Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject hereto until the Optionee or such person has become the holder of record of such Shares, and no adjustment (except such adjustments as may be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 hereof) shall be made for dividends or distributions of rights in respect of such Shares if the record date is prior to the date on which the Optionee or such person becomes the holder of record. 
11.
Investment Representation
. The Optionee hereby represents that the Option and any Shares purchased hereunder are being acquired for the Optionee's own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof except as may be permitted by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
12.
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO ISSUE OR DELIVER SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION BY THE COMPANY OF ANY REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES UNDER ANY STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW OR RULINGS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY BODY OR THE MAKING OF SUCH INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS BY THE OPTIONEE (OR ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION) IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES WHICH THE COMMITTEE SHALL, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE. SUCH REQUIRED REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS THAT THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, (A) IS NOT PURCHASING SUCH SHARES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND (B) AGREES TO HAVE PLACED UPON THE FACE AND/OR REVERSE OF ANY CERTIFICATES FOR SUCH SHARES A LEGEND SETTING FORTH ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE OR A REFERENCE THERETO AND STATING THAT, PRIOR TO MAKING ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY SUCH SHARES, THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, WILL GIVE THE COMPANY NOTICE OF INTENTION TO SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE SHARES NOT LESS THAN FIVE 
DAYS PRIOR TO SUCH SALE OR DISPOSITION. 
13.
Optionee Subject to Section 16
. If the Optionee is a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and if for any reason the Option has not been approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, neither the Option (except upon its exercise) nor the Common Stock underlying the Option may be disposed of by the Optionee until six months have elapsed following the date of grant of the Option, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition. 
14.
Acceptance of Agreement
. By accepting the Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, without the necessity of the Optionee signing this Agreement. The Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the acceptance of the Option constitutes satisfaction in full of any and all pre-existing understandings or commitments between the Company and the Optionee relating to the Optionee's right to acquire equity securities of the Company. 
15.
Plan Terms
. The Option shall be subject to and governed by the terms and provisions of the Plan, which by this reference are incorporated herein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. All determinations and interpretations thereof made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto and upon their successors and assigns.

THIS AGREEMENT is made as of the Date of Grant set forth above, between AMERISTAR CASINOS, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the “Company”), and the optionee named above (hereinafter called the “Optionee”). 
RECITALS
The Committee (as defined below) responsible for administering the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), has determined that it is to the advantage and interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant, pursuant to the Plan, the option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the service of the Company or Related Company (as defined for purposes of the Plan) and to reward extraordinary effort during such service. 
As used herein, the term “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee or such other committee of directors appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company to administer the Plan, or, if no committee has been appointed for such purpose, reference to the “Committee” shall be deemed a reference to the Board of Directors of the Company. If the Optionee is not a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the term “Committee” shall extend to and include any officer of the Company to which the Committee has properly delegated any of its authorities to administer the Plan. 
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1.
 
Grant of Option
. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase on the terms and conditions set forth herein all or any part of an aggregate of the number of shares (the “Shares”) of the Common Stock of the Company (whether authorized and unissued or treasury shares) identified above next to the heading “No. of Shares” (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 below) at the purchase price per Share identified above next to the heading “Exercise Price” as the Optionee may, from time to time, elect. The Option shall vest and become exercisable as described in the immediately succeeding paragraph of this Section 1.  The Option shall expire on the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date” unless terminated sooner as otherwise provided herein.
 The Option shall vest and become exercisable as to all of the Shares covered by the Option, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which the average of the closing prices of the Company's Common Stock in the principal market on which the Common Stock trades for any 30 consecutive trading days during the Performance Period equals or exceeds $46.00
 
per Share or (ii) the date on which the Secondary Vesting Condition is satisfied; provided, however, that the Option shall not vest and become exercisable unless and until the Service Requirement has also been satisfied.  The “Secondary Vesting Condition” shall be satisfied if the Company's Total Shareholder Return is greater than both (i) the Total Shareholder Return of each of the Peer Companies and (ii) zero.  If the Option shall not have vested and become exercisable as provided above, the Option shall terminate.
As used in this Agreement:  (i) “Service Requirement” shall mean that the Optionee shall have a continuous Relationship from the Date of Grant through December 31, 2015 (or, if the Optionee's Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability (as those terms are defined in Section 6 below) on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, through the date of such termination of Relationship); (ii) “Performance Period” shall mean the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on December 31, 2018; (iii) “Total Shareholder Return” shall mean the increase, expressed as a percentage, in the closing price of the 
Company's Common Stock or the common stock of a Peer Company, as the case may be, from the Date of Grant to and including the last day of the Performance Period, assuming reinvestment of all dividends; and (iv) “Peer Companies” shall mean Boyd Gaming Corporation, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (provided, however, that if the Total Shareholder Return for a Peer Company is not available because the Peer Company is not in existence throughout the Performance Period or otherwise, such Peer Company shall be disregarded in determining whether the Secondary Vesting Condition has been satisfied).
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the Optionee's employment or other Relationship at any time, with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the Optionee's compensation from the rate in existence at the time the Option is granted. As used herein, the term “Relationship” shall mean that the Optionee is an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser or independent contractor of the Company or any Related Company. 
2.
Term of Option
. The right to exercise the Option granted hereunder, to the extent unexercised, shall remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. 
3.
Maximum Option Gain
. If, at the time all or any portion of the Option is exercised, the Fair Market Value Per Share (as defined in Section 4(f) below) of the Common Stock exceeds the per share Exercise Price identified above by more than $55, the number of Shares received upon such exercise of the Option shall be reduced by a number of Shares (the “Cutback Shares”) equal to the Cutback Value divided by the Fair Market Value Per Share of the Common Stock on the date of exercise (rounded up to the nearest whole Share).  As used in this Agreement, “Cutback Value” with respect to any exercise of the Option (or a portion thereof) shall mean the product of (i) the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of exercise exceeds the sum of the per share Exercise Price identified above plus $55.  Upon exercise of the Option (or a portion thereof), the Cutback Shares, if any, determined pursuant to this Section 3 shall be deemed forfeited without payment of any additional consideration by the Company therefor.
4.
Method of Exercise
. 
(a)
To the extent that the Option has become exercisable hereunder, the Option may be exercised from time to time by written notice to the Company stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, together with payment in full of the purchase price therefor (determined prior to any reduction required by Section 3 above).  Payment of the purchase price for such Shares shall be made (i) in cash, (ii) by certified or cashier's check payable to the order of the Company, (iii) in other cash equivalents acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, (iv) in the Committee's sole discretion, by delivery of shares of the Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee or subject to vested stock options under the Plan, subject to such delivery being permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, including without limitation Section 78.288 thereof, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. If requested by the Committee, prior to the delivery of any Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a representation that the Shares are not being acquired with a view to distribution and will be sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. As soon after the notice of exercise as the Company is reasonably able to 
comply, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax to the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option, deliver to the Optionee or such other person, at the principal office of the Company or such other place as shall be mutually acceptable, a certificate or certificates for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above). 
(b)
If payment is made with shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee, the Optionee, or other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall deliver to the Company with the notice of exercise certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock in payment for the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company. In addition, if requested by the Committee, prior to the acceptance of such certificates in payment for the Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a written representation and warranty that he or she has good and marketable title to the shares represented by the certificate(s), free and clear of liens and encumbrances. The value of the shares of Common Stock so tendered in payment for the Shares being purchased shall be their Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of the Optionee's notice of exercise. 
(c)
If payment is to be made in shares of Common Stock subject to vested stock options under the Plan, the per share value attributable to the shares underlying the stock option(s) to be surrendered or canceled shall be the Fair Market Value Per Share of such shares less the exercise price per share of such option(s). The Company and the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall execute and deliver such instruments or modifications of stock options as shall be necessary to give effect to such an exercise of the Option. 
(d)
If for any reason a purported exercise of the Option providing for payment to be made in whole or in part through the delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned or underlying vested stock options is rejected by the Committee or is otherwise not permitted, such purported exercise shall not be effective unless, following notice thereof from the Company, the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option promptly pays the exercise price in an acceptable form. 
(e)
If the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option desires to exercise the Option with funds borrowed from a broker-dealer in a margin transaction under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and such method of exercise is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, the Optionee's notice of exercise may be delivered to the Company by such broker-dealer and the Company may deliver the certificate(s) for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above) to such broker-dealer on behalf of the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option. 
(f)
For purposes hereof, the “Fair Market Value Per Share” of the Company's Common Stock shall mean (i) if the Common Stock is publicly traded, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the Common Stock on the date in question or, if not available, on the trading date immediately following such date or (ii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”). 
(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of 
exercise of the Option or the delivery of the Shares for such period as may be required for the Company with reasonable diligence (i) to comply with any applicable listing, registration or qualification requirements of any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market or under any federal or state law or (ii) to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body. In addition, in connection with any exercise of the Option, the Committee may require the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option to agree not to dispose of any of the Shares acquired upon exercise thereof except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions which the Committee, in its sole discretion, then deems necessary or desirable in connection with any then existing and effective requirement or interpretation of any applicable federal or state securities law, rule or regulation. 
(h)
The Option may be exercised for less than the total number of Shares for which the Option is then exercisable, provided that a partial exercise may not be for less than 100 Shares, except in the final year of the term of the Option, and shall not, in any event, include any fractional Shares. 
5.
Tax Withholding
. The Optionee shall, no later than the date as of which any value attributed to the Option first becomes includible in the Optionee's gross income for applicable tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee (which in the sole discretion of the Committee may include delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee or subject to awards under the Plan subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b) or Section 4(c), as applicable) regarding payment of, any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect thereto, to enable the Company to claim a deduction in connection with the exercise of the Option or otherwise to satisfy any legal requirements. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 
6.
Termination of Option
. 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, if the Optionee ceases to have a Relationship for any reason, the Option shall terminate 90 days from the date on which such Relationship terminates unless the Optionee has resumed or initiated a Relationship and has a Relationship on such date.  During such 90-day period, the Optionee may exercise the Option  but only to the extent the Option was exercisable on the date of termination of the Optionee's Relationship and provided that the Option has not expired in accordance with Section 2 or otherwise terminated as provided herein. A leave of absence approved in writing by or on behalf of the Committee shall not be deemed a termination of Relationship for purposes of this Section 6, but the Option may not be exercised during any such leave of absence, except during the first 90 days thereof.  
In the event that the Relationship as an employee is terminated by the Optionee for Good Reason (as defined below) or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) or the Optionee's death or Permanent Disability, the above-described 90-day period shall be extended to six months following such termination.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in or for purposes of a written employment agreement in effect as of the date of termination between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the 
Optionee, or if “Good Reason” is not defined in or for purposes of any such employment agreement or no such employment agreement is in effect as of the date of termination, “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended (regardless of whether the Optionee is a participant in such plan).
In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, the Prorated Portion (as defined below) of the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Prorated Portion of the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Prorated Portion” means the total number of Shares covered by the Option multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 for which the Optionee has had a continuous Relationship, and the denominator of which is 48.  In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after December 31, 2015, the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Retirement” means the termination of the Optionee's service with the Company or a Related Company for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) after the Optionee has (i) obtained at least seventy-five (75) Points (as defined below), (ii) attained at least sixty (60) years of age and (iii) completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.  The Optionee's “Points” shall be equal to the sum of the Optionee's age (full years only) and full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Relationship is terminated for cause, the Option shall terminate upon the termination of the Relationship. 
(b)
In the case of death, the Option may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
(c)
As used herein, the term “Permanent Disability” shall mean termination of a Relationship with the Company or any Related Company with the consent of the Company or such Related Company by reason of permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As used herein, the term “for cause” shall mean that the Relationship is terminated by the Company or a Related Company due to (i) the commission by the Optionee of a substantial violation, through intentional conduct or through a pattern of behavior not corrected within a reasonable period of time after written notice to the Optionee by the Company or such Related Company of such behavior (in either case, whether by action or omission), of the Optionee's duties on behalf of the Company or a Related Company or the workplace policies or rules of the Company or a Related Company which conduct or behavior actually results in substantial harm to the 
Company or a Related Company or could reasonably be expected to put personnel of the Company or a Related Company in serious jeopardy of imminent harm to their safety, health or well-being or to cause substantial harm to the business of the Company or a Related Company or (ii) the commission by the Optionee of any act(s) or omission(s) constituting dishonesty, a felony or fraud or (iii) the failure of the Optionee to satisfy any requirements under applicable gaming laws or regulations for the continuance of the Optionee's Relationship with the Company or such Related Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event of any conflict between the definition of “for cause” set forth above and the definition of “for cause” or “cause” in any employment agreement the Optionee may have with the Company or a Related Company, the definition and other provisions concerning the determination of “for cause” or “cause” in such employment agreement shall control. For purposes of the Option, whether a Relationship is or has been terminated “for cause” shall be finally determined by the Committee. 
7.
Adjustments
. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, split-off, extraordinary cash dividend, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Company's Common Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, shall be made in the number and kind of shares or other property subject to the Option, the exercise price of the Option (along with the dollar value used to determine the maximum gain upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 3) and the vesting conditions set forth in Section 1 above; provided, however, that no such adjustment or substitution shall increase the aggregate value of the Option and no such adjustment or substitution shall result in the Company being required to sell or issue any fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment or substitution shall be made with respect to the Option pursuant to this Section 7 that would cause the Option, or any other option granted in substitution for the Option, to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
8.
Change in Control; Corporate Transaction
. In the event of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company. In the event of a Corporate Transaction (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company.  In addition, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation), or upon a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company, the Committee may take such action as it in its discretion deems appropriate to (i) cash out the Option at or immediately prior to the date of such event (based on the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time, after giving effect to Section 3 if applicable) and/or (ii) provide that the Option shall be exercisable for a period of at least 10 business days from the date of receipt of a notice from the Company of such proposed event, following the expiration of which period any unexercised portion of the Option shall 
terminate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no period of exercisability of the Option shall be provided pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence that would cause the Option to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
9.
Provisions Regarding Transferability
. The Optionee may transfer the Option to the Optionee's children, grandchildren or spouse (“Immediate Family”), to one or more trusts for the benefit of the Optionee's Immediate Family members, or to one or more partnerships or limited liability companies in which such Immediate Family members are the only partners or members only upon the express written consent of the Committee, and provided the Optionee does not receive any consideration in any form whatsoever for such transfer other than the receipt of an interest in the trust, partnership or limited liability company to which the Option is transferred. Upon any such transfer of the Option, the Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option immediately prior to the transfer thereof. Except as expressly provided in the first sentence of this Section 9, the Option is not assignable or transferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. 
10.
No Stockholder Rights
. The Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject hereto until the Optionee or such person has become the holder of record of such Shares, and no adjustment (except such adjustments as may be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 hereof) shall be made for dividends or distributions of rights in respect of such Shares if the record date is prior to the date on which the Optionee or such person becomes the holder of record. 
11.
Investment Representation
. The Optionee hereby represents that the Option and any Shares purchased hereunder are being acquired for the Optionee's own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof except as may be permitted by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
12.
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO ISSUE OR DELIVER SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION BY THE COMPANY OF ANY REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES UNDER ANY STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW OR RULINGS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY BODY OR THE MAKING OF SUCH INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS BY THE OPTIONEE (OR ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION) IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES WHICH THE COMMITTEE SHALL, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE. SUCH REQUIRED REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS THAT THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, (A) IS NOT PURCHASING SUCH SHARES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND (B) AGREES TO HAVE PLACED UPON THE FACE AND/OR REVERSE OF ANY CERTIFICATES FOR SUCH SHARES A LEGEND SETTING FORTH ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE OR A REFERENCE THERETO AND STATING THAT, PRIOR TO MAKING ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY SUCH SHARES, THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, WILL GIVE THE COMPANY NOTICE OF INTENTION TO SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE SHARES NOT LESS THAN FIVE 
DAYS PRIOR TO SUCH SALE OR DISPOSITION. 
13.
Optionee Subject to Section 16
. If the Optionee is a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and if for any reason the Option has not been approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, neither the Option (except upon its exercise) nor the Common Stock underlying the Option may be disposed of by the Optionee until six months have elapsed following the date of grant of the Option, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition. 
14.
Acceptance of Agreement
. By accepting the Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, without the necessity of the Optionee signing this Agreement. The Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the acceptance of the Option constitutes satisfaction in full of any and all pre-existing understandings or commitments between the Company and the Optionee relating to the Optionee's right to acquire equity securities of the Company. 
15.
Plan Terms
. The Option shall be subject to and governed by the terms and provisions of the Plan, which by this reference are incorporated herein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. All determinations and interpretations thereof made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto and upon their successors and assigns.

THIS AGREEMENT is made as of the Date of Grant set forth above, between AMERISTAR CASINOS, INC., a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the “Company”), and the optionee named above (hereinafter called the “Optionee”). 
RECITALS
The Committee (as defined below) responsible for administering the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), has determined that it is to the advantage and interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant, pursuant to the Plan, the option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to remain in the service of the Company or Related Company (as defined for purposes of the Plan) and to reward extraordinary effort during such service. 
As used herein, the term “Committee” shall mean the Compensation Committee or such other committee of directors appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company to administer the Plan, or, if no committee has been appointed for such purpose, reference to the “Committee” shall be deemed a reference to the Board of Directors of the Company. If the Optionee is not a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the term “Committee” shall extend to and include any officer of the Company to which the Committee has properly delegated any of its authorities to administer the Plan. 
In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1.
 
Grant of Option
. The Company hereby grants to the Optionee the right and option (the “Option”) to purchase on the terms and conditions set forth herein all or any part of an aggregate of the number of shares (the “Shares”) of the Common Stock of the Company (whether authorized and unissued or treasury shares) identified above next to the heading “No. of Shares” (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 below) at the purchase price per Share identified above next to the heading “Exercise Price” as the Optionee may, from time to time, elect. The Option shall vest and become exercisable as described in the immediately succeeding paragraph of this Section 1.  The Option shall expire on the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date” unless terminated sooner as otherwise provided herein.
 The Option shall vest and become exercisable as to all of the Shares covered by the Option, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which the average of the closing prices of the Company's Common Stock in the principal market on which the Common Stock trades for any 30 consecutive trading days during the Performance Period equals or exceeds $51.00
 
per Share or (ii) the date on which the Secondary Vesting Condition is satisfied; provided, however, that the Option shall not vest and become exercisable unless and until the Service Requirement has also been satisfied.  The “Secondary Vesting Condition” shall be satisfied if the Company's Total Shareholder Return is greater than both (i) the Total Shareholder Return of each of the Peer Companies and (ii) zero.  If the Option shall not have vested and become exercisable as provided above, the Option shall terminate.
As used in this Agreement:  (i) “Service Requirement” shall mean that the Optionee shall have a continuous Relationship from the Date of Grant through December 31, 2015 (or, if the Optionee's Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability (as those terms are defined in Section 6 below) on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, through the date of such termination of Relationship); (ii) “Performance Period” shall mean the period beginning on the Date of Grant and ending on December 31, 2018; (iii) “Total Shareholder Return” shall mean the increase, expressed as a percentage, in the closing price of the 
Company's Common Stock or the common stock of a Peer Company, as the case may be, from the Date of Grant to and including the last day of the Performance Period, assuming reinvestment of all dividends; and (iv) “Peer Companies” shall mean Boyd Gaming Corporation, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., Penn National Gaming, Inc. and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (provided, however, that if the Total Shareholder Return for a Peer Company is not available because the Peer Company is not in existence throughout the Performance Period or otherwise, such Peer Company shall be disregarded in determining whether the Secondary Vesting Condition has been satisfied).
Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate the Optionee's employment or other Relationship at any time, with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the Optionee's compensation from the rate in existence at the time the Option is granted. As used herein, the term “Relationship” shall mean that the Optionee is an officer, director, employee, consultant, adviser or independent contractor of the Company or any Related Company. 
2.
Term of Option
. The right to exercise the Option granted hereunder, to the extent unexercised, shall remain in effect until the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant, unless sooner terminated as provided herein. 
3.
Maximum Option Gain
. If, at the time all or any portion of the Option is exercised, the Fair Market Value Per Share (as defined in Section 4(f) below) of the Common Stock exceeds the per share Exercise Price identified above by more than $55, the number of Shares received upon such exercise of the Option shall be reduced by a number of Shares (the “Cutback Shares”) equal to the Cutback Value divided by the Fair Market Value Per Share of the Common Stock on the date of exercise (rounded up to the nearest whole Share).  As used in this Agreement, “Cutback Value” with respect to any exercise of the Option (or a portion thereof) shall mean the product of (i) the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised multiplied by (ii) the amount by which the Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of exercise exceeds the sum of the per share Exercise Price identified above plus $55.  Upon exercise of the Option (or a portion thereof), the Cutback Shares, if any, determined pursuant to this Section 3 shall be deemed forfeited without payment of any additional consideration by the Company therefor.
4.
Method of Exercise
. 
(a)
To the extent that the Option has become exercisable hereunder, the Option may be exercised from time to time by written notice to the Company stating the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, together with payment in full of the purchase price therefor (determined prior to any reduction required by Section 3 above).  Payment of the purchase price for such Shares shall be made (i) in cash, (ii) by certified or cashier's check payable to the order of the Company, (iii) in other cash equivalents acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, (iv) in the Committee's sole discretion, by delivery of shares of the Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee or subject to vested stock options under the Plan, subject to such delivery being permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, including without limitation Section 78.288 thereof, or (v) any combination of the foregoing. If requested by the Committee, prior to the delivery of any Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a representation that the Shares are not being acquired with a view to distribution and will be sold or otherwise disposed of only in accordance with applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. As soon after the notice of exercise as the Company is reasonably able to 
comply, the Company shall, without transfer or issue tax to the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option, deliver to the Optionee or such other person, at the principal office of the Company or such other place as shall be mutually acceptable, a certificate or certificates for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above). 
(b)
If payment is made with shares of Common Stock of the Company already owned by the Optionee, the Optionee, or other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall deliver to the Company with the notice of exercise certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock in payment for the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company. In addition, if requested by the Committee, prior to the acceptance of such certificates in payment for the Shares, the Optionee, or any other person entitled to exercise the Option, shall supply the Committee with a written representation and warranty that he or she has good and marketable title to the shares represented by the certificate(s), free and clear of liens and encumbrances. The value of the shares of Common Stock so tendered in payment for the Shares being purchased shall be their Fair Market Value Per Share on the date of the Optionee's notice of exercise. 
(c)
If payment is to be made in shares of Common Stock subject to vested stock options under the Plan, the per share value attributable to the shares underlying the stock option(s) to be surrendered or canceled shall be the Fair Market Value Per Share of such shares less the exercise price per share of such option(s). The Company and the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall execute and deliver such instruments or modifications of stock options as shall be necessary to give effect to such an exercise of the Option. 
(d)
If for any reason a purported exercise of the Option providing for payment to be made in whole or in part through the delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned or underlying vested stock options is rejected by the Committee or is otherwise not permitted, such purported exercise shall not be effective unless, following notice thereof from the Company, the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option promptly pays the exercise price in an acceptable form. 
(e)
If the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option desires to exercise the Option with funds borrowed from a broker-dealer in a margin transaction under Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and such method of exercise is acceptable to the Committee in its sole discretion, the Optionee's notice of exercise may be delivered to the Company by such broker-dealer and the Company may deliver the certificate(s) for the Shares being purchased (as reduced, if required, pursuant to Section 3 above) to such broker-dealer on behalf of the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option. 
(f)
For purposes hereof, the “Fair Market Value Per Share” of the Company's Common Stock shall mean (i) if the Common Stock is publicly traded, the mean between the highest and lowest quoted selling prices of the Common Stock on the date in question or, if not available, on the trading date immediately following such date or (ii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value as determined by the Committee in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (“Section 409A”). 
(g)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to postpone the time of 
exercise of the Option or the delivery of the Shares for such period as may be required for the Company with reasonable diligence (i) to comply with any applicable listing, registration or qualification requirements of any national securities exchange or over-the-counter market or under any federal or state law or (ii) to obtain the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body. In addition, in connection with any exercise of the Option, the Committee may require the Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option to agree not to dispose of any of the Shares acquired upon exercise thereof except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions which the Committee, in its sole discretion, then deems necessary or desirable in connection with any then existing and effective requirement or interpretation of any applicable federal or state securities law, rule or regulation. 
(h)
The Option may be exercised for less than the total number of Shares for which the Option is then exercisable, provided that a partial exercise may not be for less than 100 Shares, except in the final year of the term of the Option, and shall not, in any event, include any fractional Shares. 
5.
Tax Withholding
. The Optionee shall, no later than the date as of which any value attributed to the Option first becomes includible in the Optionee's gross income for applicable tax purposes, pay to the Company, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee (which in the sole discretion of the Committee may include delivery of shares of Common Stock already owned by the Optionee or subject to awards under the Plan subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 4(b) or Section 4(c), as applicable) regarding payment of, any federal, state, local or other taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect thereto, to enable the Company to claim a deduction in connection with the exercise of the Option or otherwise to satisfy any legal requirements. The obligations of the Company hereunder shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company (and, where applicable, any Related Company), shall, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to the Optionee. 
6.
Termination of Option
. 
(a)
Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, if the Optionee ceases to have a Relationship for any reason, the Option shall terminate 90 days from the date on which such Relationship terminates unless the Optionee has resumed or initiated a Relationship and has a Relationship on such date.  During such 90-day period, the Optionee may exercise the Option  but only to the extent the Option was exercisable on the date of termination of the Optionee's Relationship and provided that the Option has not expired in accordance with Section 2 or otherwise terminated as provided herein. A leave of absence approved in writing by or on behalf of the Committee shall not be deemed a termination of Relationship for purposes of this Section 6, but the Option may not be exercised during any such leave of absence, except during the first 90 days thereof.  
In the event that the Relationship as an employee is terminated by the Optionee for Good Reason (as defined below) or by the Company or one of its subsidiaries for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) or the Optionee's death or Permanent Disability, the above-described 90-day period shall be extended to six months following such termination.  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in or for purposes of a written employment agreement in effect as of the date of termination between the Company or one of its subsidiaries and the 
Optionee, or if “Good Reason” is not defined in or for purposes of any such employment agreement or no such employment agreement is in effect as of the date of termination, “Good Reason” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Ameristar Casinos, Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan, as amended (regardless of whether the Optionee is a participant in such plan).
In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after January 1, 2015 and before December 31, 2015, the Prorated Portion (as defined below) of the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Prorated Portion of the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Prorated Portion” means the total number of Shares covered by the Option multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full calendar months between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2015 for which the Optionee has had a continuous Relationship, and the denominator of which is 48.  In the event that the Relationship is terminated by reason of the Optionee's Retirement, death or Permanent Disability on or after December 31, 2015, the Option shall continue to be eligible to vest as described in Section 1 hereof, and the Option shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) four years from the date of termination of the Relationship or the date on which the Option vests, whichever occurs later, or (ii) the date set forth above next to the heading “Expiration Date.”  For purposes of this Section 6(a), “Retirement” means the termination of the Optionee's service with the Company or a Related Company for any reason other than cause (as defined in Section 6(c)) after the Optionee has (i) obtained at least seventy-five (75) Points (as defined below), (ii) attained at least sixty (60) years of age and (iii) completed at least five (5) full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company.  The Optionee's “Points” shall be equal to the sum of the Optionee's age (full years only) and full years of service with the Company or a Related Company, including service as a non-employee member of the Board of Directors of the Company or a Related Company. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Relationship is terminated for cause, the Option shall terminate upon the termination of the Relationship. 
(b)
In the case of death, the Option may be exercised by the person or persons to whom the Optionee's rights under the Option shall pass by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
(c)
As used herein, the term “Permanent Disability” shall mean termination of a Relationship with the Company or any Related Company with the consent of the Company or such Related Company by reason of permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As used herein, the term “for cause” shall mean that the Relationship is terminated by the Company or a Related Company due to (i) the commission by the Optionee of a substantial violation, through intentional conduct or through a pattern of behavior not corrected within a reasonable period of time after written notice to the Optionee by the Company or such Related Company of such behavior (in either case, whether by action or omission), of the Optionee's duties on behalf of the Company or a Related Company or the workplace policies or rules of the Company or a Related Company which conduct or behavior actually results in substantial harm to the 
Company or a Related Company or could reasonably be expected to put personnel of the Company or a Related Company in serious jeopardy of imminent harm to their safety, health or well-being or to cause substantial harm to the business of the Company or a Related Company or (ii) the commission by the Optionee of any act(s) or omission(s) constituting dishonesty, a felony or fraud or (iii) the failure of the Optionee to satisfy any requirements under applicable gaming laws or regulations for the continuance of the Optionee's Relationship with the Company or such Related Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event of any conflict between the definition of “for cause” set forth above and the definition of “for cause” or “cause” in any employment agreement the Optionee may have with the Company or a Related Company, the definition and other provisions concerning the determination of “for cause” or “cause” in such employment agreement shall control. For purposes of the Option, whether a Relationship is or has been terminated “for cause” shall be finally determined by the Committee. 
7.
Adjustments
. In the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all assets, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, split-up, split-off, extraordinary cash dividend, distribution of assets or other change in corporate structure affecting the Company's Common Stock, a substitution or adjustment, as may be determined to be appropriate by the Committee in its sole discretion, shall be made in the number and kind of shares or other property subject to the Option, the exercise price of the Option (along with the dollar value used to determine the maximum gain upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 3) and the vesting conditions set forth in Section 1 above; provided, however, that no such adjustment or substitution shall increase the aggregate value of the Option and no such adjustment or substitution shall result in the Company being required to sell or issue any fractional Shares.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment or substitution shall be made with respect to the Option pursuant to this Section 7 that would cause the Option, or any other option granted in substitution for the Option, to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
8.
Change in Control; Corporate Transaction
. In the event of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately upon the effective time of the Change in Control, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company. In the event of a Corporate Transaction (as that term is defined in the Plan), any portion of the Option which is not otherwise fully vested and exercisable with respect to all of the Shares at that time subject to the Option shall automatically accelerate so that the Option shall, immediately prior to the effective time of the Corporate Transaction, become exercisable for all the Shares at the time subject to the Option and may be exercised for any or all of those Shares as fully vested shares of Common Stock of the Company.  In addition, upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or upon any reorganization, merger or consolidation as a result of which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation), or upon a sale of substantially all the assets of the Company, the Committee may take such action as it in its discretion deems appropriate to (i) cash out the Option at or immediately prior to the date of such event (based on the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time, after giving effect to Section 3 if applicable) and/or (ii) provide that the Option shall be exercisable for a period of at least 10 business days from the date of receipt of a notice from the Company of such proposed event, following the expiration of which period any unexercised portion of the Option shall 
terminate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no period of exercisability of the Option shall be provided pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence that would cause the Option to be treated as providing for a deferral of compensation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(5)(i).
9.
Provisions Regarding Transferability
. The Optionee may transfer the Option to the Optionee's children, grandchildren or spouse (“Immediate Family”), to one or more trusts for the benefit of the Optionee's Immediate Family members, or to one or more partnerships or limited liability companies in which such Immediate Family members are the only partners or members only upon the express written consent of the Committee, and provided the Optionee does not receive any consideration in any form whatsoever for such transfer other than the receipt of an interest in the trust, partnership or limited liability company to which the Option is transferred. Upon any such transfer of the Option, the Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions as were applicable to the Option immediately prior to the transfer thereof. Except as expressly provided in the first sentence of this Section 9, the Option is not assignable or transferable by the Optionee, either voluntarily or by operation of law, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. 
10.
No Stockholder Rights
. The Optionee or other person entitled to exercise the Option shall have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to any Shares subject hereto until the Optionee or such person has become the holder of record of such Shares, and no adjustment (except such adjustments as may be effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 7 hereof) shall be made for dividends or distributions of rights in respect of such Shares if the record date is prior to the date on which the Optionee or such person becomes the holder of record. 
11.
Investment Representation
. The Optionee hereby represents that the Option and any Shares purchased hereunder are being acquired for the Optionee's own account and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof except as may be permitted by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
12.
Conditions to Issuance of Shares
. THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO ISSUE OR DELIVER SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION BY THE COMPANY OF ANY REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES UNDER ANY STATE AND/OR FEDERAL LAW OR RULINGS OR REGULATIONS OF ANY GOVERNMENT REGULATORY BODY OR THE MAKING OF SUCH INVESTMENT REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS BY THE OPTIONEE (OR ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION) IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ANY EXEMPTION FROM ANY SUCH REGISTRATION OR OTHER QUALIFICATION OF SUCH SHARES WHICH THE COMMITTEE SHALL, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, DEEM NECESSARY OR ADVISABLE. SUCH REQUIRED REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS THAT THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, (A) IS NOT PURCHASING SUCH SHARES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND (B) AGREES TO HAVE PLACED UPON THE FACE AND/OR REVERSE OF ANY CERTIFICATES FOR SUCH SHARES A LEGEND SETTING FORTH ANY REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO THE COMMITTEE OR A REFERENCE THERETO AND STATING THAT, PRIOR TO MAKING ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF ANY SUCH SHARES, THE OPTIONEE, OR ANY OTHER PERSON ENTITLED TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, WILL GIVE THE COMPANY NOTICE OF INTENTION TO SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE SHARES NOT LESS THAN FIVE 
DAYS PRIOR TO SUCH SALE OR DISPOSITION. 
13.
Optionee Subject to Section 16
. If the Optionee is a person subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and if for any reason the Option has not been approved in the manner provided for in clause (d)(1) or (d)(2) of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, neither the Option (except upon its exercise) nor the Common Stock underlying the Option may be disposed of by the Optionee until six months have elapsed following the date of grant of the Option, unless the Committee otherwise specifically permits such disposition. 
14.
Acceptance of Agreement
. By accepting the Option, the Optionee shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Plan, without the necessity of the Optionee signing this Agreement. The Optionee hereby acknowledges and agrees that the acceptance of the Option constitutes satisfaction in full of any and all pre-existing understandings or commitments between the Company and the Optionee relating to the Optionee's right to acquire equity securities of the Company. 
15.
Plan Terms
. The Option shall be subject to and governed by the terms and provisions of the Plan, which by this reference are incorporated herein. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall govern. All determinations and interpretations thereof made by the Committee shall be conclusive and binding on all parties hereto and upon their successors and assigns. 
EXECUTED as of the Date of Grant.

Pursuant to a Modified Local Development Agreement (the &#8220;Modified LDA&#8221;), for the period beginning June 3, 2011, Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC (&#8220;ACEC&#8221;) is required to pay 1.625% of its adjusted gross receipts from operation of the casino (&#8220;AGR&#8221;) to the City of East Chicago, Indiana (the &#8220;City&#8221;) and 1.625% of its AGR to Foundations of East Chicago, Inc., an Indiana not-for-profit corporation (&#8220;FEC&#8221;), to be used by the recipients solely to support and assist economic development in the City through specified initiatives set forth in the Modified LDA and for reasonable and necessary administrative expenses. The Modified LDA provides that ACEC will make the payments to separate and segregated bank accounts maintained by each recipient within 20 days after the last day of each calendar month; provided, however, that if directed by the Indiana Gaming Commission (the &#8220;IGC&#8221;), ACEC must make the payments to one or more held bank accounts. ACEC&#8217;s sole obligation under the Modified LDA is to make the economic development payments described above, and it has no obligation to monitor or enforce the proper use of the payments by the recipients, which is the duty of the IGC. The Modified LDA will continue in effect until the termination or expiration of the East Chicago riverboat gaming license or until any final and non-appealable order or other action is taken by the IGC to disapprove or terminate the Modified LDA. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Modified LDA modified and superseded in its entirety the prior local development agreement for the East Chicago casino (the &#8220;Prior LDA&#8221;), pursuant to which ACEC had been paying 2% of its AGR to FEC, 1% of its AGR to the City and 0.75% of its AGR to East Chicago Second Century, Inc., an Indiana corporation (&#8220;Second Century&#8221;), with the respective amounts payable to FEC and Second Century being deposited into two ACEC segregated bank accounts. On June 30, 2011, ACEC, the City, FEC and Second Century agreed in principle to accept the terms of the Modified LDA, allocate and distribute the funds in the two ACEC segregated bank accounts and dismiss with prejudice all pending claims against each other with respect to the Prior LDA and the Modified LDA. On September 29, 2011, the two lawsuits in which the Company was a defendant were dismissed with prejudice (except for certain claims not involving the Company). As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company&#8217;s East Chicago LDA liability was </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.7 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$28.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Self-Insurance Reserves.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;The Company is self-insured for various levels of general liability, workers&#8217; compensation and employee health coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims. At December&#160;31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$9.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$10.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively. The Company considers historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities. The Company believes the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals; however, changes in health care costs, accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Guarantees.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;In December 2000, the Company assumed several agreements with the Missouri 210 Highway Transportation Development District (&#8220;Development District&#8221;) that had been entered into in order to assist the Development District in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the Ameristar Kansas City property prior to the Company&#8217;s purchase of that property. In order to pay for the highway improvement project, the Development District issued revenue bonds totaling </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$9.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> with scheduled maturities from 2006 through 2011.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company has provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank in support of obligations of the Development District for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds. The amount outstanding under this letter of credit was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$2.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> as of December&#160;31, 2011 and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds, as well as any costs incurred by the Development District that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders. Through December&#160;31, 2011, the Company had paid </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$2.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in shortfalls and other costs. As required by the agreements, the Company anticipates that it will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the Development District from future available cash flow, as defined, and has recorded a corresponding receivable as of December&#160;31, 2011.</font></div></div>

Through the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company matched, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to the first </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">5%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of participants&#8217; annual salary deferrals and the first </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">5%</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of participants&#8217; annual bonus deferrals in each participant's account.

The Company&#8217;s obligation under the plan represents an unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, assets of the plan would be available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. To increase the security of the participants&#8217; deferred compensation plan benefits, the Company has established and funded a grantor trust (known as a &#8220;rabbi trust&#8221;). The rabbi trust is specifically designed so that assets are available to pay plan benefits to participants in the event the Company is unwilling or unable to pay the plan benefits for any reason other than bankruptcy or insolvency. As a result, the Company is prevented from withdrawing or accessing assets for corporate needs. Plan participants choose to receive a return on their account balances equal to the return on various investment options. The Company currently invests plan assets in an equity-based life insurance product of which the rabbi trust is the owner and beneficiary.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Effective December 31, 2011, ACI&#8217;s Board of Directors terminated the deferred compensation plan. A partial distribution of plan assets was made to participants in May 2011. The Company anticipates making a final distribution of plan assets to participants in the second quarter of 2012. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, plan assets were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$15.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$18.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, and are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the 2011 presentation and deposits and other assets in the 2010 presentation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In 2011, the liability balance is reflected in accrued liabilities and in 2010, it is reflected in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The guidance provides users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (i)&#160;how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii)&#160;how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under the previous guidance and its related interpretations and (iii)&#160;how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In 2008, the Company entered into two forward interest rate swaps with two different commercial banks to fix the interest rate on certain LIBOR-based borrowings under its credit facility. Both swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Pursuant to each of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company was obligated to make quarterly fixed rate payments to the counterparty, while the counterparty was obligated to make quarterly variable rate payments to the Company based on three-month LIBOR on the same notional amount.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company&#8217;s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives in place.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">As of December&#160;31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the interest rate swap liability was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">zero</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> due to the expiration of both interest rate swap agreements on July&#160;19, 2010. For the year ended December&#160;31, 2010, the swaps increased the Company&#8217;s interest expense by </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$16.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">There was no net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December&#160;31, 2010 was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$10.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements in the future, although it has no current intention to do so.</font></div></div>

For a derivative such as an interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.&#160;To the extent the effective portion of a hedge subsequently becomes ineffective, the corresponding amount of the change in fair value of the derivative initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified and is recognized directly in earnings.&#160;Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of a hypothetical designated perfect hedged item or transaction.&#160;If the change in the actual swap is greater than the change in the hypothetical perfect swap, the difference is referred to as &#8220;ineffectiveness&#8221; and is recognized in earnings in the current period.</font></div></div>

The Compensation Committee of ACI&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Compensation Committee&#8221;) administers the Company&#8217;s stock incentive plans and has broad discretion to establish the terms of stock awards, including, without limitation, the power to set the term (up to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">10</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;years), vesting schedule and exercise price of stock options.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">For the years ended December&#160;31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total stock-based compensation expense was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$24.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$14.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$12.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively. As of December&#160;31, 2011, there was approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$27.1 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company&#8217;s stock incentive plans. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">2.8</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;years.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In October 2011, the Compensation Committee approved certain modifications to awards outstanding under the stock incentive plans. The approved modifications included extending the lives of certain previously-granted stock option awards and providing for post-retirement vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock units to qualifying individuals. The Company recognized </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$7.3 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in non-cash stock-based compensation expense relating to these modifications in the fourth quarter of 2011.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In November 2011, the Compensation Committee granted certain members of senior management a total of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> market performance-based stock options that consist of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">three</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> tranches. Provided that certain service requirements are satisfied, these tranches vest and become exercisable, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which ACI&#8217;s common stock reaches certain market prices (as specified in the performance-based stock option award agreements) or (ii) the date on which a secondary vesting condition is met. The secondary vesting condition will be satisfied if the Company&#8217;s Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the award agreements) for the period from the date of grant through December 31, 2018 is greater than </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">zero</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and is higher than the Total Shareholder Return of each of the specified peer companies.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The fair value of the performance-based stock option grants was approximately </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, with a weighted-average value of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.55</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> per share.

Expected volatility is based on historical volatility trends as well as implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties. In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior. The expected life represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S.&#160;treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related assumptions, used to determine compensation cost for the Company&#8217;s non-qualified stock options consistent with

</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$71.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in goodwill related to the

style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Ameristar East Chicago in September 2007. The Company performs an annual assessment of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for Ameristar East Chicago, Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Additionally, the guidance requires an immediate impairment assessment if a change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The goodwill related to the Company&#8217;s Missouri properties was assessed during the fourth quarter of 2011 using a qualitative analysis outlined in ASU No. 2011-08 to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would lead to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair values are less than the carrying amounts. Events and circumstances considered in this review included macroeconomic conditions, new competition, temporary road construction near our properties, financial performance of the reporting units and other financial and non-financial events. Based on these factors, the Company concluded the fair value of the Missouri properties was not more likely than not less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company was not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment analysis.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company also performed an annual impairment review of  Ameristar East Chicago&#8217;s indefinite-lived gaming license in the fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2010. These reviews did not result in any impairment charges related to the gaming license.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar East Chicago&#8217;s goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of 2010. The permanent closure of a highway bridge near the East Chicago property during the fourth quarter of 2009 significantly adversely impacted forecasted financial results for the property.&#160;Closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient for many of Ameristar East Chicago&#8217;s guests and has significantly impacted the property&#8217;s business levels and operating results. This Ameristar East Chicago impairment assessment resulted in a total of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$56.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of non-cash impairment charges, with </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$21.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> relating to the goodwill and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$34.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> relating to the gaming license.&#160;The impairment charge completely eliminated the carrying value of the goodwill. The East Chicago gaming license was reduced to </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$12.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In 2009, the Company recorded a total of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$111.7 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in non-cash impairment charges for the goodwill related to the East Chicago property acquisition. The 2009 reduction in the value of the goodwill was attributable to the significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets, as well as a lowering of the Company&#8217;s growth assumptions for the property to reflect its then-current operating performance (relative to the assumptions at the time of acquisition) and the decline in general economic conditions, as well as a result of the bridge closure described above.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Intangible assets initially recorded as part of the Ameristar East Chicago acquisition included a customer list with an estimated value of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and an estimated useful life of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">five</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> years and a trade name with an estimated value of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and an estimated useful life of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">one</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> year. The East Chicago gaming license, which has an indefinite life, is not amortized.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">During the third quarter of 2010, in addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar St. Charles&#8217; HOME nightclub service mark license due to the permanent closure of the nightclub. The impairment assessments performed resulted in a total of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> of impairment charges and completely eliminated the carrying value of the license. The license was acquired by the Company in 2009 to use certain trade names and other intellectual property related to the HOME nightclub at the St. Charles property.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">For the year ended December 31, 2011, goodwill relating to the Missouri properties acquisition decreased </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. Goodwill will continue to be reduced through 2016 by annual tax benefits of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> resulting from differences in the values assigned to certain purchased assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company utilized Level 3 inputs as described in &#8220;Note 8 - Fair value measurements&#8221; to determine fair value relating to goodwill and intangible assets.</font></div></div>

Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. The Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value is determined to be less than the carrying amount, the Company is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform the two-step impairment test.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, the Company compares the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, the Company determines the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company tests its gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">See also &#8220;Note 13 - Goodwill and other intangible assets.&#8221;</font></div></div>

The Company reviews long-lived assets for such events or changes in circumstances at each balance sheet date. If a long-lived asset is to be held and used, the Company assesses recoverability based on the future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life compared to the asset&#8217;s book value. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If an impairment exists, the asset is adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or another valuation technique, such as discounted cash flow analysis. If a long-lived asset is to be sold, the asset is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, with fair value measured as discussed above.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, related to previously capitalized design costs on discontinued expansion projects.</font></div></div>

The Company disagrees with the IRS determination and has submitted a protest and a request for an appeals conference to the IRS. In January 2012, an informal ruling was released by the IRS that agreed to the Company&#8217;s current method of accounting for a portion of expenses incurred for repairs of its gaming equipment. The remaining portion of repair expenses continues to be challenged by the IRS. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions; however, there is no assurance that the taxing authorities will not propose adjustments that are different from the Company&#8217;s expected outcome and impact the provision for income taxes.</font></div></div>

Separate financial statements and certain other disclosures concerning the Guarantors are not presented because, in the opinion of management, such information is not material to investors.

Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, the Company accrues the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding guest reward point liability was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$16.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$13.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</font></div></div>

The plans permit the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units or any combination of the foregoing. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company&#8217;s cost relating to stock-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. The guidance for stock-based compensation also requires an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and updating that number based on actual forfeitures.</font></div></div>

By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company&#8217;s judgments are based in part on its historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Cash and cash equivalents</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> deposited in a trust account as collateral for the Company&#8217;s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the Company&#8217;s workers&#8217; compensation claims. The Company is permitted to invest the trust funds in certain investment vehicles with stated maturity dates not to exceed six months. Any interest or other earnings are disbursed to the Company. The Company utilized Level 1 inputs as described in &#8220;Note 8 - Fair value measurements&#8221; to determine fair value.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Accounts receivable</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company&#8217;s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the financial statements as an operating expense. Management believes that as of December&#160;31, 2011, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivable were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$8.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.&#160;Gaming receivables were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance.&#160;As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, an allowance of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, has been applied to reduce total accounts receivable to amounts anticipated to be collected.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Inventories</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Inventories primarily consist of food and beverage items, gift shop and general store retail merchandise, engineering and slot supplies, uniforms, linens, china and other general supplies.

When no debt is incurred specifically for construction projects, interest is capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of the Company&#8217;s outstanding borrowings.

The Company reviews long-lived assets for such events or changes in circumstances at each balance sheet date. If a long-lived asset is to be held and used, the Company assesses recoverability based on the future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life compared to the asset&#8217;s book value. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If an impairment exists, the asset is adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or another valuation technique, such as discounted cash flow analysis. If a long-lived asset is to be sold, the asset is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, with fair value measured as discussed above.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, related to previously capitalized design costs on discontinued expansion projects.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Goodwill and other intangible assets</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. The Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not the reporting unit&#8217;s fair value is determined to be less than the carrying amount, the Company is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform the two-step impairment test.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, the Company compares the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, the Company determines the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company tests its gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method.

The Company expenses debt issuance costs proportionately in connection with any early debt retirements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Derivative instruments and hedging activities</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. For a derivative such as an interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings.&#160;To the extent the effective portion of a hedge subsequently becomes ineffective, the corresponding amount of the change in fair value of the derivative initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified and is recognized directly in earnings.&#160;Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of a hypothetical designated perfect hedged item or transaction.&#160;If the change in the actual swap is greater than the change in the hypothetical perfect swap, the difference is referred to as &#8220;ineffectiveness&#8221; and is recognized in earnings in the current period.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Revenue recognition</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">Casino revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons. Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue upon the occupancy of its hotel rooms, upon the delivery of food, beverage and other services and upon performance for entertainment revenue. The retail value of hotel accommodations, food and beverage items and entertainment provided to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues. Promotional allowances consist of the retail value of complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment, progress towards earning points for cash-based loyalty programs and targeted direct mail

rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests&#8217; gaming activity. Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, the Company accrues the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding guest reward point liability was </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$16.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$13.9 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company&#8217;s gaming guests may be awarded cash, hotel and food coupons based, in part, on their gaming play volume. The coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period (generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons). There is no ability to renew or extend the offer.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company&#8217;s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) and other tax authorities in the locations where the Company operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) 740, which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not (i.e., the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%) to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; standard, it is required that the tax position be derecognized. As applicable, the Company recognizes accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Earnings (loss) per share</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing reported earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and restricted stock units. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, all outstanding options with an exercise price lower than the average market price for the period have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company&#8217;s cost relating to stock-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. The guidance for stock-based compensation also requires an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and updating that number based on actual forfeitures.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Recently adopted accounting pronouncements</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ASU No. 2010-16, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No.&#160;2010-16, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, the Company reduced its recorded accrual by </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> (</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ASU No. 2011-04</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The FASB issued ASU No.&#160;2011-04, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;) requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements. The update became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ASU No. 2011-05</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> The FASB issued ASU No.&#160;2011-05, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in June 2011. This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders&#8217; equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders&#8217; equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011.

This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.</font></div></div>

Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company&#8217;s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the financial statements as an operating expense. Management believes that as of December&#160;31, 2011, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivable were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$8.8 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively.&#160;Gaming receivables were </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.2 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$4.0 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in the Company&#8217;s accounts receivable balance.&#160;As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, an allowance of </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$0.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> and </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$1.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">, respectively, has been applied to reduce total accounts receivable to amounts anticipated to be collected.</font></div></div>

The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, the Company reduced its recorded accrual by </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$5.6 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> (</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;color:#000000;text-decoration:none;">$3.4 million</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ASU No. 2011-04</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The FASB issued ASU No.&#160;2011-04, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">. The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (&#8220;IFRS&#8221;) requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements.

This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders&#8217; equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders&#8217; equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Since the update only requires a change in presentation, the early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:left;text-indent:16px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">ASU No. 2011-08</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-top:9px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:10pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">The FASB issued ASU No.&#160;2011-08, </font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;"> in September 2011. This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.</font></div></div>

                 This element represents the total of accruals as of the date of the statement of financial position for interest recognized for an underpayment of income taxes computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between a tax position recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return of the entity and the amount of statutory penalties for a tax position claimed or expected to be claimed by the entity, in its tax return, that does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties.

                Significant Accounting Policies [Text Block]
         Summary of significant accounting policies
Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company’s judgments are based in part on its historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value, due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
Restricted cash
On September 2, 2003, the Company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has 
$5.9 million
 deposited in a trust account as collateral for the Company’s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the Company’s workers’ compensation claims. The Company is permitted to invest the trust funds in certain investment vehicles with stated maturity dates not to exceed six months. Any interest or other earnings are disbursed to the Company. The Company utilized Level 1 inputs as described in “Note 8 - Fair value measurements” to determine fair value.
Accounts receivable
Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the financial statements as an operating expense. Management believes that as of December 31, 2011, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivable were 
$5.8 million
 and 
$8.8 million
, respectively. Gaming receivables were 
$1.2 million
 and 
$4.0 million
 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are included in the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, an allowance of 
$0.4 million
 and 
$1.4 million
, respectively, has been applied to reduce total accounts receivable to amounts anticipated to be collected.
Inventories
Inventories primarily consist of food and beverage items, gift shop and general store retail merchandise, engineering and slot supplies, uniforms, linens, china and other general supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on the weighted-average basis.
Capitalization and depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, including capitalized interest cost associated with major development and construction projects. When no debt is incurred specifically for construction projects, interest is capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period. Interest of 
$0.5 million
, 
$0.7 million
 and 
$9.0 million
 was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Betterments, renewals and repairs that either materially add to the value of an asset or appreciably extend its useful life are capitalized. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of major renovation projects are capitalized in accordance with existing policies.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method. Amortization of building and furniture, fixtures and equipment under capitalized leases is provided over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the associated lease (including lease renewals or purchase options the Company expects to exercise). Depreciation and amortization is provided over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings and improvements        
5
 to 
40
 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment        
3
 to 
10
 years
Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Impairment of long-lived assets 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews long-lived assets for such events or changes in circumstances at each balance sheet date. If a long-lived asset is to be held and used, the Company assesses recoverability based on the future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life compared to the asset’s book value. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If an impairment exists, the asset is adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or another valuation technique, such as discounted cash flow analysis. If a long-lived asset is to be sold, the asset is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, with fair value measured as discussed above.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of 
$0.2 million
, 
$0.2 million
 and 
$3.8 million
, respectively, related to previously capitalized design costs on discontinued expansion projects.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. 
The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. The Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than the carrying amount, the Company is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform the two-step impairment test.
Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, the Company compares the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, the Company determines the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.
The Company tests its gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.
See also “Note 13 - Goodwill and other intangible assets.”
Debt issuance costs
Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method or a method that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt instrument. The Company expenses debt issuance costs proportionately in connection with any early debt retirements.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. For a derivative such as an interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. To the extent the effective portion of a hedge subsequently becomes ineffective, the corresponding amount of the change in fair value of the derivative initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified and is recognized directly in earnings. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of a hypothetical designated perfect hedged item or transaction. If the change in the actual swap is greater than the change in the hypothetical perfect swap, the difference is referred to as “ineffectiveness” and is recognized in earnings in the current period.
Revenue recognition
Casino revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons. Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue upon the occupancy of its hotel rooms, upon the delivery of food, beverage and other services and upon performance for entertainment revenue. The retail value of hotel accommodations, food and beverage items and entertainment provided to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues. Promotional allowances consist of the retail value of complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment, progress towards earning points for cash-based loyalty programs and targeted direct mail coin coupons.
The estimated departmental costs of providing complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment and other are included in casino operating expenses and consisted of the following:

Guest Rewards Programs
The Company’s guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests’ gaming activity. Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, the Company accrues the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding guest reward point liability was 
$16.0 million
 and 
$13.9 million
, respectively.
Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons
The Company’s gaming guests may be awarded cash, hotel and food coupons based, in part, on their gaming play volume. The coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period (generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons). There is no ability to renew or extend the offer. The Company recognizes a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed.
Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately 
$30.3 million
, 
$26.1 million
 and 
$27.6 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Income taxes
The guidance for income taxes requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The Company’s income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in the locations where the Company operates. The Company assesses potentially unfavorable outcomes of such examinations based on the criteria of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, which prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. The guidance utilizes a two-step approach for evaluating tax positions. Recognition (Step I) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based on its technical merits, is more likely than not (i.e., the likelihood of occurrence is greater than 50%) to be sustained upon examination. Measurement (Step II) is only addressed if the position is deemed to be more likely than not to be sustained. Under Step II, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
The tax positions that fail to qualify for initial recognition are to be recognized in the first subsequent interim period in which they meet the “more likely than not” standard. If it is subsequently determined that a previously recognized tax position no longer meets the “more likely than not” standard, it is required that the tax position be derecognized. As applicable, the Company recognizes accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
Earnings (loss) per share
The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing reported earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and restricted stock units. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, all outstanding options with an exercise price lower than the average market price for the period have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted loss per share excludes the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options and restricted stock units.
The weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share consisted of the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the potentially dilutive stock options excluded from the earnings (loss) per share computation, as their effect would be anti-dilutive, totaled 
2.5 million
, 
3.3 million
 and 
3.2 million
, respectively.
Accounting for stock-based compensation
The Company has various stock incentive plans for directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisers of the Company.  The plans permit the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units or any combination of the foregoing. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company’s cost relating to stock-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. The guidance for stock-based compensation also requires an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and updating that number based on actual forfeitures.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
ASU No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
. The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, the Company reduced its recorded accrual by 
$5.6 million
 (
$3.4 million
 net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.
ASU No. 2011-04
, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
. The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements. The update became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-05
, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, 
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 in June 2011. This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Since the update only requires a change in presentation, the early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-08
, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 in September 2011. This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

         Basis of presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. (“ACI”) and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). Through its subsidiaries, the Company owns and operates 
eight
 casino properties in 
seven
 markets. The Company’s portfolio of casinos consists of: Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles (serving the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City (serving the Kansas City metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs (serving the Omaha, Nebraska metropolitan area and southwestern Iowa); Ameristar Casino Resort Spa Black Hawk (serving the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area); Ameristar Casino Hotel Vicksburg (serving Jackson, Mississippi and Monroe, Louisiana); Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago (serving the Chicagoland area); and Cactus Petes Resort Casino and The Horseshu Hotel and Casino in Jackpot, Nevada (serving Idaho and the Pacific Northwest). The Company views each property as an operating segment and all such operating segments have been aggregated into one reporting segment. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
The Company has evaluated certain events and transactions occurring after December 31, 2011 and determined that none met the definition of a subsequent event for purposes of recognition or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2011.

The sum of the amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total for the year due to rounding.
(2)
 
Because earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per-share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total earnings (loss) per share amounts for the year.
(3)
 
In April 2011, the Company obtained 
$2.2 billion
 of new debt financing. A portion of the proceeds from the new debt financing was used to purchase 
26,150,000
 shares of ACI’s common stock held by the Estate. The share repurchase reduced the Company’s outstanding shares by approximately 
45%
. The reduction in the Company’s weighted-average shares outstanding from the Repurchase Transaction benefited 2011 diluted earnings per share by 
$0.54
.
(4)
 
As discussed in “Note 13 — Goodwill and other intangible assets,” the Company impaired a portion of the goodwill and gaming license acquired in the purchase of the East Chicago property. The pre-tax impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 totaled 
$56.0 million
. This charge adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by 
$0.56
.

                 The amount as of the balance sheet date of the estimated future tax effects attributable to the difference between the tax basis of capital assets and the basis of capital assets computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The difference in basis, attributable to different capitalization of costs, depreciation, or amortization methodologies, will increase future taxable income when such basis difference is realized. Capital assets include but are not limited to assets such as land, real estate, leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment and furniture and fixtures.

                 Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

                 The current portion of the aggregate tax effects as of the balance sheet date of all future tax deductions arising from temporary differences between tax basis and generally accepted accounting principles basis recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, which can only be deducted for tax purposes when permitted under enacted tax laws; after deducting the allocated valuation allowance, if any, to reduce such amount to net realizable value. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards, are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference. An unrecognized tax benefit that is directly related to a position taken in a tax year that results in a net operating loss carryforward is presented as a reduction of the related deferred tax asset.

                 The noncurrent portion as of the balance sheet date of the aggregate carrying amount of all future tax deductions arising from temporary differences between tax basis and generally accepted accounting principles basis recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, which can only be deducted for tax purposes when permitted under enacted tax laws; after the valuation allowance, if any, to reduce such amount to net realizable value. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards, is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.

                 Represents the noncurrent portion of deferred tax liabilities, which result from applying the applicable tax rate to net taxable temporary differences pertaining to each jurisdiction to which the entity is obligated to pay income tax. A noncurrent taxable temporary difference is a difference between the tax basis and the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or liability in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In a classified statement of financial position, an enterprise separates deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards, are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.

                 Net of tax effect change in accumulated gains and losses from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as the effective portion of cash flow hedges after taxes. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction that is attributable to a particular risk. The change includes an entity's share of an equity investee's increase or decrease in deferred hedging gains or losses. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.

                 Total of all stockholders' equity (deficit) items, net of receivables from officers, directors, owners, and affiliates of the entity which are attributable to the parent. The amount of the economic entity's stockholders' equity attributable to the parent excludes the amount of stockholders' equity which is allocable to that ownership interest in subsidiary equity which is not attributable to the parent (noncontrolling interest, minority interest). This excludes temporary equity and is sometimes called permanent equity.

The sum of the amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total for the year due to rounding.
(2)
 
Because earnings (loss) per share amounts are calculated using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per-share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total earnings (loss) per share amounts for the year.

In April 2011, the Company obtained 
$2.2 billion
 of new debt financing. A portion of the proceeds from the new debt financing was used to purchase 
26,150,000
 shares of ACI’s common stock held by the Estate. The share repurchase reduced the Company’s outstanding shares by approximately 
45%
. The reduction in the Company’s weighted-average shares outstanding from the Repurchase Transaction benefited 2011 diluted earnings per share by 
$0.54
.
(4)
 
As discussed in “Note 13 — Goodwill and other intangible assets,” the Company impaired a portion of the goodwill and gaming license acquired in the purchase of the East Chicago property. The pre-tax impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of 2010 totaled 
$56.0 million
. This charge adversely impacted diluted earnings per share by 
$0.56
.

                 Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

Operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and providing services. Operating activity cash flows include transactions, adjustments, and changes in value that are not defined as investing or financing activities. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a debit balance consistent with its label.

                Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans [Text Block]
         Benefit plans
401(k) plan
The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) plan, which covers all employees who meet certain age and length of service requirements. Plan participants can elect to defer pre-tax compensation through payroll deductions. These deferrals are regulated under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches 
50%
 of eligible participants’ deferrals that do not exceed 
4%
 of their pay (subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code). The Company’s matching contributions were 
$1.8 million
, 
$2.1 million
 and 
$2.2 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Neither the 401(k) plan nor any other Company benefit plan holds or invests in shares of the Company’s common stock or derivative securities based on the Company’s common stock.
Health benefit plan
The Company maintains a qualified employee health benefit plan that is self-funded by the Company with respect to claims up to a certain amount. The plan requires contributions from eligible employees and their dependents. The Company’s contribution expense for the plan was approximately 
$28.3 million
, 
$32.0 million
 and 
$27.3 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled 
$3.4 million
, compared to 
$4.1 million
 at December 31, 2010.
Deferred compensation plan
In 2001, the Company adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain highly compensated employees, which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2008. Through the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company matched, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to the first 
5%
 of participants’ annual salary deferrals and the first 
5%
 of participants’ annual bonus deferrals in each participant's account. Matching contributions by the Company for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were 
$1.3 million
, 
$1.2 million
 and 
$0.9 million
, respectively. The Company’s obligation under the plan represents an unsecured promise to pay benefits in the future. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Company, assets of the plan would be available to satisfy the claims of general creditors. To increase the security of the participants’ deferred compensation plan benefits, the Company has established and funded a grantor trust (known as a “rabbi trust”). The rabbi trust is specifically designed so that assets are available to pay plan benefits to participants in the event the Company is unwilling or unable to pay the plan benefits for any reason other than bankruptcy or insolvency. As a result, the Company is prevented from withdrawing or accessing assets for corporate needs. Plan participants choose to receive a return on their account balances equal to the return on various investment options. The Company currently invests plan assets in an equity-based life insurance product of which the rabbi trust is the owner and beneficiary.
Effective December 31, 2011, ACI’s Board of Directors terminated the deferred compensation plan. A partial distribution of plan assets was made to participants in May 2011. The Company anticipates making a final distribution of plan assets to participants in the second quarter of 2012. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, plan assets were 
$15.3 million
 and 
$18.2 million
, respectively, and are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the 2011 presentation and deposits and other assets in the 2010 presentation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities due the participants were 
$12.8 million
 and 
$15.7 million
 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the liability balance is reflected in accrued liabilities and in 2010, it is reflected in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, net deferred compensation expense was 
$2.1 million
, 
$1.4 million
 and 
$0.8 million
, respectively.

                Disclosure of Compensation Related Costs, Share-based Payments
         Stock-based compensation
The Company provides benefits to its employees in the form of stock-based payments, such as grants of stock options and restricted stock units, whereby employees render service in exchange for shares or rights to shares. The maximum number of shares available for issuance under the currently effective plan is 
9.1 million
, subject to certain limitations. At December 31, 2011, 
4.4 million
 shares were available for issuance. The Compensation Committee of ACI’s Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”) administers the Company’s stock incentive plans and has broad discretion to establish the terms of stock awards, including, without limitation, the power to set the term (up to 
10
 years), vesting schedule and exercise price of stock options.
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, total stock-based compensation expense was 
$24.3 million
, 
$14.3 million
 and 
$12.9 million
, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately 
$27.1 million
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.8
 years.
In October 2011, the Compensation Committee approved certain modifications to awards outstanding under the stock incentive plans. The approved modifications included extending the lives of certain previously-granted stock option awards and providing for post-retirement vesting of certain stock options and restricted stock units to qualifying individuals. The Company recognized 
$7.3 million
 in non-cash stock-based compensation expense relating to these modifications in the fourth quarter of 2011.
In November 2011, the Compensation Committee granted certain members of senior management a total of 
1.2 million
 market performance-based stock options that consist of 
three
 tranches. Provided that certain service requirements are satisfied, these tranches vest and become exercisable, if at all, on the earlier of (i) the date on which ACI’s common stock reaches certain market prices (as specified in the performance-based stock option award agreements) or (ii) the date on which a secondary vesting condition is met. The secondary vesting condition will be satisfied if the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (as defined in the award agreements) for the period from the date of grant through December 31, 2018 is greater than 
zero
 and is higher than the Total Shareholder Return of each of the specified peer companies.
The fair value of the performance-based stock option grants was approximately 
$5.2 million
, with a weighted-average value of 
$4.55
 per share. The annual amortization expense related to these options is estimated to be approximately 
$1.3 million
, with approximately 
$0.1 million
 recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Stock options
Stock options are valued at the date of award, which does not precede the approval date, and compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. The outstanding time-vested stock options generally vest over 
four
 years and have 
10
-year contractual terms.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 
$3.7 million
, 
$2.5 million
 and 
$2.4 million
, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding was 
$5.5 million
, 
$4.4 million
 and 
$6.1 million
 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercisable at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was 
$4.1 million
, 
$3.4 million
 and 
$4.6 million
, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that would have been realized by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on the applicable date. The intrinsic value of a stock option is the excess of the Company’s closing stock price on that date over the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options.
At December 31, 2011, the weighted-average remaining contractual life for stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable was 
6.3
 years and 
4.2
 years, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount of cash received by the Company from the exercise of stock options was 
$7.3 million
, 
$2.2 million
 and 
$2.1 million
, respectively.
The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility trends as well as implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties. In determining the expected life of the option grants, the Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior. The expected life represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. The following table sets forth fair value per share information, including related assumptions, used to determine compensation cost for the Company’s non-qualified stock options consistent with the requirements of ASC Topic 718.

Restricted stock units
For each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company granted restricted stock units in addition to stock options. The value of the restricted stock units at the date of grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. The requisite service period for the restricted stock units that were granted is generally 
four
 years. The Company uses historical data to estimate employee forfeitures, which are compared to actual forfeitures on a quarterly basis and adjusted if necessary.

At December 31, 2011, the Company had available 
$250.8 million
 of state net operating loss carryforwards that relate to the Company’s Missouri properties and may be applied against future taxable income. The Company also had available 
$12.0 million
 of additional Colorado net operating losses that relate to the post-acquisition period for the Ameristar Black Hawk property. In general, the remaining unused federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2020 through 2029. No valuation allowance has been provided against deferred income tax assets as the Company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, availability of tax strategies and future projected taxable income.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total amount of unrecognized benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized was 
$1.7 million
 and 
$1.1 million
, respectively.
Interest and penalties related to income taxes are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2011, accrued interest and penalties totaled 
$0.8 million
, of which 
$0.5 million
 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. As of December 31, 2010, accrued interest and penalties totaled 
$0.7 million
, of which 
$0.5 million
 would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
The Company files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions. The statutes of limitations vary by jurisdiction, with certain of these statutes expiring without examination each year. With the normal expiration of statutes of limitations, the Company anticipates that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by 
$0.6 million
 within the next 12 months. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal or state examinations by taxing authorities for years ended on or before December 31, 2006.
The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2009 are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). In May 2011, the IRS issued a letter challenging the Company’s method of accounting for certain repair and maintenance expenses. The Company disagrees with the IRS determination and has submitted a protest and a request for an appeals conference to the IRS. In January 2012, an informal ruling was released by the IRS that agreed to the Company’s current method of accounting for a portion of expenses incurred for repairs of its gaming equipment. The remaining portion of repair expenses continues to be challenged by the IRS. 
The Company believes it has adequately reserved for its uncertain tax positions; however, there is no assurance that the taxing authorities will not propose adjustments that are different from the Company’s expected outcome and impact the provision for income taxes.

                Accounting Policies [Abstract]
          
       
                Use of Estimates, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Use of estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate estimates and assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company’s judgments are based in part on its historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
       
                Cash and Cash Equivalents, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair market value, due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
       
                Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Restricted cash
On September 2, 2003, the Company entered into a trust participation agreement with an insurance provider. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has 
$5.9 million
 deposited in a trust account as collateral for the Company’s obligation to reimburse the insurance provider for the Company’s workers’ compensation claims. The Company is permitted to invest the trust funds in certain investment vehicles with stated maturity dates not to exceed six months. Any interest or other earnings are disbursed to the Company. The Company utilized Level 1 inputs as described in “Note 8 - Fair value measurements” to determine fair value.
       
                Trade and Other Accounts Receivable, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Accounts receivable
Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in the financial statements as an operating expense. Management believes that as of December 31, 2011, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, total accounts receivable were 
$5.8 million
 and 
$8.8 million
, respectively. Gaming receivables were 
$1.2 million

                Inventory, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Inventories
Inventories primarily consist of food and beverage items, gift shop and general store retail merchandise, engineering and slot supplies, uniforms, linens, china and other general supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined principally on the weighted-average basis.
       
                Property, Plant and Equipment, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Capitalization and depreciation
Property and equipment are recorded at cost, including capitalized interest cost associated with major development and construction projects. When no debt is incurred specifically for construction projects, interest is capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or construction activity is suspended for more than a brief period. Interest of 
$0.5 million
, 
$0.7 million
 and 
$9.0 million
 was capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Betterments, renewals and repairs that either materially add to the value of an asset or appreciably extend its useful life are capitalized. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs of major renovation projects are capitalized in accordance with existing policies.
Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method. Amortization of building and furniture, fixtures and equipment under capitalized leases is provided over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the associated lease (including lease renewals or purchase options the Company expects to exercise). Depreciation and amortization is provided over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings and improvements        
5
 to 
40
 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment        
3
 to 
10
 years
Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
       
                Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Impairment of long-lived assets 
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company reviews long-lived assets for such events or changes in circumstances at each balance sheet date. If a long-lived asset is to be held and used, the Company assesses recoverability based on the future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset over the remaining life compared to the asset’s book value. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If an impairment exists, the asset is adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or another valuation technique, such as discounted cash flow analysis. If a long-lived asset is to be sold, the asset is reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, with fair value measured as discussed above.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of 
$0.2 million
, 
$0.2 million
 and 
$3.8 million
, respectively, related to previously capitalized design costs on discontinued expansion projects.
       
                Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Other intangible assets include gaming licenses, trade names and player lists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances. 
The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment by qualitatively evaluating events and circumstances that have occurred since the last quantitative test. The Company considers both positive and negative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry events, financial performance and other changes, and makes a determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit being tested is less than its carrying amount. If it is more likely than not the reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than the carrying amount, the Company is required to perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. If, based on the qualitative analysis, the fair value is more likely than not to be greater than the carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform the two-step impairment test.
Under the two-step quantitative assessment, goodwill is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit. Under the first step, the Company compares the estimated fair value of  the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value in step one, step two of the impairment test is performed. In step two, the Company determines the implied value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value, the excess carrying amount is recorded as an impairment charge.
The Company tests its gaming license indefinite-lived intangible asset annually using a discounted cash flow method. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.

                Debt, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Debt issuance costs
Debt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method or a method that approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt instrument. The Company expenses debt issuance costs proportionately in connection with any early debt retirements.
       
                Derivatives, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Derivative instruments and hedging activities
The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. For a derivative such as an interest rate swap that is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheet and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. To the extent the effective portion of a hedge subsequently becomes ineffective, the corresponding amount of the change in fair value of the derivative initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is reclassified and is recognized directly in earnings. Accordingly, on a quarterly basis, the Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of a hypothetical designated perfect hedged item or transaction. If the change in the actual swap is greater than the change in the hypothetical perfect swap, the difference is referred to as “ineffectiveness” and is recognized in earnings in the current period.
       
                Revenue Recognition, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Revenue recognition
Casino revenues consist of the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between amounts wagered and amounts paid to winning patrons. Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue upon the occupancy of its hotel rooms, upon the delivery of food, beverage and other services and upon performance for entertainment revenue. The retail value of hotel accommodations, food and beverage items and entertainment provided to guests without charge is included in gross revenues and then deducted as promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues. Promotional allowances consist of the retail value of complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment, progress towards earning points for cash-based loyalty programs and targeted direct mail coin coupons.
The estimated departmental costs of providing complimentary food and beverage, rooms, entertainment and other are included in casino operating expenses and consisted of the following:

                Revenue Recognition, Loyalty Programs [Policy Text Block]
         Guest Rewards Programs
The Company’s guest rewards programs allow guests to earn certain point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the guests’ gaming activity. Guests can accumulate reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the programs. The reward credit balance is forfeited if a guest does not earn any reward credits over the subsequent 12-month period. As a result of the ability of the guest to bank the reward points, the Company accrues the expense of reward points, after giving effect to estimated forfeitures, as they are earned. The accruals are based on historical data, estimates and assumptions regarding the mix of rewards that will be redeemed and the costs of providing those rewards. The retail value of the point-based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services is netted against revenue as a promotional allowance. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the outstanding guest reward point liability was 
$16.0 million
 and 
$13.9 million
, respectively.
       
                Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons Accounting Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Cash, Hotel and Food Coupons
The Company’s gaming guests may be awarded cash, hotel and food coupons based, in part, on their gaming play volume. The coupons are provided on a discretionary basis to induce future play and are redeemable within a short time period (generally seven days for cash coupons and one month for hotel and food coupons). There is no ability to renew or extend the offer. The Company recognizes a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed.
       
                Advertising Costs, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Advertising
The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was approximately 
$30.3 million
, 
$26.1 million
 and 
$27.6 million
 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
       
                Income Tax, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Income taxes
The guidance for income taxes requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
       
                Earnings Per Share, Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Earnings (loss) per share
The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260. Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing reported earnings (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and restricted stock units. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, all outstanding options with an exercise price lower than the average market price for the period have been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. For the year ended December 31, 2009, diluted loss per share excludes the additional dilution from all potentially dilutive securities such as stock options and restricted stock units.
The weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share consisted of the following:

2.5 million
, 
3.3 million
 and 
3.2 million
, respectively.
       
                Share-based Compensation, Option and Incentive Plans Policy [Policy Text Block]
         Accounting for stock-based compensation
The Company has various stock incentive plans for directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisers of the Company.  The plans permit the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share units or any combination of the foregoing. In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Company’s cost relating to stock-based payment transactions is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of each time-vested option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, while the fair value of market performance-based stock options is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The models require estimates for expected volatility, expected dividends, the risk-free interest rate and the expected term of the equity grant. The cost is measured at the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award, and is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. The guidance for stock-based compensation also requires an estimate of the number of awards that will be forfeited and updating that number based on actual forfeitures.
       
                Recent Accounting Pronouncements [Policy Text Block]
         Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
ASU No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-16, 
Entertainment-Casinos (Topic 924): Accruals for Casino Jackpot Liabilities
. The guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof) before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots. The guidance became effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010. As required under this guidance, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Under the gaming regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the removal of base jackpots is not prohibited and upon adoption, the Company reduced its recorded accrual by 
$5.6 million
 (
$3.4 million
 net of tax) with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings.
ASU No. 2011-04
, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS
. The guidance amends and converges U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures regarding these measurements. The update became effective in the fourth quarter of 2011. The adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-05
, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, 
Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income
 in June 2011. This update changes the requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income, eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity, among other items. The guidance requires that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB deferred the requirement for companies to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements in ASU No. 2011-12; however, the presentation requirement under ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Since the update only requires a change in presentation, the early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2011-08
, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
The FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment
 in September 2011. This update simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount by assessing qualitative factors. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The early adoption of this Topic did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

                 Disclosure of accounting policy for revenue recognition. If the entity has different policies for different types of revenue transactions, the policy for each material type of transaction is generally disclosed. If a sales transaction has multiple element arrangements (for example, delivery of multiple products, services or the rights to use assets) the disclosure may indicate the accounting policy for each unit of accounting as well as how units of accounting are determined and valued. The disclosure may encompass important judgment as to appropriateness of principles related to recognition of revenue. The disclosure also may indicate the entity's treatment of any unearned or deferred revenue that arises from the transaction.

         Stock repurchases
On April 19, 2011, ACI purchased 
26,150,000
 shares of its common stock held by the Estate at 
$17.50
 per share, for a total of 
$457.6 million
. The purchase was made pursuant to a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) entered into by ACI and the Estate on March 25, 2011, following the execution of a binding letter agreement entered into on February 27, 2011. The shares purchased represented approximately 
45%
 of ACI’s outstanding shares and 
83%
 of the Estate’s holdings in the Company at the time of the purchase.
On September 15, 2011, ACI’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 
$75 million
 of ACI’s common stock in a stock repurchase program. The program provides that the shares may be repurchased by the Company through September 30, 2014 in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at the Company’s discretion, subject to market conditions and other factors. The Company expects to fund repurchases using available cash and its existing senior credit facility. The Company is not obligated to purchase any shares under the stock repurchase program, and purchases may be discontinued, or the stock repurchase program may be modified or terminated, at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company repurchased 
0.3 million
 shares under the stock repurchase program for 
$5.2 million
 at an average price of 
$16.23
 per share, exclusive of commissions paid. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock in open market transactions. 
The Company additionally received treasury shares in satisfaction of employees’ income tax withholding liability with respect to the settlement of certain restricted stock units. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate cost of treasury shares received for these tax withholding obligations totaled 
$6.8 million
. 
As of December 31, 2011, a total of 
27.6 million
 treasury shares had been acquired at an aggregate cost of 
$487.2 million
, an average of 
$17.65
 per share.

         Fair value measurements
The Company measures the fair value of its deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities on a recurring basis pursuant to ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:
Level 1:

The fair value of the deferred compensation assets is based on the cash surrender value of rabbi trust-owned life insurance policies, which are invested in variable life insurance separate accounts that are similar to mutual funds. These investments are in the same accounts and purchased in substantially the same amounts as the deferred compensation plan participants’ selected investments, which represent the underlying liabilities to participants. Liabilities under the deferred compensation plan are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’ selected investments.

On April 14, 2011, ACI obtained 
$2.2 billion
 of new debt financing (the “Debt Refinancing”), consisting of a 
$1.4 billion
 senior secured credit facility (the “New Credit Facility”) and 
$800.0 million
 principal amount of unsecured 
7.50%
 senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”). The New Credit Facility consists of (i) a 
$200 million
 A term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in April 2016, (ii) a 
$700 million
 B term loan that was fully borrowed at closing and matures in April 2018 and (iii) a 
$500 million
 revolving loan facility, 
$368 million
 of which was borrowed at closing and which matures in April 2016. The 2021 Notes were sold at a price of 
99.125%
 of the principal amount, and the 
$700.0 million
 B term loan was sold at a price of 
99.75%
 of the principal amount. Upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, ACI has the option to increase the total amount available under the New Credit Facility by up to the greater of an additional 
$200 million
 or an amount determined by reference to the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement).
The A term loan and the revolving loan facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 
2.75%
 per annum or the base rate plus 
1.75%
 per annum, at ACI’s option. The B term loan bears interest at LIBOR (subject to a LIBOR floor of 
1.0%
) plus 
3.0%
 per annum or the base rate (subject to a base rate floor of 
2.0%
) plus 
2.0%
 per annum, at ACI’s option. The LIBOR margin for the A term loan and the revolving loan facility is subject to reduction based on the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement. ACI pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility of 
0.50%
 per annum, which is subject to reduction based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio.
The New Credit Facility agreement requires certain mandatory principal repayments prior to maturity for both term loans. The A term loan requires the following principal amortization: 
3.75%
 in 2012; 
12.5%
 in 2013; 
18.75%
 in 2014; 
50%
 in 2015; and the remaining 
15%
 in 2016. The B term loan requires mandatory principal reductions of 
1%
 per annum, with the remaining 
93.25%
 due at maturity. In addition to the scheduled mandatory principal repayments of the term loans, the New Credit Facility agreement also requires permanent principal repayments of the term loans equal to 
25%
 of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement) if the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio is above 
4.75
:1 at year-end. Excess Cash Flow repayments are required to be made 120 days after the last day of each fiscal year and are allocated between both term loans on a pro-rata basis. The Company expects the Excess Cash Flow repayment for the year ended December 31, 2011 to be approximately 
$8.6 million
.
At 
December 31, 2011
, the Company’s principal debt outstanding under the New Credit Facility consisted of 
$239.0 million
 under the revolving loan facility, 
$200.0 million
 under the A term loan facility and 
$693.2 million
 (net of discount) under the B term loan facility. All mandatory principal repayments have been made through 
December 31, 2011
. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the amount of the revolving loan facility available for borrowing was 
$257.0 million
, after giving effect to 
$4.0 million
 of outstanding letters of credit.
In connection with obtaining the New Credit Facility, certain of ACI’s subsidiaries, including each of its material subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), entered into a guaranty (the “Guaranty”) pursuant to which the Guarantors guaranteed ACI’s obligations under the New Credit Facility. The obligations of ACI under the New Credit Facility, and of the Guarantors under the Guaranty, are secured by substantially all of the assets of ACI and the Guarantors.
The terms of the 2021 Notes are governed by an indenture. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
7.50%
 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, with the initial interest payment made on October 15, 2011. The 2021 Notes mature on April 15, 2021. The 2021 Notes and the guarantees of the 2021 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ACI and the Guarantors, respectively, and rank, in right of payment, equally with or senior to all existing or future unsecured indebtedness of ACI and each Guarantor, respectively, but are effectively subordinated in right of payment to the New Credit Facility indebtedness and any future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.
The Guarantors have jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed the 2021 Notes. Each of the Guarantors is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ACI, and the Guarantors constitute substantially all of ACI’s direct and indirect subsidiaries. ACI is a holding company with no operations or material assets independent of those of the Guarantors and, other than its investment in the Guarantors, the aggregate assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of the Guarantors are substantially equivalent to the assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of the Company on a consolidated basis. Separate financial statements and certain other disclosures concerning the Guarantors are not presented because, in the opinion of management, such information is not material to investors. Other than customary restrictions imposed by applicable statutes, there are no restrictions on the ability of the Guarantors to transfer funds to ACI in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.
Proceeds from the Debt Refinancing were used to (i) repurchase substantially all of ACI’s outstanding 
9.25%
 Senior Notes due 2014 tendered pursuant to ACI’s tender offer announced on March 29, 2011, including payment of the tender premium and accrued interest, (ii) prepay and permanently retire all of the indebtedness under the prior senior secured credit facility dated as of November 10, 2005 (and all commitments under the replaced senior secured credit facility were terminated), (iii) purchase 
26,150,000
 shares of ACI’s common stock from the Estate of Craig H. Neilsen (the “Estate”) and (iv) pay related fees and expenses.
In connection with the Debt Refinancing, the Company paid one-time fees and expenses totaling approximately 
$30.8 million
, most of which was capitalized and will be amortized over the respective remaining terms of the 2021 Notes and New Credit Facility. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, approximately 
$85.3 million
 relating to the tender premium and deferred debt issuance costs were expensed as a result of the early retirement of debt.
Debt covenants
The agreement governing the New Credit Facility requires the Company to comply with various affirmative and negative financial and other covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, restrictions on dividend payments and other restrictions and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios and tests. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company was required to maintain a Total Net Leverage Ratio, calculated as consolidated debt (net of certain cash and cash equivalents) divided by EBITDA, as defined in the New Credit Facility agreement, of no more than 
7.00
:1, and a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, calculated as senior secured debt (net of certain cash and cash equivalents) divided by EBITDA, of no more than 
4.50
:1. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company’s Total Net Leverage Ratio was 
5.04
:1. The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as of 
December 31, 2011
 was 
2.86
:1. Under the New Credit Facility, as of 
December 31, 2011
, the Company was required to maintain an Interest Expense Coverage Ratio, calculated as EBITDA divided by cash interest expense, of at least 
2.00
:1. As of 
December 31, 2011
, the Interest Expense Coverage Ratio was 
3.29
:1.
The New Credit Facility permits the Company to make annual dividend payments of up to 
$12.0 million
 from April 14, 2011 through December 31, 2011 and up to 
$16.0 million
 during any fiscal year thereafter, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. For the year ended 
December 31, 2011
, the Company paid dividends totaling 
$16.4 million
, of which 
$10.3 million
 was paid after April 14, 2011.
The New Credit Facility limits the Company’s capital expenditures to 
$80.0 million
 during any fiscal year through the final maturity of the New Credit Facility, with any unused portion of such amount permitted to be carried over to future years. As of 
December 31, 2011
, capital expenditures made during the term of the New Credit Facility totaled 
$69.3 million
.
The indenture governing the 2021 Notes contains covenants that limit ACI’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ (as defined in the indenture) ability to, among other things, (i) pay dividends or make distributions, repurchase equity securities, prepay subordinated debt or make certain investments, (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock or preferred stock, (iii) create liens on assets, (iv) merge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets and (v) enter into transactions with affiliates.  In addition, pursuant to the indenture, if ACI experiences certain changes of control, each holder of the 2021 Notes can require ACI to repurchase all or a portion of such holder’s outstanding 2021 Notes at a price of 
101%
 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facilities and the senior notes outstanding at the respective dates.

                Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Disclosure [Abstract]
          
       
                Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
         
Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the guidance under ASC Topic 815. The guidance provides users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under the previous guidance and its related interpretations and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In 2008, the Company entered into two forward interest rate swaps with two different commercial banks to fix the interest rate on certain LIBOR-based borrowings under its credit facility. Both swaps were designated as cash flow hedges. Pursuant to each of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company was obligated to make quarterly fixed rate payments to the counterparty, while the counterparty was obligated to make quarterly variable rate payments to the Company based on three-month LIBOR on the same notional amount.
The Company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently does not have any derivatives in place.
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the interest rate swap liability was 
zero
 due to the expiration of both interest rate swap agreements on July 19, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the swaps increased the Company’s interest expense by 
$16.8 million
.
There was no net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net tax effect on other comprehensive income for the interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 
$10.6 million
.
The Company may enter into additional swap transactions or other interest rate protection agreements in the future, although it has no current intention to do so.

                Commitments and Contingencies Disclosure
         Commitments and contingencies
Litigation
. From time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, most of which arises in the ordinary course of business. The Company is not currently a party to any litigation that management believes would be likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
East Chicago Local Development Agreement
. Pursuant to a Modified Local Development Agreement (the “Modified LDA”), for the period beginning June 3, 2011, Ameristar Casino East Chicago, LLC (“ACEC”) is required to pay 1.625% of its adjusted gross receipts from operation of the casino (“AGR”) to the City of East Chicago, Indiana (the “City”) and 1.625% of its AGR to Foundations of East Chicago, Inc., an Indiana not-for-profit corporation (“FEC”), to be used by the recipients solely to support and assist economic development in the City through specified initiatives set forth in the Modified LDA and for reasonable and necessary administrative expenses. The Modified LDA provides that ACEC will make the payments to separate and segregated bank accounts maintained by each recipient within 20 days after the last day of each calendar month; provided, however, that if directed by the Indiana Gaming Commission (the “IGC”), ACEC must make the payments to one or more held bank accounts. ACEC’s sole obligation under the Modified LDA is to make the economic development payments described above, and it has no obligation to monitor or enforce the proper use of the payments by the recipients, which is the duty of the IGC. The Modified LDA will continue in effect until the termination or expiration of the East Chicago riverboat gaming license or until any final and non-appealable order or other action is taken by the IGC to disapprove or terminate the Modified LDA. 
The Modified LDA modified and superseded in its entirety the prior local development agreement for the East Chicago casino (the “Prior LDA”), pursuant to which ACEC had been paying 2% of its AGR to FEC, 1% of its AGR to the City and 0.75% of its AGR to East Chicago Second Century, Inc., an Indiana corporation (“Second Century”), with the respective amounts payable to FEC and Second Century being deposited into two ACEC segregated bank accounts. On June 30, 2011, ACEC, the City, FEC and Second Century agreed in principle to accept the terms of the Modified LDA, allocate and distribute the funds in the two ACEC segregated bank accounts and dismiss with prejudice all pending claims against each other with respect to the Prior LDA and the Modified LDA. On September 29, 2011, the two lawsuits in which the Company was a defendant were dismissed with prejudice (except for certain claims not involving the Company). As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s East Chicago LDA liability was 
$0.7 million
 and 
$28.0 million
, respectively.
Self-Insurance Reserves.
 The Company is self-insured for various levels of general liability, workers’ compensation and employee health coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled 
$9.4 million
 and 
$10.8 million
, respectively. The Company considers historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities. The Company believes the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals; however, changes in health care costs, accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities.
Guarantees.
 In December 2000, the Company assumed several agreements with the Missouri 210 Highway Transportation Development District (“Development District”) that had been entered into in order to assist the Development District in the financing of a highway improvement project in the area around the Ameristar Kansas City property prior to the Company’s purchase of that property. In order to pay for the highway improvement project, the Development District issued revenue bonds totaling 
$9.0 million
 with scheduled maturities from 2006 through 2011.
The Company has provided an irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank in support of obligations of the Development District for certain principal and interest on the revenue bonds. The amount outstanding under this letter of credit was 
$2.6 million
 as of December 31, 2011 and may be subsequently reduced as principal and interest mature under the revenue bonds. Additionally, the Company is obligated to pay any shortfall in the event that amounts on deposit are insufficient to cover the obligations under the bonds, as well as any costs incurred by the Development District that are not payable from the taxed revenues used to satisfy the bondholders. Through December 31, 2011, the Company had paid 
$2.0 million
 in shortfalls and other costs. As required by the agreements, the Company anticipates that it will be reimbursed for these shortfall payments by the Development District from future available cash flow, as defined, and has recorded a corresponding receivable as of December 31, 2011.

                 Net of tax effect change in accumulated gains and losses from derivative instruments designated and qualifying as the effective portion of cash flow hedges after taxes. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted transaction that is attributable to a particular risk. The change includes an entity's share of an equity investee's increase or decrease in deferred hedging gains or losses. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.

         Missouri Development District receivables
In 1997, the Missouri 210 Highway Transportation Development District (the “Highway 210 District”) was formed to finance a highway improvement project near the Kansas City property prior to the Company’s purchase of that property. In December 2000, the Company purchased the Kansas City property and assumed several agreements related to the Highway 210 District, including a guarantee by the Kansas City property to fund any shortfall payments related to the Highway 210 District’s debt service obligations. Through December 31, 2011, the Company had funded 
$2.0 million
 in shortfall payments. Under the agreements, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for the shortfall payments plus accrued interest by the Highway 210 District. The Company has classified these shortfall payments as a long-term receivable included in deposits and other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and anticipates that it will be reimbursed in full from the Highway 210 District’s future available cash flows.
In 2005, the St. Charles Riverfront Transportation Development District (the “Riverfront District”) was formed to finance certain improvements to the access roads near the St. Charles property. The St. Charles Riverfront Community Improvement District was also formed in 2005 to provide incremental funding to the Riverfront District. In connection with the establishment of the Riverfront District, the Company agreed to pay certain costs associated with the road improvements and related administrative costs. Under the Riverfront District agreements, the Company is entitled to be reimbursed for these costs plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a balance due from the Riverfront District of approximately 
$14.7 million
. The Company has classified these payments as a long-term receivable included in deposits and other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and anticipates it will be reimbursed in full from the Riverfront District’s future available cash flows.

At December 31, 2011, the Company had approximately 
$71.0 million
 in goodwill related to the acquisition of the Missouri properties in December 2000 and 
$12.6 million
 in other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Ameristar East Chicago in September 2007. The Company performs an annual assessment of the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for Ameristar East Chicago, Ameristar Kansas City and Ameristar St. Charles to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Additionally, the guidance requires an immediate impairment assessment if a change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
The goodwill related to the Company’s Missouri properties was assessed during the fourth quarter of 2011 using a qualitative analysis outlined in ASU No. 2011-08 to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances would lead to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair values are less than the carrying amounts. Events and circumstances considered in this review included macroeconomic conditions, new competition, temporary road construction near our properties, financial performance of the reporting units and other financial and non-financial events. Based on these factors, the Company concluded the fair value of the Missouri properties was not more likely than not less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, the Company was not required to perform the two-step goodwill impairment analysis.
The Company also performed an annual impairment review of  Ameristar East Chicago’s indefinite-lived gaming license in the fourth quarters of both 2011 and 2010. These reviews did not result in any impairment charges related to the gaming license.
In addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar East Chicago’s goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of 2010. The permanent closure of a highway bridge near the East Chicago property during the fourth quarter of 2009 significantly adversely impacted forecasted financial results for the property. Closure of the bridge has made access to the property inconvenient for many of Ameristar East Chicago’s guests and has significantly impacted the property’s business levels and operating results. This Ameristar East Chicago impairment assessment resulted in a total of 
$56.0 million
 of non-cash impairment charges, with 
$21.4 million
 relating to the goodwill and 
$34.6 million
 relating to the gaming license. The impairment charge completely eliminated the carrying value of the goodwill. The East Chicago gaming license was reduced to 
$12.6 million
. 
In 2009, the Company recorded a total of 
$111.7 million
 in non-cash impairment charges for the goodwill related to the East Chicago property acquisition. The 2009 reduction in the value of the goodwill was attributable to the significant deterioration of the debt and equity capital markets, as well as a lowering of the Company’s growth assumptions for the property to reflect its then-current operating performance (relative to the assumptions at the time of acquisition) and the decline in general economic conditions, as well as a result of the bridge closure described above.
Intangible assets initially recorded as part of the Ameristar East Chicago acquisition included a customer list with an estimated value of 
$0.4 million
 and an estimated useful life of 
five
 years and a trade name with an estimated value of 
$1.2 million
 and an estimated useful life of 
one
 year. The East Chicago gaming license, which has an indefinite life, is not amortized.
During the third quarter of 2010, in addition to its annual fourth quarter review, the Company performed an impairment review of Ameristar St. Charles’ HOME nightclub service mark license due to the permanent closure of the nightclub. The impairment assessments performed resulted in a total of 
$0.2 million
 of impairment charges and completely eliminated the carrying value of the license. The license was acquired by the Company in 2009 to use certain trade names and other intellectual property related to the HOME nightclub at the St. Charles property.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, goodwill relating to the Missouri properties acquisition decreased 
$1.2 million
. Goodwill will continue to be reduced through 2016 by annual tax benefits of 
$1.2 million
 resulting from differences in the values assigned to certain purchased assets for financial reporting and tax purposes. 
The Company utilized Level 3 inputs as described in “Note 8 - Fair value measurements” to determine fair value relating to goodwill and intangible assets.
