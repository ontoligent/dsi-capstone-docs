FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
This report contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
which statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections,
predictions, expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Further,
forward-looking statements are intended to speak only as of the date made. Such statements are often characterized by the use of
qualifying words (and their derivatives) such as “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,”
“project,” or other statements concerning our opinions or judgment about future events. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, as they will depend on many factors about which we are unsure,
including many factors which are beyond our control. Factors that could influence the accuracy of such forward-looking statements
include, but are not limited to, the financial success or changing strategies of our customers, our level of success in integrating
acquisitions, actions of government regulators, the level of market interest rates, and general economic conditions. For additional
information about factors that could affect the matters discussed in this paragraph, see the “Risk Factors” section
in Item 1A of this report.
 
PART I
 
Item 1. Business
 
General Description
 
First Bancorp (the “Company”) is a
bank holding company. Our principal activity is the ownership and operation of First Bank (the “Bank”), a state-chartered
bank with its main office in Troy, North Carolina. The Company is also the parent to a series of statutory business trusts organized
under the laws of the State of Delaware that were created for the purpose of issuing trust preferred debt securities. Our outstanding
debt associated with these trusts was $46.4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
 
The Company was incorporated in North Carolina
on December 8, 1983, as Montgomery Bancorp, for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Bank through
a stock-for-stock exchange. On December 31, 1986, the Company changed its name to First Bancorp to conform its name to the name
of the Bank, which had changed its name from Bank of Montgomery to First Bank in 1985.
 
The Bank was organized in 1934 and began banking
operations in 1935 as the Bank of Montgomery, named for the county in which it operated. The Bank’s main office is in Troy,
population 3,500, located in the center of Montgomery County, approximately 60 miles east of Charlotte, 50 miles south of Greensboro,
and 80 miles southwest of Raleigh. As of December 31, 2011, we conducted business from 97 branches covering a geographical area
from Little River, South Carolina to the southeast, to Wilmington, North Carolina to the east, to Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina
to the northeast, to Radford, Virginia to the north, to Wytheville, Virginia to the northwest, and to Asheville, North Carolina
to the west. We also have a loan production office in Blacksburg, which is located in southwestern Virginia and represents our
furthest location to the north of Troy. Of the Bank’s 97 branches, 82 branches are in North Carolina, nine branches are in
South Carolina and six branches are in Virginia (where we operate under the name “First Bank of Virginia”). Ranked
by assets, the Bank was the fourth largest bank headquartered in North Carolina as of December 31, 2011.

On June 19, 2009, we acquired substantially all
of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank, which had been closed earlier that day by regulatory authorities. Cooperative
Bank operated through twenty-four branches located primarily in the coastal region of North Carolina. In connection with the acquisition,
we assumed assets with a book value of $959 million, including $829 million in loans and $706 million in deposits. The loans and
foreclosed real estate purchased in the acquisition are covered by loss share agreements between the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) and First Bank which affords the Bank significant loss protection. We recorded a gain of $67.9 million as a
result of this acquisition. Additional information regarding this transaction is contained in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
On January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of The Bank of Asheville, which had been closed earlier that day by regulatory authorities. The
Bank of Asheville operated through five branches located in or near Asheville, North Carolina. In connection with the acquisition,
we assumed assets with a book value of $190 million, including $154 million in loans and $192 million in deposits. Substantially
all of the acquired loans and foreclosed real-estate are covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC, which affords the Bank
significant loss protection. We recorded a gain of $10.2 million as a result of this acquisition. Additional information regarding
this transaction is also contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
As of December 31, 2011, the Bank had two wholly
owned subsidiaries, First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (“First Bank Insurance”) and First Troy SPE, LLC. First Bank
Insurance was acquired as an active insurance agency in 1994 in connection with the Company’s acquisition of a bank that
had an insurance subsidiary. On December 29, 1995, the insurance agency operations of First Bank Insurance were divested. From
December 1995 until October 1999, First Bank Insurance was inactive. In October 1999, First Bank Insurance began operations again
as a provider of non-FDIC insured investments and insurance products. Currently, First Bank Insurance’s primary business
activity is the placement of property and casualty insurance coverage. First Troy SPE, LLC, which was organized in December 2009,
is a holding entity for certain foreclosed properties.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at
341 North Main Street, Troy, North Carolina 27371-0508, and our telephone number is (910) 576-6171. Unless the context requires
otherwise, references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this annual report
on Form 10-K shall mean collectively First Bancorp and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
General Business
 
We engage in a full range of banking activities,
with the acceptance of deposits and the making of loans being our most basic activities. We offer deposit products such as checking,
savings, NOW and money market accounts, as well as time deposits, including various types of certificates of deposits (CDs) and
individual retirement accounts (IRAs). We provide loans for a wide range of consumer and commercial purposes, including loans for
business, agriculture, real estate, personal uses, home improvement and automobiles. We also offer credit cards, debit cards, letters
of credit, safe deposit box rentals and electronic funds transfer services, including wire transfers. In addition, we offer internet
banking, mobile banking, cash management and bank-by-phone capabilities to our customers, and are affiliated with ATM networks
that give our customers access to 67,000 ATMs, with no surcharge fee. In 2007, we introduced remote deposit capture, which provides
business customers with a method to electronically transmit checks received from customers into their bank account without having
to visit a branch. In 2008, we joined the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS), which gives our customers the
ability to obtain FDIC insurance on deposits of up to $50 million, while continuing to work directly with their local First Bank
branch.
 
Because the majority of our customers are individuals
and small to medium-sized businesses located in the counties we serve, management does not believe that the loss of a single customer
or group of customers would have a material adverse impact on the Bank. There are no seasonal factors that tend to have any material
effect on the Bank’s business, and we do not rely on foreign sources of funds or income. Because we operate primarily within
North Carolina, southwestern Virginia and northeastern South Carolina, the economic conditions of these areas could have a material
impact on the Company. See additional discussion below in the section entitled “Territory Served and Competition.”

Beginning in 1999, First Bank Insurance began
offering non-FDIC insured investment and insurance products, including mutual funds, annuities, long-term care insurance, life
insurance, and company retirement plans, as well as financial planning services (the “investments division”). In May
2001, First Bank Insurance added to its product line when it acquired two insurance agencies that specialized in the placement
of property and casualty insurance. In October 2003, the “investments division” of First Bank Insurance became a part
of the Bank. The primary activity of First Bank Insurance is now the placement of property and casualty insurance products. In
February 2010, First Bank Insurance acquired The Insurance Center, Inc., a Troy-based property and casualty insurance agency with
approximately 500 customers.
 
First Bancorp Capital Trust I was organized in
October 2002 for the purpose of issuing $20.6 million in debt securities. These debt securities were called by the Company at par
on November 7, 2007 and First Bancorp Capital Trust I was dissolved.
 
First Bancorp Capital Trust II and First Bancorp
Capital Trust III were organized in December 2003 for the purpose of issuing $20.6 million in debt securities ($10.3 million was
issued from each trust). These borrowings are due on January 23, 2034 and are also structured as trust preferred capital securities
in order to qualify as regulatory capital. These debt securities are callable by the Company at par on any quarterly interest payment
date beginning on January 23, 2009. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a weighted average
rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70%.
 
First Bancorp Capital Trust IV was organized
in April 2006 for the purpose of issuing $25.8 million in debt securities. These borrowings are due on June 15, 2036 and are also
structured as trust preferred capital securities that qualify as regulatory capital. These debt securities are callable by the
Company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on June 15, 2011. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts
on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.39%.

County, North Carolina. At the end of 2011, we served primarily the south central region (sometimes called the Piedmont region),
the central mountain region and the eastern coastal region of North Carolina, with additional operations in northeastern South
Carolina and southwestern Virginia. The following table presents, for each county where we operated as of December 31, 2011, the

Our branches and facilities are primarily located
in small communities whose economies are based primarily on services, manufacturing and light industry. Although our market is
predominantly small communities and rural areas, the market area is not dependent on agriculture. Textiles, furniture, mobile homes,
electronics, plastic and metal fabrication, forest products, food products, chicken hatcheries, and cigarettes are among the leading
manufacturing industries in the trade area. Leading producers of lumber and rugs are located in Montgomery County, North Carolina.
The Pinehurst area within Moore County, North Carolina, is a widely known golf resort and retirement area. The High Point, North
Carolina, area is widely known for its furniture market. New Hanover and Brunswick Counties, located in the southeastern coastal
region of North Carolina, are popular with tourists and have significant retirement populations. Buncombe County, located in the
western region of North Carolina, is a highly diverse area with industries in manufacturing, service, and tourism. Additionally,
several of the communities served by the Company are “bedroom” communities of large cities like Charlotte, Raleigh
and Greensboro, while several branches are located in medium-sized cities such as Albemarle, Asheboro, High Point, Southern Pines
and Sanford. We also have branches in small communities such as Bennett, Polkton, Vass, and Harmony.

Approximately 15% of our deposit base is in Moore
County. Accordingly, material changes in competition, the economy or population of Moore County could materially impact the Company.
No other county comprises more than 10% of our deposit base.
 
We compete in our various market areas with, among
others, several large interstate bank holding companies. These large competitors have substantially greater resources than us,
including broader geographic markets, higher lending limits and the ability to make greater use of large-scale advertising and
promotions. A significant number of interstate banking acquisitions have taken place in the past decade, thus further increasing
the size and financial resources of some of our competitors, three of which are among the largest bank holding companies in the
nation. In many of our markets, we also compete against banks that have been organized within the past ten to fifteen years. Until
recently, these new banks often focused on loan and deposit balance sheet growth, and not necessarily on earnings profitability,
which often resulted in them offering more attractive terms on loans and deposits than we were willing to offer in light of our
profitability goals. Due to capital considerations, most of these banks are no longer seeking balance sheet growth. This has increased
our ability to compete for loans, but the same banks continue to offer premium rates on deposits, presumably in an effort to maintain
maximum liquidity during these challenging economic times. Moore County, which as noted above comprises a disproportionate share
of our deposits, is a particularly competitive market, with at least eleven other financial institutions having a physical presence.
 
We compete not only against banking organizations,
but also against a wide range of financial service providers, including federally and state-chartered savings and loan institutions,
credit unions, investment and brokerage firms and small-loan or consumer finance companies. One of the credit unions in our market
area is among the largest in the nation. Competition among financial institutions of all types is virtually unlimited with respect
to legal ability and authority to provide most financial services. We also experience competition from internet banks, particularly
in the area of time deposits.
 
Despite the competitive market, we believe we
have certain advantages over our competition in the areas we serve. We seek to maintain a distinct local identity in each of the
communities we serve and we actively sponsor and participate in local civic affairs. Most lending and other customer-related business
decisions can be made without the delays often associated with larger institutions. Additionally, employment of local managers
and personnel in various offices and low turnover of personnel enable us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with
individual and corporate customers.
 
Lending Policy and Procedures
 
Conservative lending policies and procedures and
appropriate underwriting standards are high priorities of the Bank. Loans are approved under our written loan policy, which provides
that lending officers, principally branch managers, have authority to approve loans of various amounts up to $350,000, with lending
limits varying depending upon the experience of the lending officer and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Each of our regional
senior lending officers has discretion to approve secured loans of various principal amounts up to $500,000 and together can approve
loans up to $4,000,000. Loans above $4,000,000 must be approved by the Executive Committee of the Company’s board of directors.
    8
    Table of Contents
    
 
 
Our board of directors reviews and approves loans
that exceed management’s lending authority, loans to executive officers, directors, and their affiliates and, in certain
instances, other types of loans. New credit extensions are reviewed daily by our senior management and at least monthly by our
board of directors.
 
We continually monitor our loan portfolio to identify
areas of concern and to enable us to take corrective action. Lending officers and the board of directors meet periodically to review
past due loans and portfolio quality, while assuring that the Bank is appropriately meeting the credit needs of the communities
it serves. Individual lending officers are responsible for pursuing collection of past-due amounts and monitoring any changes in
the financial status of borrowers.
 
We also contract with an independent consulting
firm to review new loan originations meeting certain criteria, as well as to assign risk grades to existing credits meeting certain
thresholds. The consulting firm’s observations, comments, and risk grades, including variances with the Bank’s risk
grades, are shared with the audit committee of the Company’s board of directors and are considered by management in setting
Bank policy, as well as in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. The consulting firm also provides training
on a periodic basis to our lending officers to keep them updated on current developments in the marketplace. For additional information,
see “Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience” under Item 7 below.
 
Investment Policy and Procedures
 
We have adopted an investment policy designed
to maximize our income from funds not needed to meet loan demand, in a manner consistent with appropriate liquidity and risk objectives.
Pursuant to this policy, we may invest in federal, state and municipal obligations, federal agency obligations, public housing
authority bonds, industrial development revenue bonds, Federal Home Loan Bank bonds, Fannie Mae bonds, Government National Mortgage
Association bonds, Freddie Mac bonds, Small Business Administration bonds, and, to a limited extent, corporate bonds. Except for
corporate bonds, our investments must be rated at least Baa by Moody’s or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. Securities rated
below A are periodically reviewed for creditworthiness. We may purchase non-rated municipal bonds only if such bonds are in our
general market area and we determine these bonds have a credit risk no greater than the minimum ratings referred to above. Industrial
development authority bonds, which normally are not rated, are purchased only if they are judged to possess a high degree of credit
soundness to assure reasonably prompt sale at a fair value. We are also authorized by our board of directors to invest a portion
of our securities portfolio in high quality corporate bonds, with the amount of such bonds not to exceed 15% of the entire securities
portfolio. Prior to purchasing a corporate bond, the Company’s management performs due diligence on the issuer of the bond,
and the purchase is not made unless we believe that the purchase of the bond bears no more risk to the Company than would an unsecured
loan to the same company.
 
Our investment officer implements the investment
policy, monitors the investment portfolio, recommends portfolio strategies and reports to the Company’s Investment Committee.
The Investment Committee generally meets on a quarterly basis to review investment activity and to assess the overall position
of the securities portfolio. The Investment Committee compares our securities portfolio with portfolios of other companies of comparable
size. In addition, reports of all purchases, sales, issuer calls, net profits or losses and market appreciation or depreciation
of the securities portfolio are reviewed by our board of directors each month. Once a quarter, our interest rate risk exposure
is evaluated by our board of directors. Each year, the written investment policy is approved by the board of directors.

Mergers and Acquisitions
 
As part of our operations, we have pursued an
acquisition strategy over the years to augment our internal growth. We regularly evaluate the potential acquisition of, or merger
with, various financial institutions. Our acquisitions have generally fallen into one of three categories - 1) an acquisition of
a financial institution or branch thereof within a market in which we operate, 2) an acquisition of a financial institution or
branch thereof in a market contiguous or nearly contiguous to a market in which we operate, or 3) an acquisition of a company that
has products or services that we do not currently offer. Historically, we have paid for our acquisitions with cash and/or common
stock and any operating income or loss has been fully borne by the Company beginning on the closing date of the acquisition.
 
In 2009, FDIC-assisted acquisitions began to occur
frequently as banking regulators closed problem banks. In FDIC-assisted transactions, the acquiring bank often does not pay any
consideration for the failed bank, and in some cases receives cash from the FDIC as part of the transaction. In addition, the acquiring
bank usually enters into one or more loss share agreements with the FDIC, which affords the acquiring bank significant loss protection.
As discussed below, we completed FDIC-assisted transactions in 2009 and 2011.
 
We believe that we can enhance our earnings by
pursuing these types of acquisition opportunities through any combination or all of the following: 1) achieving cost efficiencies,
2) enhancing the acquiree’s earnings or gaining new customers by introducing a more successful banking model with more products
and services to the acquiree’s market base, 3) increasing customer satisfaction or gaining new customers by providing more
locations for the convenience of customers, and 4) leveraging the customer base by offering new products and services. There is
also the possibility, especially in a FDIC-assisted transaction, to record a gain on the acquisition date arising from the difference
between the purchase price and the acquisition date fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities.
 
Since 2000, we have completed acquisitions in
each of the three categories described above. We have completed several whole-bank traditional acquisitions in our existing and
contiguous markets; we have purchased numerous bank branches from other banks (both in existing market area and in contiguous/nearly
contiguous markets) and we have acquired several insurance agencies, which provided us with the ability to offer property and casualty
insurance coverage.
 
In addition to the traditional acquisitions discussed
above, in both 2009 and 2011 we acquired the operations of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. On June 19, 2009, we acquired
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank in a FDIC-assisted transaction. Cooperative Bank operated through
twenty-one branches in North Carolina and three branches in South Carolina in the same markets in which the Bank was already operating,
as well as in several new, mostly contiguous markets. In connection with the acquisition, the Bank assumed assets with a book value
of $959 million, including $829 million in loans and $706 million in deposits. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
for more information on this acquisition.
 
On January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC-assisted transaction. The Bank of Asheville operated through
five branches in or near Asheville, North Carolina. This market was a new market for the Bank. In connection with the acquisition,
the Bank assumed assets with a book value of $190 million, including $154 million in loans and $192 million in deposits. See Note
2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this acquisition.
 
On October 21, 2011, we entered into a Branch
Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank, in Whiteville, North Carolina, which provides for the Bank to acquire eleven
branches from Waccamaw Bank. Deposits for these branches total approximately $180 million and loans total approximately $98 million.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on this pending acquisition, which is currently awaiting
regulatory approval.

    Table of Contents
    
 
There are many factors that we consider when evaluating
how much to offer for potential acquisition candidates (including FDIC-assisted transactions) with a few of the more significant
factors being projected impact on earnings per share, projected impact on capital, and projected impact on book value and tangible
book value. Significant assumptions that affect this analysis include the estimated future earnings stream of the acquisition candidate,
estimated credit and other losses to be incurred, the amount of cost efficiencies that can be realized, and the interest rate earned/lost
on the cash received/paid. In addition to these primary factors, we also consider other factors including (but not limited to)
marketplace acquisition statistics, location of the candidate in relation to our expansion strategy, market growth potential, management
of the candidate, potential integration issues (including corporate culture), and the size of the acquisition candidate.
 
We plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities
that could potentially benefit the Company and its shareholders. These opportunities may include acquisitions that do not fit the
categories discussed above.
 
For a further discussion of recent acquisition
activity, see “Merger and Acquisition Activity” under Item 7 below.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2011, we had 811 full-time
and 38 part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our employee relations
to be good.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
As a bank holding company, we are subject to supervision,
examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and
the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks (the “Commissioner”). The Bank is subject to supervision and
examination by the FDIC and the Commissioner. For additional information, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
 
Supervision and Regulation of the Company
 
The Company is a bank holding company within the
meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Company is also regulated by the Commissioner under the North
Carolina Bank Holding Company Act of 1984.
 
A bank holding company is required to file quarterly
reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries with the Federal Reserve Board. It
is also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and is required to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to making
certain acquisitions of other institutions or voting securities. The Federal Reserve Board requires the Company to maintain certain
levels of capital - see “Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity.” The Federal Reserve Board also has the
authority to take enforcement action against any bank holding company that commits any unsafe or unsound practice, or violates
certain laws, regulations or conditions imposed in writing by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board generally prohibits
a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend that would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks
or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements which might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial
position. Under the Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is not permitted to continue its existing rate of cash
dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings
retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
    11
    Table of Contents
    
 
The Commissioner is empowered to regulate certain
acquisitions of North Carolina banks and bank holding companies, issue cease and desist orders for violations of North Carolina
banking laws, and promulgate rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of the North Carolina Bank Holding Company Act of 1984.
 
Regulatory authorities have cease and desist powers
over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries where their actions would constitute a serious threat to the safety,
soundness or stability of a subsidiary bank. Those authorities may compel holding companies to invest additional capital into banking
subsidiaries upon acquisitions or in the event of significant loan losses or rapid growth of loans or deposits.
 
The United States Congress and the North Carolina
General Assembly have periodically considered and adopted legislation that has impacted the Company.
 
Supervision and Regulation of the Bank
 
Federal banking regulations applicable to all
depository financial institutions, among other things: (i) provide federal bank regulatory agencies with powers to prevent unsafe
and unsound banking practices; (ii) restrict preferential loans by banks to “insiders” of banks; (iii) require banks
to keep information on loans to major shareholders and executive officers and (iv) bar certain director and officer interlocks
between financial institutions.
 
As a state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject
to the provisions of the North Carolina banking statutes and to regulation by the Commissioner. The Commissioner has a wide range
of regulatory authority over the activities and operations of the Bank, and the Commissioner’s staff conducts periodic examinations
of the Bank and its affiliates to ensure compliance with state banking regulations and to assess the safety and soundness of the
Bank. Among other things, the Commissioner regulates the merger and consolidation of state-chartered banks, the payment of dividends,
loans to officers and directors, recordkeeping, types and amounts of loans and investments, and the establishment of branches.
The Commissioner also has cease and desist powers over state-chartered banks for violations of state banking laws or regulations
and for unsafe or unsound conduct that is likely to jeopardize the interest of depositors.
 
The dividends that may be paid by the Bank to
the Company are subject to legal limitations under North Carolina law. In addition, regulatory authorities may restrict dividends
that may be paid by the Bank or the Company’s other subsidiaries. The ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders
is largely dependent on the dividends paid to the Company by the Bank.
 
The FDIC is authorized to approve conversions,
mergers, consolidations and assumptions of deposit liability transactions between insured banks and uninsured banks or institutions,
and to prevent capital or surplus diminution in such transactions if the resulting, continuing, or assumed bank is an insured nonmember
bank. In addition, the FDIC monitors the Bank’s compliance with several banking statutes, such as the Depository Institution
Management Interlocks Act and the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The FDIC also conducts periodic examinations of the Bank
to assess its safety and soundness and its compliance with banking laws and regulations, and it has the power to implement changes
to, or restrictions on, the Bank’s operations if it finds that a violation is occurring or is threatened.
 
U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program (TARP)
 
On October 3, 2008, in response to the financial
crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions,
the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury
was given the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain
other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial
markets.
    12
    Table of Contents
    
 
On October 14, 2008, the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of the Treasury announced that the Treasury would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts. Under
the program, known as the Capital Purchase Program (also known as “TARP”), the Treasury made $250 billion of capital
available from EESA to U.S. financial institutions in the form of purchases of preferred stock. In addition to the preferred stock,
the Treasury received, from participating financial institutions, warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price
equal to 15% of the preferred investment. Participating financial institutions were required to adopt the Treasury’s standards
for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the Treasury holds equity issued under the Capital
Purchase Program.
 
Although we believed that our capital position
was sound, we concluded that the Capital Purchase Program would allow us to raise additional capital on favorable terms in comparison
with other available alternatives. Accordingly, we applied to participate in the Capital Purchase Program. The Treasury approved
our application in December 2008, and we received $65 million in proceeds from the sale of 65,000 shares of Series A cumulative
perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share to the Treasury on January 9, 2009. The terms of the preferred
stock issued to the Treasury require a dividend of 5% for the first five years and 9% thereafter. As part of the transaction, we
also granted the Treasury a ten-year warrant to purchase up to 616,308 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $15.82
per share.
 
On September 1, 2011, we redeemed the 65,000 shares
of outstanding Series A preferred stock from the Treasury for a redemption price of $65 million, plus unpaid dividends. We funded
the majority of this transaction by simultaneously issuing Series B preferred stock to the Treasury in connection with our participation
in the Small Business Lending Fund (see below). In November 2011, we repurchased the outstanding common stock warrant from the
Treasury at a price of $1.50 per common share for a total of $924,000. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for
more information on these transactions.
 
Small Business Lending Fund
 
In December 2010, the U.S. Treasury announced
the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) program, which was established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.
The SBLF was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks at favorable rates.
 
Interested financial institutions were required
to submit an application and a small business lending plan. Less than half of the financial institutions that applied for the SBLF
were approved. We were one of the institutions approved, and on September 1, 2011, we completed the sale of $63.5 million of Series
B preferred stock to the Treasury under the SBLF. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received 63,500
shares of Series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $63.5
million. As noted above, we used the $63.5 million received from this issuance along with $1.5 million of existing Company funds
to redeem the $65 million of preferred stock issued to the Treasury as part of the Capital Purchase Program. The initial dividend
rate on SBLF preferred stock was 5%. Depending on our success in meeting certain loan growth targets to small businesses, the dividend
rate could decrease to as low as 1% for a period of time. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

FDIC Insurance
 
As a member of the FDIC, the Bank’s deposits
are insured by the FDIC. For this protection, each member bank pays a quarterly statutory assessment (which was previously based
on deposits, but is now based on average total assets less average tangible equity) and is subject to the rules and regulations
of the FDIC. In 2009, the FDIC assessed minimum rates ranging from twelve cents to sixteen cents per $100 in deposits. During 2009,
we recorded approximately $3.9 million in annual FDIC insurance premium expense (excluding the special assessment discussed below).
 
The FDIC announced on February 27, 2009 an interim
rule that imposed a one-time special assessment of seven cents per $100 in insured deposits to be collected on September 30, 2009,
which resulted in a $1.6 million expense for the Bank that was recorded in the second quarter of 2009 and paid on September 30,
2009. The interim rule also permits the FDIC to impose emergency special assessments from time to time after June 30, 2009 if the
FDIC board believes the deposit insurance fund will fall to a level that would adversely affect public confidence in federal deposit
insurance. To date, the FDIC has not imposed additional special assessments, but in December 2009, the FDIC did require banks to
prepay their estimated insurance premiums for 2010 through 2012, which resulted in the Bank prepaying approximately $16.9 million
in premiums. This prepaid amount is being recorded as expense on our books as it is incurred. We recognized approximately $4.4
million in FDIC insurance expense in 2010.
 
In February 2011, the FDIC announced changes to
the deposit insurance program whereby FDIC deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets less average tangible
equity instead of the previous methodology that was based on deposits. Also, new assessment rates were adopted. The new assessment
methodology and assessment rates became effective April 1, 2011. These changes were favorable to our insurance rates, and we recognized
approximately $3.0 million in FDIC insurance expense in 2011 compared to the previously noted insurance expense of $4.4 million
and $3.9 million (excluding the special assessment) in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
 
Legislative and Regulatory Developments
 
Given the ongoing financial crisis and the current
presidential administration, legislation that would affect regulation in the banking industry is introduced in most legislative
sessions. The most significant recent legislative and regulatory developments impacting the Company were 1) the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and 2) Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation, each of which is discussed
below.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010
 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law.
The Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory
and compliance changes including, among other things,
 
     
    •
    enhanced authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies;
     
    •
    increased capital and liquidity requirements;
     
    •
    increased regulatory examination fees;
     
    •
    specific provisions designed to improve supervision and safety and soundness by imposing restrictions and limitations on the scope and type of banking and financial activities.
 
    14
    Table of Contents
    
 
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a
new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system that will be enforced by new and existing federal regulatory
agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), the Office of Comptroller
of the Currency, the FDIC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The following description briefly summarizes aspects
of the Dodd-Frank Act that could impact the Company, both currently and prospectively.
 
Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act made
permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits, which was an increase from the previous limit of $100,000.
The Act also provides for unlimited deposit insurance coverage on non-interest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository
institutions effective December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revised
the assessment base against which an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC’s
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) will be calculated. Under the amendments, which became effective on April 1, 2011, the FDIC assessment
base is no longer the institution’s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible
equity. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35%
of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions
when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds by September 30, 2020.
 
Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank
Act provided that beginning July 21, 2011 depository institutions were permitted to pay interest on business demand deposits with
no limit on the number of monthly withdrawals. Prior to July 21, 2011, we entered into securities repurchase agreements with business
customers in order to allow them to earn interest on their excess funds. With the prohibition of paying interest now removed, we
have been able to pay interest on our customers’ deposits without the need to enter into a securities repurchase agreement.
During 2011, approximately $38 million in liabilities previously classified as “securities sold under agreements to repurchase”
were moved to the “NOW” deposit account category. At this time, we do not expect a material increase in total interest
expense, only an insignificant amount of reclassification among interest expense categories, as a result of these changes.
 
Trust Preferred Securities. The Dodd-Frank
Act prohibits bank holding companies from including in their regulatory Tier 1 capital hybrid debt and equity securities issued
on or after May 19, 2010. Among the hybrid debt and equity securities included in this prohibition are trust preferred securities,
which we have issued in the past in order to raise additional Tier 1 capital and otherwise improve our regulatory capital ratios.
Although we may continue to include our existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, the prohibition on the use of these
securities as Tier 1 capital may limit our ability to raise capital in the future.
 
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new, independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) within the FRB. The CFPB’s responsibility
is to establish, implement and enforce rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the
conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes
that govern products and services banks offer to consumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection
laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations the CFPB will promulgate and state attorney generals will have
the authority to enforce consumer protection rules the CFPB adopts against state-chartered institutions and national banks. Compliance
with any such new regulations established by the CFPB and/or states could reduce our revenue, increase our cost of operations,
and limit our ability to expand into certain products and services.
 
Debit Card Interchange Fees. The
Dodd-Frank Act gives the FRB the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit
transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees
be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. While we are not directly subject to these
rules for so long as our assets do not exceed $10 billion, our activities as a debit card issuer may nevertheless be
indirectly impacted by the change in the applicable debit card market caused by these regulations, which may require us
to match any new lower fee structure implemented by larger financial institutions in order to remain competitive in the
future. The new caps on interchange fees for banks with assets greater than $10 billion became effective October 1, 2011. To
date, the Company has not noted any significant indirect negative effects of the interchange fee caps that are applicable to
the larger financial institutions.
    15
    Table of Contents
    
 
Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for
banks and bank holding companies. These new standards will be no less strict than existing regulatory capital and leverage standards
applicable to insured depository institutions and may, in fact, become higher once the agencies promulgate the new standards. Compliance
with heightened capital standards may reduce our ability to generate or originate revenue-producing assets and thereby restrict
revenue generation from banking and non-banking operations.
 
Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank
Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including
an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions,” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral
requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 
Transactions with Insiders. The Dodd-Frank
Act expands insider transaction limitations through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the
types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase
agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also places restrictions on certain asset sales
to and from an insider of an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances,
receive the approval of the institution’s board of directors.
 
Enhanced Lending Limits. The Dodd-Frank
Act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to one borrower. Federal banking law currently
limits a national bank’s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons to an amount that does not exceed
certain thresholds. The Dodd-Frank Act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative
transactions, repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. It also will eventually prohibit state-chartered
banks from engaging in derivative transactions unless the state lending limit laws take into account credit exposure to such transactions.
 
Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act
addresses many corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies, including
the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act:
 
     
    •
    grants shareholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation;
     
    •
    enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members;
     
    •
    requires companies listed on national securities exchanges to adopt clawback policies for incentive-based compensation plans applicable to executive officers; and
     
    •
    provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow shareholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as directors and require such companies to include such nominees in its proxy materials.
 
Many of the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act
will be subject to implementation over the course of several years. While we do not currently expect the final requirements of
the Dodd-Frank Act to have a material adverse impact on the Company, we do expect them to negatively impact our profitability,
require changes to certain of our business practices, including limitations on fee income opportunities, and impose more stringent
capital, liquidity and leverage requirements upon the Company. These changes may also require us to invest significant management
attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements.

Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation
 
In recent years, the Federal Reserve and FDIC
have enacted consumer protection regulations related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions.
In November 2009, the Federal Reserve amended its Regulation E to prohibit financial institutions, including the Company, from
charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer
consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. The Regulation E amendments also require financial
institutions to provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the
fees associated with the service and the consumer’s choices. We have completed implementation of the changes as required
by the Regulation E amendments, which resulted in reductions to overdraft fees that we were able to collect beginning in the second
half of 2010.
 
In November 2010, the FDIC supplemented the Regulation
E amendments by requiring FDIC-supervised institutions, including the Bank, to implement additional changes relating to automated
overdraft payment programs by July 1, 2011. The most significant of these changes require financial institutions to monitor overdraft
payment programs for “excessive or chronic” customer use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-up
action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. The additional guidance
also imposes daily limits on overdraft charges, requires institutions to review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently
distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and requires increased board and management oversight regarding
overdraft payment programs. We have now implemented the supplemental requirements of the Regulation E amendments, which resulted
in further reductions to the amount of overdraft fees we were able to collect beginning in July 2011.
 
Neither the Company nor the Bank can predict what
other legislation might be enacted or what other regulations or assessments might be adopted.
 
See “Capital Resources and Shareholders’
Equity” under Item 7 below for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
 
An investment in our common stock involves certain
risks. Before you invest in our common stock, you should be aware that there are various risks, including those described below,
which could affect the value of your investment in the future. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of
these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described in this section, as well as any cautionary
language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
including our operating results and financial condition. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks
and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially or adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to
any of these identified or other unidentified risks.
 
Difficult market conditions and economic trends
have adversely affected our industry and our business.
 
A general economic downturn began in the latter
half of 2007. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures,
have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans, especially land development loans, and resulted in significant
write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. In addition, the value of real estate collateral supporting many loans has
declined and may continue to decline. General downward economic trends, reduced availability of commercial credit and high unemployment
rates have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit, resulting in additional write-downs. While
there have been recent signs of recovery in the national economy, the economic conditions in our market area do not seem to have
improved. We believe that the economic downtrends are largely responsible for the deterioration in loan quality that we experienced
over the past three years, including higher levels of loan charge-offs, higher levels of nonperforming assets, and higher provisions
for loan losses. Concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial
institutions to their customers and to each other. This market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial
and consumer delinquencies, lack of confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity.
Financial institutions, including us, have experienced a decrease in access to borrowings. The resulting economic pressure on consumers
and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect,
our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.
 
As a result of the foregoing factors, there is
a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and
bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. This
increased governmental action may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.
 
Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of
customers and to estimate the losses inherent in our credit exposure is made more complex by these difficult market and economic
conditions. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market and economic
conditions on us, our customers and the other financial institutions in our market. As a result, we may experience additional increases
in foreclosures, delinquencies and customer bankruptcies, as well as more restricted access to funds.
 
We are vulnerable to the economic conditions
within the fairly small geographic region in which we operate.
 
Like many businesses, our overall success is partially
dependent on the economic conditions in the marketplace where we operate. Our marketplace is predominately concentrated in the
central Piedmont and coastal regions of North Carolina. These regions continue to experience recessionary economic conditions,
which we believe is a factor in our increases in borrower delinquencies, nonperforming assets, and loan losses during 2009, 2010,
and 2011 compared to recent prior years. If economic conditions in our marketplace worsen, it would likely have an adverse impact
on us. In particular, if economic conditions related to real estate values in our marketplace were to worsen, our loan losses would
likely increase. At December 31, 2011, approximately 90% of our loans were secured by real estate collateral, which means that
additional decreases in real estate values would have an adverse impact on our operations.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be
required to record a significant charge to earnings.
 
We have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet
as an asset with a carrying value as of December 31, 2011 of $65.8 million. Under generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill
is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The test for goodwill impairment
involves comparing the fair value of a company’s reporting units to their respective carrying values. For our company, our
community banking operation is our only material reporting unit. The price of our common stock is one of several measures available
for estimating the fair value of our community banking operations. For much of 2009, 2010 and 2011, the stock market value of our
common stock traded below the book value of our company. Subject to the results of other valuation techniques, if this situation
persists or worsens, this could indicate that our next test of goodwill will result in a determination that there is impairment.
We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment
of our goodwill is determined, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.
 
We may be subject to more stringent capital
requirements.
 
We are subject to capital adequacy guidelines
and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which we must maintain. From time to time, the
regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines
and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In light of proposed changes
to regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions
formulated by the Basel Committee and implemented by the Federal Reserve, we likely will be required to satisfy additional, more
stringent, capital adequacy standards. The ultimate impact of the new capital standards on us cannot be determined at this time
and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by U.S. banking regulators. These requirements,
however, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business
levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 
We might be required to raise additional capital
in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us when it is needed.
 
We are required to maintain adequate capital levels
to support our operations. In the future, we might need to raise additional capital to support growth, absorb loan losses, or meet
more stringent capital requirements. Our access to capital markets has remained limited for most of the past three years (excluding
the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program and the Small Business Lending Fund). Our ability to raise additional capital will
depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly,
we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital in the future if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot
raise additional capital when needed, our ability to conduct our business could be materially impaired.

The soundness of other financial institutions
could adversely affect us.
 
Since the middle of 2007, the financial services
industry as a whole, as well as the securities markets generally, have been materially adversely affected by substantial declines
in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a significant lack of liquidity. Financial institutions, especially in North Carolina
and the rest of the Southeast, have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence. Our ability
to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial
institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.
We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in
the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. Defaults by, or even rumors
or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide
liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We can make no assurance that any such
losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
We are subject to extensive regulation, which
could have an adverse effect on our operations.
 
We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision
from the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve Board. This regulation and supervision is intended
primarily for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers, rather than for holders of our equity
securities. In the past, our business has been materially affected by these regulations. This trend is likely to continue in the
future.
 
Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion
in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of
our assets and the determination of the level of allowance for loan losses. Changes in the regulations that apply to us, or changes
in our compliance with regulations, could have a material impact on our operations.
 
Financial reform legislation enacted by the
U.S. Congress, and further changes in regulation to which we are exposed, will result in additional new laws and regulations that
are expected to increase our costs of operations.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to significantly
change bank regulatory structure and affect lending, deposit, investment, and operating activities of financial institutions and
their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations,
and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and
implementing the rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may
not be known for many months or years. See “Legislative and Regulatory Developments – Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010” above for additional information regarding the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and gave it broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks
and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Additionally,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with
more than $10 billion in assets.
 
Proposals for further regulation of the financial
services industry are continually being introduced in the Congress of the United States of America. The agencies regulating the
financial services industry also periodically adopt changes to their regulations. It is possible that additional legislative proposals
may be adopted or regulatory changes may be made that would have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, it is expected
that such regulatory changes will increase our operating and compliance cost. We can provide no assurance regarding the manner
in which new laws and regulations will affect us.
    20
    Table of Contents
    
 
We are subject to interest rate risk, which
could negatively impact earnings.
 
Net interest income is the most significant component
of our earnings. Our net interest income results from the difference between the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets,
primarily loans and investments, and the rates that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings.
When interest rates change, the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities
do not necessarily move in tandem with each other because of the difference between their maturities and repricing characteristics.
This mismatch can negatively impact net interest income if the margin between yields earned and rates paid narrows. Interest rate
environment changes can occur at any time and are affected by many factors that are outside our control, including inflation, recession,
unemployment trends, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic
and foreign financial markets.
 
Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate
to cover actual losses.
 
Like all financial institutions, we maintain an
allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses caused by customer loan defaults. The allowance for loan losses may not
be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and in this case additional and larger provisions for loan losses would be required to
replenish the allowance. Provisions for loan losses are a direct charge against income.
 
We establish the amount of the allowance for loan
losses based on historical loss rates, as well as estimates and assumptions about future events. Because of the extensive use of
estimates and assumptions, our actual loan losses could differ, possibly significantly, from our estimate. We believe that our
allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses, but it is possible that the allowance for loan losses will
need to be increased for credit reasons or that regulators will require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences
could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.
 
In the normal course of business, we process
large volumes of transactions involving millions of dollars. If our internal controls fail to work as expected, if our systems
are used in an unauthorized manner, or if our employees subvert our internal controls, we could experience significant losses.
 
We process large volumes of transactions on a
daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk includes the risk of fraud by persons inside
or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
systems and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk also includes potential legal actions
that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.
 
We establish and maintain systems of internal
operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. Although not foolproof,
these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed
to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational
risk may occur, including the effects of operational errors. In 2011, we experienced a fraud loss of $1 million involving the circumvention
of internal controls by an employee. We continually monitor and improve our internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide
processes and procedures, but there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.

Negative public opinion regarding our company
and the financial services industry in general, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.
 
Reputation risk, or the risk to our business,
earnings and capital from negative public opinion regarding our company and the financial services industry in general, is inherent
in our business. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending
practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in
response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees
and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we have taken steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with
our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.
 
Our reported financial results are impacted
by management’s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.
 
Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental
to the way we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting
and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect
management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management
must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances,
yet may result in reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.
 
Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting
our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that
are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates.
These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for loan losses; the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets;
and the accounting for FDIC loss share transactions.
 
There can be no assurance that we will continue
to pay cash dividends .
 
Although we have historically paid cash dividends,
there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends. Future payment of cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion
of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, economic
conditions, and such other factors as the board may deem relevant.
 
Our business continuity plans or data security
systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, our business and a negative impact
on our results of operations.
 
We rely heavily on communications and information
systems to conduct our business. Our daily operations depend on the operational effectiveness of our technology. We rely on our
systems to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our computer
systems or outside technology, due to severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, criminal activity or other factors,
could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger, deposit, loan, customer relationship management, and other systems leading
to inaccurate financial records. This could materially affect our business operations and financial condition. While we have disaster
recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption or security breach
of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur
or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches
of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory
scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.

In addition, the Bank provides its customers the
ability to bank online. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking.
While we use qualified third party vendors to test and audit our network, our network could become vulnerable to unauthorized access,
computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security issues. The Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources
to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or computer viruses. To the extent that the Bank activities or the activities
of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the
Bank to claims, litigation, and other potential liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could
also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank’s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and its
ability to generate deposits.
 
Our potential inability to integrate companies
we may acquire in the future could expose us to financial, execution, and operational risks that could negatively affect our financial
condition and results of operations. Acquisitions may be dilutive to common shareholders and FDIC-assisted transactions have additional
compliance risk that other acquisitions do not have.
 
On occasion, we may engage in a strategic acquisition
when we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand our business. In addition, such acquisitions may involve the issuance
of stock, which may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, we must integrate
the administrative, financial, sales, lending, collections, and marketing functions of the acquired company. If we are unable to
successfully integrate an acquired company, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition, and our financial results may be
negatively affected. A completed acquisition may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including
our capital requirements and the accounting treatment of the acquisition. Completed acquisitions may also lead to exposure from
potential asset quality issues, losses of key employees or customers, difficulty and expense of integrating operations and systems,
and significant unexpected liabilities after the consummation of these acquisitions. In addition, if we were to conclude that the
value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in a
goodwill impairment charge, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
 
We may have opportunities to acquire the assets
and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC-assisted transactions. Although these transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance
to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks, such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain
liabilities of the failed institution, we are (and would be in future transactions) subject to many of the same risks we would
face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction, including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships
and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames we expect. In addition, ongoing
compliance risk under the loss-share agreement with the FDIC is considerable and the event of noncompliance could result in coverage
under the loss-share being disallowed, thus increasing the actual losses to the Bank. Our inability to overcome these risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 2. Properties
 
The main offices of the Company and the Bank are
owned by the Bank and are located in a three-story building in the central business district of Troy, North Carolina. The building
houses administrative and bank teller facilities. The Bank’s Operations Division, including customer accounting functions,
offices for information technology operations, and offices for loan operations, are housed in two one-story steel frame buildings
approximately one-half mile west of the main office. Both of these buildings are owned by the Bank. The Company operates 97 bank
branches. The Company owns all of its bank branch premises except eight branch offices for which the land and buildings are leased
and ten branch offices for which the land is leased but the building is owned. The Company also leases one loan production office.
There are no options to purchase or lease additional properties. The Company considers its facilities adequate to meet current
needs and believes that lease renewals or replacement properties can be acquired as necessary to meet future needs.
 
Item 3. Legal Proceedings
 
Various legal proceedings may arise in the ordinary
course of business and may be pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries. However, neither the Company nor
any of its subsidiaries is involved in any pending legal proceedings that management believes could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial position of the Company. If an exposure were to be identified, it is the Company’s policy to establish
and accrue appropriate reserves during the accounting period in which a loss is deemed to be probable and the amount is determinable.
 
There were no tax shelter penalties assessed by

Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common
Stock, Related Shareholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
 
Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select
Market under the symbol FBNC. Table 22, included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” below, sets forth
the high and low market prices of our common stock as traded by the brokerage firms that maintain a market in our common stock
and the dividends declared for the periods indicated. We paid a cash dividend of $0.08 per share for each quarter of 2011. For
the foreseeable future, it is our current intention to continue to pay cash dividends of $0.08 per share on a quarterly basis.
See “Business - Supervision and Regulation” above and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion
of other regulatory restrictions on the Company’s payment of dividends. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately
2,600 shareholders of record and another 3,500 shareholders whose stock is held in “street name.” There were no sales
of unregistered securities during the year ended December 31, 2011.

Additional Information Regarding the Registrant’s
Equity Compensation Plans
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four equity-based
compensation plans, one of which was assumed in a corporate acquisition. The Company’s 2007 Equity Plan is the only one of
the four plans under which new grants of equity-based awards are possible.
 
The following table presents information as of
December 31, 2011 regarding shares of the Company’s stock that may be issued pursuant to the Company’s equity based
compensation plans. The table does not include information with respect to shares subject to outstanding options granted under
a stock incentive plan assumed by the Company in connection with the acquisition of the company that originally granted those options.
Footnote (2) to the table indicates the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options under the
assumed plan as of December 31, 2011, and the weighted average exercise price of those options. No additional options may be granted

The following is a more detailed discussion of
our results for 2011 compared to 2010:
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, we reported
net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million compared to $5.9 million reported for 2010. Earnings per diluted common
share were $0.44 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0.35 for 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, we realized a $10.2
million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank, which is recorded in noninterest income. The after-tax
impact of this gain on net income was $6.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share.
 
In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded $2.3
million of accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on the preferred stock that was redeemed during the quarter. This stock
was originally issued to the U.S. Treasury in January 2009 as part of the program known as TARP. When this preferred stock was
redeemed, the remaining discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the stock, which had been on a five year accretion schedule,
was immediately accreted as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Total discount accretion of the preferred
stock for 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share.
    28
    Table of Contents
    
  
In both 2011 and 2010, we experienced significant
write-downs and losses associated with loans and foreclosed properties that were assumed in two failed bank acquisitions. The amounts
of the write-downs and losses were less in 2011 than in 2010, but continued to significantly impact our earnings.
 
We note that our results of operation are significantly
affected by the on-going accounting for the two FDIC-assisted failed bank acquisitions that we have completed. In the discussion
below, the term “covered” is used to describe assets included as part of FDIC loss share agreements, which generally
result in the FDIC reimbursing the Company for 80% of losses incurred.
 
For covered loans that deteriorate in terms of
repayment expectations, we record immediate allowances through the provision of loan losses. For covered loans that experience
favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date, including loans that payoff, we record
positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan – also referred to as loan discount accretion.
For foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values, we record gains/losses within
noninterest income.
 
The adjustments discussed above are recorded within
the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered
assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the
FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations. The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset
is reflected within noninterest income.
 
The adjustments noted above can result in volatility
within individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset,
pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans, discount accretion, and losses from
covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification
asset.
 
Total assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to
$3.3 billion, a 0.4% increase from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2011 amounted to $2.4 billion, a 1.0% decrease from
a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011, a 3.9% increase from a year earlier.
 
Since the onset of the recession, we have generally
experienced declines in loans and deposits. Normal loan paydowns, loan charge-offs, and loan foreclosures have exceeded new loan
growth, which has provided the liquidity to lessen our reliance on high cost deposits. However, for the last half of 2011, we experienced
modest growth in our non-covered loan portfolio, which increased $28 million from June 30, 2011 through year end. We are actively
pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve our asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our
preferred stock, as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Brokered deposits remained at a low level at
December 31, 2011, comprising just 5.7% of total deposits, with internet deposits comprising an additional 1.1%.
 
Net interest income for the year ended December
31, 2011 amounted to $132.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 3.8%, from 2010. The higher net interest income was primarily
caused by an increase in 2011 in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions. Loan discount
accretion amounted to $11.6 million for 2011 compared to $7.6 million in 2010, an increase of $4 million. As previously discussed,
the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only 20% of the gross amount of the change. See “Net Interest
Income” below for additional information.
    29
    Table of Contents
    
  
Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest
income divided by average earnings assets) for 2011 was 4.72% compared to 4.39% for 2010. The higher margin was primarily due to
the aforementioned increase in loan discount accretion, as well as a decline in funding costs.
 
Our provisions for loan losses remain elevated
compared to historical levels, primarily due to continued high unemployment rates and ongoing declines in property values in our
market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. Our provision for loan losses for non-covered loans
amounted to $28.5 million for 2011 compared to $33.6 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was primarily due to
stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans.
 
We recorded $12.8 million in provision for loan
losses on covered loans during 2011 compared to $20.9 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was due to declines
in covered nonperforming loans resulting from the resolution of a significant amount of these loans through a combination of charge-offs
and foreclosures.
 
Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December
31, 2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered
nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010.
 
Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31,
2011 amounted to $141 million compared to $168 million at December 31, 2010.
 
Noninterest income for the year ended December
31, 2011 amounted to $26.2 million compared to $29.1 million for 2010. The decline in noninterest income in 2011 is primarily due
to lower amounts of indemnification asset income recorded. As previously discussed, when we anticipate receiving additional amounts
from the FDIC because of new losses identified in our covered loan and foreclosed property portfolios, we record indemnification
asset income for 80% of the expected loss. In 2011, fewer new losses were identified compared to 2010, and thus less indemnification
asset income was recorded.
 
Noninterest expenses for the year ended December
31, 2011 amounted to $96.1 million, a 10.5% increase from the $87.0 million recorded in 2010. The majority of the increase relates
to personnel expense, which increased partially due to employees joining the Company in the 2011 Bank of Asheville acquisition.
We also experienced higher employee medical expense due to higher claims in 2011 compared to 2010. We have also progressively built
our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities and the overall growth of the Company, and to
prepare for future growth, which has generally resulted in higher expenses across all categories.
 
Our effective tax rates were 35.1% and 33.2% for
the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Overview – 2010 Compared to 2009
 
Net income was significantly lower in 2010 than
in 2009 primarily due to a gain that resulted from the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June 2009. Most items of income and expense
were higher in 2010 than in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, which impacted the Company for twelve months in 2010
compared to six months in 2009 beginning with the June acquisition date. In 2010, our provision for loan losses increased significantly
due to deterioration of asset quality, which we believe was primarily caused by the recessionary economic environment, including
its unfavorable effect on real estate values.

The following is a more detailed discussion of
our results for 2010 compared to 2009:
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported
net income available to common shareholders of $5.9 million compared to $56.3 million reported for 2009. Earnings per diluted common
share were $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3.37 for 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, we realized a
$67.9 million gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank. The after-tax impact of this gain was $41.1 million, or $2.46 per
diluted common share.
 
Earnings reported for 2010 were impacted by write-downs
of foreclosed properties that were assumed in our 2009 failed bank acquisition and also by higher provisions for loan losses related
both to loans acquired in the failed bank acquisition and to our legacy loans (loans not obtained in the failed bank acquisition).
 
Total assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to
$3.3 billion, a 7.5% decrease from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2010 amounted to $2.5 billion, a 7.5% decrease from
a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a 9.6% decrease from a year earlier. The contraction
of our balance sheet was primarily a result of weak loan demand during 2010, which allowed us to lessen our reliance on higher
cost sources of funding.
    31
    Table of Contents
    
  
We began experiencing a general decline in loans
beginning in 2009 as the full effect of the recession took hold. Loans declined approximately $199 million, or 7.5%, in 2010.
 
Our deposits declined $281 million, or 9.6%, in
2010. The decrease was primarily associated with time deposits, which are generally our highest cost source of funds. We also experienced
a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC
transaction account guarantee program.
 
Net interest income for the year ended December
31, 2010 amounted to $127.4 million, an 18.9% increase from 2009. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to 1) a
higher net interest margin, and 2) the higher average balances of loans and deposits realized from the June 2009 Cooperative Bank
acquisition.
 
Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest
income divided by average earnings assets) for 2010 was 4.39% compared to 3.81% for 2009. During 2010, there were no changes in
the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and we were able to continue to lower rates on our deposits, especially on maturing
time deposits that were originated in periods of higher interest rates. Also positively impacting net interest income were purchase
accounting adjustments, primarily related to our failed bank acquisition in 2009, including adjustments to loan interest income
previously discussed. See “Net Interest Income” below for additional discussion.
 
The economic environment, including its unfavorable
effect on real estate values, resulted in an increase in our loan losses and nonperforming assets, which led to significantly higher
provisions for loan losses in 2010. Our provision for loan losses amounted to $54.6 million for 2010 compared to $20.2 million
recorded in 2009. In 2010, our provision for loan losses was comprised of $33.6 million in provisions related to non-covered loans
and $20.9 million related to covered loans, whereas in prior years the provision only related to non-covered loans.
 
We recorded $33.6 million and $20.2 million in
provision for loan losses during 2010 and 2009, respectively, for non-covered loans. The higher provisions for loan losses were
necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate
values on our collateral dependent real estate loans.
 
We recorded $20.9 million in provision for loan
losses during 2010 related to covered loans that experienced credit quality deterioration. The credit quality deterioration primarily
related to collateral dependent loans for which we received updated appraisals during 2010 that reflected lower valuations.
 
Net loan charge-offs for 2010 were $42.5 million
compared to $12.1 million in 2009. Net charge-offs increased primarily as a result of declines in real estate values. In 2010,
net charge-offs were also impacted by charge-offs of covered loans and the recording of partial charge-offs of non-covered loans,
neither of which occurred during 2009. We recorded approximately $9.8 million in charge-offs of covered loans in 2010 compared
to none in 2009. Also, we recorded partial charge-offs of non-covered loans amounting to $8.6 million during the fourth quarter
of 2010. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses,
but did not record the charge-offs until the loans were foreclosed upon.
 
Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December
31, 2010 amounted to $117 million compared to $92 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, the ratio of non-covered
nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.16% compared to 3.10% at December 31, 2009.
    32
    Table of Contents
    
  
Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31,
2010 amounted to $168 million compared to $165 million at December 31, 2009.
 
Noninterest income for the year ended December
31, 2010 amounted to $29.1 million compared to $89.5 million for 2009. In 2009, we recorded a $67.9 million bargain purchase gain
in connection with the acquisition of a failed bank. In 2010, we recorded $35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed
property, the majority of which related to the market deterioration of foreclosed properties associated with the failed bank acquisition.
We recorded $41.8 million in indemnification asset income related to higher than anticipated claims that we will be able to make
with the FDIC under the loss share agreements, primarily relating to loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs.
 
Noninterest expenses for the year ended December
31, 2010 amounted to $87.0 million, a 10.7% increase from the $78.6 million recorded in 2009. Incremental operating expenses associated
with the failed bank acquisition were the primary reason for the increases in 2010. Included in other operating expenses for 2010
were approximately $2.6 million in costs (net of FDIC reimbursements) associated with collection activities on loans and foreclosed
properties covered by FDIC loss share agreements, compared to $0.8 million in 2009.
 
Our effective tax rates were 33.2% and 38.4% for
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to increased investment
holdings of tax-exempt municipal securities.
 
Outlook for 2012
 
We expect the banking industry, particularly in
our region, to continue to face significant challenges in 2012. While there has been some favorable national economic data reported
in recent months, we have seen little, if any, improvement in the unfavorable economic statistics affecting our region. These include
unemployment rates, housing starts, home prices, and the number of personal and business bankruptcies. We believe that the Carolinas
and Virginia may have been relatively late to experience the downturn in the national economy and that this region is lagging the
rest of the country in recovery. Thus, we believe that our loan losses will continue to remain at elevated levels compared to historical
norms. We also expect that the weak economy will continue to result in low loan demand.
 
We believe that regulatory reform will negatively
impact our earnings. The regulatory climate is not favorable for banks. We expect additional overhead costs will be necessary to
comply with all of the new regulations expected to arise directly or indirectly from the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
In 2009 and 2011 we acquired failed banks with
approximately $959 and $193 million in assets, respectively. These acquisitions resulted in significant volatility to our earnings
in 2009, 2010, and 2011, primarily as a result of the bargain purchase gains recorded on the acquisition dates that increased earnings
and write-downs of foreclosed properties in 2010 and 2011 that negatively impacted earnings. While we expect the acquisitions to
eventually be accretive to earnings on a consistent basis, we believe that they may continue to add volatility to our reported
earnings in 2012. The volatility may be positive to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired
loans improves, or negative to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans deteriorates
or if the properties we have foreclosed on continue to decline in value.

Critical Accounting Policies
 
The accounting principles we follow and our methods
of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general
practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve
the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets,
and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions are three policies we have identified
as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated
financial statements.
 
Allowance for Loan Losses
 
Due to the estimation process and the potential
materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision
for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged
to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb
losses inherent in the portfolio.
 
Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance
is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components.
The first component involves the estimation of losses on non-single family home loans or relationships greater than $500,000 that
are defined as “impaired loans.” A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events,
it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The estimated
valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined
by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan’s effective
rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral.
 
The second component of the allowance model is
an estimate of losses for impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and all loans
not considered to be impaired loans. Impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and
loans that we have classified as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type, and estimated loss percentages are assigned
to each loan type, based on the historical losses, current economic conditions, and operational conditions specific to each loan
type. Loans that we have risk graded as having more than “standard” risk but not considered to be impaired are segregated
between those relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000 and those that are less than that amount. For those loan
relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000, we review the attributes of each individual loan and assign any necessary
loss reserve based on various factors including payment history, borrower strength, collateral value, and guarantor strength. For
loan relationships less than $500,000 with more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired, loss percentages are based
on a multiple of the estimated loss rate for loans of a similar loan type with normal risk. The multiples assigned vary by type
of loan, depending on risk, and we have consulted with an external credit review firm in assigning those multiples.
 
The reserve estimated for impaired loans is then
added to the reserve estimated for all other loans. This becomes our “allocated allowance.” In addition to the allocated
allowance derived from the model, we also evaluate other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans,
net loan growth information, nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data. Based on this additional analysis, we may determine
that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses. This additional amount, if
any, is our “unallocated allowance.” The sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to
the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the
computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in
the period recorded.

    Table of Contents
    
  
Loans covered under loss share agreements are
recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become a part of the fair
value calculation and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected
result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the
amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan. Proportional adjustments are also recorded
to the FDIC indemnification asset.
 
Although we use the best information available
to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition,
various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses.
Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgment about information available
to them at the time of their examinations.
 
For further discussion, see “Nonperforming
Assets” and “Summary of Loan Loss Experience” below.
 
Intangible Assets
 
Due to the estimation process and the potential
materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical
to our consolidated financial statements.
 
When we complete an acquisition transaction, the
excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of
liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with
any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized
over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized.
Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible
assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a
lower amount classified as goodwill.
 
The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically
record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we
acquire an insurance agency, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining
the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically
determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions:
customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third
party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit
intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization.
For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life
of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis.
 
Subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed
above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting
units to their related carrying value, including goodwill (our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit).
If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value
of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the
goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions.
    35
    Table of Contents
    
  
At our last goodwill impairment evaluation as
of September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of our community banking operation was approximately $18.50 per common share,
or 8% higher, than the $17.08 stated book value of our common stock at the date of valuation. To assist us in computing the fair
value of our community banking operation, we engaged a consulting firm who used various valuation techniques as part of their analysis,
which resulted in the conclusion of the $18.50 value.
 
We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment
loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected
undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of
multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.
 
Fair Value and Discount Accretion of Loans
Acquired in FDIC-Assisted Transactions
 
We consider the determination of the initial fair
value of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions, the initial fair value of the related FDIC indemnification asset, and the
subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. We determine fair value
accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount
that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon
the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans
are different from the estimates, the FDIC indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the
loss-sharing support from the FDIC.
 
Because of the inherent credit losses associated
with the acquired loans in a failed bank acquisition, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less
than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the “discount”
on the acquired loans. We have applied the cost recovery method of accounting to all purchased impaired loans due to the uncertainty
as to the timing of expected cash flows. This will result in the recognition of interest income on these impaired loans only when
the cash payments received from the borrower exceed the recorded net book value of the related loans.
 
For nonimpaired purchased loans, we accrete the
discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.
 
Merger and Acquisition Activity
 
In both 2009 and 2011 we completed a FDIC-assisted
transaction of a failed bank. There were no significant acquisitions in 2010. The results of each acquired company/branch are included
in our financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information regarding these acquisitions.
 
In October 2011, we announced that we had entered
into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank, headquartered in Whiteville, North Carolina. The agreement
provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches from Waccamaw Bank, which includes assuming all deposits, selected performing
loans, and all premises and equipment. Deposits total approximately $180 million and loans total approximately $98 million. This
transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
for additional information.

FDIC Indemnification Asset
 
As previously discussed, on June 19, 2009 and
January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, respectively,
in FDIC-assisted transactions. For each transaction, the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two loss share
agreements with the FDIC, which afford First Bank significant loss protection. Under the Cooperative Bank loss share agreements,
the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million, and 95% of losses in excess of that
amount. Under The Bank of Asheville loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of all covered loan and foreclosed real estate
losses. For both transactions, the loss share reimbursements are applicable for ten years for single family home loans and five
years for all other loans.
 
We have recorded a FDIC indemnification asset
related to the two transactions to account for payments that we expect to receive from the FDIC related to the loss share agreements.
The carrying value of this receivable at each period end is the sum of: 1) actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for
reimbursement that have not yet been received and 2) our estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements
multiplied by the FDIC reimbursement percentage.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the FDIC indemnification
asset was comprised of the following components:
 
    ($ in thousands)  
    2011  
    2010
    Receivable related to claims submitted, not yet received  
    $ 13,377

    Receivable related to estimated future claims on loans  
      90,275

    Receivable related to estimated future claims on other real estate owned  
      18,025    
      6,552  
    FDIC indemnification asset  
    $ 121,677    
      123,719  
 
As of each acquisition date, based on the losses
inherent in the covered assets and what we estimated we would receive as payments from the FDIC, we recorded a “FDIC Indemnification
Asset.” Since that time, we have recorded adjustments to the indemnification asset as discussed below.
 
The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted
upwards in the following circumstances:
 
1) Deterioration of credit
quality of covered loans – As of the acquisition dates, we recorded the loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank
of Asheville on our books at a fair value that was $227.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively, less than the contractual amounts
due from the borrowers, which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of these portfolios
change and better information is obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally
projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected. For loans with worse repayment expectations,
we record provisions for loan losses with corresponding increases to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income
in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded provisions for loan losses on covered loans amounting
to $12.8 million and $20.9 million, respectively, which resulted in an adjustment to the FDIC indemnification asset of $10.2 million
and $16.7 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009.
 
2) Write-downs and losses
on foreclosed properties – When we foreclose on delinquent borrowers, we initially record the foreclosed property at the
lower of book or fair value (based on current appraisals), with any deficiency recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent to the foreclosure,
we periodically order updated appraisals and if the appraisal indicates a fair value lower than our carrying value, we must write
the property down. Also, periodically we sell foreclosed properties that result in losses. Each of these situations results in
the Company recording losses on other real estate owned with a corresponding increase to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording
noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded losses and write downs on covered
foreclosed properties amounting to $24.5 million and $34.5 million, respectively, which resulted in upward adjustments to the FDIC
indemnification asset of $19.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009.
    37
    Table of Contents
    
  
3) Expenses incurred related
to collection activities on covered assets – As a result of our collection efforts, we incur expenses such as legal fees,
property taxes and appraisal costs. Many of these expenses are reimbursable by the FDIC. These expenses are recorded as “other”
noninterest expenses and a corresponding increase is made to increase the FDIC indemnification asset by reducing the gross collection
expenses by the amount expected to be reimbursed by the FDIC for eligible expenses. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred $8.5 million,
$5.5 million, and $2.1 million in gross collection expenses related to covered assets, respectively, and reduced that amount by
$5.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.3 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively.
 
The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted
downwards in the following circumstances:
 
1) Receipt of cash from the
FDIC related to claims submitted – On at least a quarterly basis, we submit eligible loss share claims to the FDIC. After
reviewing and approving the claims, the FDIC wires us cash, which reduces the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset. In 2011,
2010 and 2009, we received $69.3 million, $46.7 million and $40.5 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively.
 
2) Accretion of discount on
acquired loans – As noted above, we recorded the acquired loans of the two transactions on our books at a fair value that
was $280 million (in total) less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers (the “discount”), which was our
estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of this portfolio changes and better information is
obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse
repayment expectations than originally projected (discussed above). For loans with improved repayment expectations, we are systematically
reducing the discount over the life of the loan as it repays. For some loans, we have received complete payoffs at the contractual
balance and the discount must be reduced to zero. When we reduce/accrete the discount, we do so by recognizing interest income
in that same amount. When the expected losses on loans with improved repayment expectations becomes less than the original estimate,
our expected reimbursement from the FDIC declines as well. Accordingly, we reduce the FDIC indemnification asset by the corresponding
reimbursement percentage. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded discount accretion of $11.6 million, $7.6 million, and $1.5 million,
respectively, which resulted in a reduction of FDIC indemnification asset of $9.3 million, $6.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.
 
In summary, circumstances that result in adjustments
to the FDIC indemnification asset are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss
share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in
covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations.
The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income.
 
The adjustments can result in volatility within
individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset, pretax
income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses, interest income, and losses from foreclosed properties is
generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Net interest income, the “spread”
between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, constitutes the largest source
of our earnings. Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income
such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs,
as well as the effects of income taxes.
 
Net Interest Income
 
Net interest income on a reported basis amounted
to $132.2 million in 2011, $127.4 million in 2010, and $107.1 million in 2009. For internal purposes and in the discussion that
follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt securities
to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $133.8 million in 2011, $128.7 million in
2010, and $107.9 million in 2009. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful
and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different
mix of taxable versus non-taxable investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of
reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income.

Table 2 analyzes net interest income on a tax-equivalent
basis. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.0% in 2011 and 19.2% in 2010. There are two primary factors
that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances, and 2) our net
interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets).
    39
    Table of Contents
    
  
For 2011, the increase in net interest income
over the comparable period in 2010 was due to a higher net interest margin, which was partially offset by a lower level of earning
assets due to a contraction of our balance sheet during 2011. In 2010, higher average loan and deposit balances increased net interest
income. Also, the positive effects of the increased balances in 2010 were enhanced by a higher net interest margin.
 
Although our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville
in early 2011 resulted in the addition of $102 million in loans, our average loan balances declined by $92 million during the year
- from $2.55 billion in 2010 to $2.46 billion in 2011. We believe the decline in loans is primarily a direct and indirect result
of the weak economy in our market area. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million
that reduced our loan balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank
acquisitions. Also, loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially
offsetting new loan originations. With the decline in loans, we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding,
including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits, which resulted in lower deposit balances (and, as discussed below,
a lower average cost of funds).
 
Although loans and deposits outstanding decreased
during calendar year 2010, the average balances of loans and deposits were both higher in 2010 than they were in 2009 as a result
of the Cooperative Bank acquisition that occurred in mid-2009. The loans and deposits acquired in this acquisition impacted loan
and deposit balances outstanding for all twelve months of 2010 and for the six month period subsequent to the June 2009 acquisition.
 
As illustrated in Table 3, the lower average loan
and deposit balances negatively impacted net interest income in 2011, while higher balances positively impacted net interest income
in 2010. In 2011, declines in interest-earning assets, primarily loans, resulted in a decrease in interest income of $4.4 million,
while lower amounts of interest-bearing liabilities resulted in only $0.4 million of lower interest expense. As a result, the net
impact of lower loans and deposits was a decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income of $4.0 million in 2011. In 2010, growth
in interest-earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of $6.1 million, while higher amounts of interest-bearing
liabilities only resulted in $0.5 million in increased interest expense. As a result, the higher average balances of loans and
deposits resulted in an increase in tax-equivalent net interest income of $5.6 million in 2010.
 
Table 3 also illustrates the impact that changes
in the interest rates that we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2010 and 2011. In both years, lower interest rates
on deposits was the primary factor affecting net interest income. Although the prime rate of interest has not changed since 2008,
interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds and other interest-sensitive financial instruments have steadily declined since then, resulting
in a generally lower interest rate environment. In both years, the progressively lower interest rate environment gave us the opportunity
to reduce rates on matured time deposits, and we were also able to gradually reduce interest rates on demand deposits. In 2010,
the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by $17.5 million and in 2011 the lower interest rates reduced interest expense
by $7.9 million. The lower interest rate environment had much less impact on our interest income, with the impact of changes in
interest rates lowering interest income by $2.3 million in 2010 and increasing it by $1.2 million in 2011. The lesser impact was
due to continued use of interest rate floors on loans, as well as the effect of higher levels of loan discount accretion in both
2010 and 2011 (discussed below). Overall, changes in interest rates increased net interest income by $15.2 million in 2010 and
$9.1 million in 2011.
 
We measure the spread between the yield on our
earning assets and the cost of our funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled “net interest margin” which is
defined as tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Our net interest margin increased 33 basis points
in 2011 to 4.72% from 4.39% in 2010. Our net interest margin was 3.81% in 2009.
    40
    Table of Contents
    
  
The primary reason for the increases in our net
interest margin has been that the yields on interest-earning assets have remained fairly stable over the past three years, ranging
from 5.48% to 5.55%, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities has steadily declined from 1.96% in 2009 to 1.20% in 2010 to
0.90% in 2011. As noted above, our interest-earning asset yields have remained stable because of the continued use of interest
rate floors on loans, as well as higher levels of loan discount accretion. Also as noted above, we have been able to lower rates
on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher rates throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. And to a lesser degree,
we have been able to progressively lower interest rates on various types of savings, NOW and money market accounts. We have also
experienced declines in our levels of higher cost deposit balances, including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits.
 
During each of the past three years, our net interest
margin also benefitted from the net accretion of purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with the Cooperative Bank acquisition
in June 2009 and, to a lesser degree, the acquisition of Great Pee Dee Bancorp in April 2008 and The Bank of Asheville in January
2011. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $11.6 million, $10.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, in net accretion of purchase
accounting premiums/discounts that increased net interest income. The following table provides detail of the purchase accounting
adjustments that impacted net interest income:

Note - We cannot determine the amount of interest
income, if any, to be recognized from the accretion of the loan discount on Cooperative loans or The Bank of Asheville loans because
it is reliant on our ongoing assessment during the year of the repayment period of the loans, which is impacted by any changes
in expected credit losses related to the loans.

income in the section entitled “Interest Rate Risk.”
 
Provision for Loan Losses
 
The provision for loan losses charged to operations
is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable
losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level
of loan growth, an evaluation of the portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors.
 
Our provisions for loan losses and nonperforming
assets remain at what we believe to be elevated levels, primarily due to high unemployment rates and declining property values
in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. For 2011, 2010, and 2009 our total provisions
for loan losses were $41.3 million, $54.6 million, and $20.2 million, respectively. The total provision for loan losses is comprised
of provision for loan losses for non-covered loans and provision for loan losses for covered loans, as discussed in the following
paragraphs.
    41
    Table of Contents
    
  
We recorded $28.5 million, $33.6 million, and
$20.2 million in provisions for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the years-ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009,
respectively. The lower provision for loan losses for non-covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to stabilization
in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans. The higher provision for non-covered loans in 2010
was necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate
values on our collateral dependent real estate loans.
 
In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $12.8 million and
$20.9 million in provisions for loan losses for covered loans, respectively, that experienced credit quality deterioration. The
credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals
in 2011 and 2010 that reflected lower valuations. The lower provision for loan losses for covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010
was primarily due to lower levels of nonperforming covered loans. Because of the FDIC loss-share agreements in place for these
loans, the FDIC indemnification asset was adjusted upwards by recording noninterest income of $10.2 million and $16.7 million in
2011 and 2010, respectively, or 80% of the amount of the provisions (see discussion above).
 
Total net charge-offs for the years ended December
31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, were $49.3 million, $42.5 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. As discussed further below, the higher
net charge-offs in 2010 and 2011 compared to 2009 were primarily a result of worsening economic conditions, especially related
to real estate, that resulted in higher levels of borrowers not repaying their loans.
 
Net-charge offs for non-covered loans were $31.2
million, $32.7 million and $12.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Net charge-offs of non-covered loans were impacted
by $9.0 million and $8.6 million in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Prior to 2010 we
recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses, but did not record charge-offs
until the loans had been foreclosed upon.
 
Net charge-offs for covered loans were $18.1 million,
$9.8 million, and $0 in for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The charge-offs of covered loans were primarily a result of declining
collateral values on collateral dependent nonaccrual loans.
 
In 2011 and 2010, our provisions for loan losses
and net charge-offs were concentrated in loans classified as “real estate – construction, land development & other
land loans.” This category of loans is primarily comprised of land acquisition and development loans and other types of lot
loans. These types of loans have been particularly hard hit by the decline in real estate development and property values. As can
be seen in Table 10, although we have reduced our exposure to this category of loans, we continue to have exposure to this sector
and future significant losses could result.
 
Non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31,
2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million and $92 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December
31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% and 3.10% at December
31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also see “Nonperforming Assets” below for additional discussion.
 
See the section entitled “Allowance for
Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience” below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance
is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain
an adequate allowance for loan losses.

Noninterest Income
 
Our noninterest income amounted to $26.2 million
in 2011, $29.1 million in 2010, and $89.5 million in 2009.
 
As shown in Table 4, core noninterest income excludes
gains from acquisitions, foreclosed property write-downs and losses, indemnification asset income, securities gains or losses,
and other miscellaneous gains and losses. Core noninterest income amounted to $23.2 million in 2011, a 4.7% increase from $22.1
million in 2010. The 2010 core noninterest income of $22.1 million was 1.2% higher than the $21.9 million recorded in 2009.
 
See Table 4 and the following discussion for an
understanding of the components of noninterest income.
 
Service charges on deposit accounts in 2011 amounted
to $12.0 million, a 2.9% decrease compared to $12.3 million recorded in 2010. The $12.3 million recorded in 2010 was 5.9% less
than the 2009 amount of $13.1 million. Legislation that became effective on July 1, 2010 reduced our fees earned on overdrafts
in 2010 and 2011, which was the primary reason for the declines in this component of noninterest income. Specifically, the legislation
now prohibits us from charging an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s
account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to our payment of overdrafts for these transactions. Additional
regulations on overdraft fees became effective July 1, 2011 that further reduced our overdraft fees, although to a lesser extent
than the 2010 changes. In April 2011, we implemented new fees on deposit accounts, such as fees for customers that elect to receive
paper statements, that have helped to replace a large portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the overdraft legislation.
 
Other service charges, commissions and fees amounted
to $8.1 million in 2011, a 24.0% increase from the $6.5 million earned in 2010. The 2010 amount of $6.5 million was a 13.6% increase
from the $5.7 million earned in 2009. This category of noninterest income includes items such as electronic payment processing
revenue (which includes fees related to credit card transactions by merchants and customers and fees earned from debit card transactions),
ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The growth in this category
for both years was primarily attributable to increased debit card usage by our customers, as we earn a small fee each time our
customers make a debit card transaction. Also, part of the increase in this category is due to the overall growth in our total
customer base, including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions.
 
Fees from presold mortgages amounted to $1.6 million
in 2011, $1.8 million in 2010, and $1.5 million in 2009. We continue to experience higher mortgage refinance activity due to lower
interest rates.
 
Commissions from sales of insurance and financial
products amounted to $1.5 million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009. This line item includes commissions we receive from three sources
- 1) sales of credit life insurance associated with new loans, 2) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long-term
care insurance products, and 3) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the
contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item:

Noninterest income not considered to be “core”
resulted in a net contribution to total noninterest income of $3.0 million in 2011, $7.0 million in 2010, and $67.6 million in
2009. The components of non-core noninterest income are shown in Table 4 and the significant components thereof are discussed below.
 
In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $27.8 million and
$35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed properties, respectively, of which $24.5 million and $34.5 million related
to write-downs on covered properties, respectively. Consistent with the other failed bank accounting adjustments discussed earlier,
the bottom line impact to pretax income of these write-downs on covered properties was 20% of the gross write-downs.
 
Indemnification asset income for 2011 and 2010
amounted to $20.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively (with no corresponding amount in 2009). This income primarily relates
to upward adjustments to the amount expected to be received from the FDIC under loss share agreements as a result of higher than
anticipated loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs, as follows:

    Indemnification asset income  
    $ 20.5    
    $ 41.8  
 
In 2011 and 2009, as previously discussed, we
realized gains from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of failed banks amounting to $10.2 million and $67.9 million, respectively,
which were the amounts by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed in each transaction.
 
The line item “Other gains (losses)”
was positively impacted in 2010 by the sale of our merchant credit card processing portfolio, which resulted in a gain of $850,000.
 
Noninterest Expenses
 
Noninterest expenses for 2011 were $96.1 million,
compared to $87.0 million in 2010 and $78.6 million in 2009. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during
the past three years.
 
As reflected in the amounts noted above, noninterest
expenses increased 10.5% in 2011 and 10.7% in 2010. The increases in noninterest expenses over the past three years have occurred
in almost every line item of expense and have been primarily a result of our significant growth. Due to acquisition and internal
growth, over the past three years our number of bank branches has increased from 74 to 97, and the number of full time equivalent
employees has increased from 650 at December 31, 2008 to 830 at December 31, 2011. Additionally, from December 31, 2008 to December
31, 2011, the amount of loans outstanding increased 9.9% and deposits increased 32.8%.
    44
    Table of Contents
    
  
Total personnel expense increased by approximately
$6.1 million, or 13.6%, in 2011. Salaries expense comprised $4.7 million of this increase, which was primarily a result of an initiative
to progressively build our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities, and overall growth of
the Company, as well as to prepare for future growth. Another factor in the increase in salaries expense in 2011 was the acquisition
of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011, which added approximately 35 employees. Higher employee health insurance costs also played
a role in the increase in personnel expense in 2011. Employee health insurance expense amounted to $4.4 million in 2011, an increase
of $1.3 million over the $3.1 million incurred in 2010. We self-insure our employees’ health care expense; therefore, incurred
health care costs directly impact the expense we record.
 
In 2010, salaries expense increased $4.3 million,
primarily due to a full year of salaries related to employees assumed in the June 2009 Cooperative acquisition. The increase in
salary expense was partially offset by lower health care expenses of $0.4 million and lower pension expense in 2010 of $0.6 million.
Pension expense decreased during 2010 primarily due to investment gains experienced by the pension plan’s assets in 2009.
 
In 2011 and 2009, we incurred acquisition expenses
of approximately $0.6 million in connection with The Bank of Asheville acquisition and $1.3 million in connection with the Cooperative
Bank acquisition, respectively. Acquisition expenses for both periods consisted primarily of professional fees.
 
FDIC deposit insurance expense declined in each
of the past two years. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, we incurred approximately $5.5 million, $4.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively,
in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense. The $5.5 million in FDIC insurance expense for 2009 included a special assessment, which
applied to all banks, of $1.6 million. As previously discussed, the FDIC changed its premium assessment methodology in April 2011,
which was favorable for our company and reduced our expense in 2011.
 
Due to higher levels of delinquencies and foreclosure
activity, including those associated with our covered assets, we recorded $5.5 million in repossession and collection expenses,
net of FDIC reimbursements, in 2011, compared to $4.8 million in 2010 and $1.7 million in 2009.
 
Within the “non-credit losses” presented
in Table 5, we recorded $1 million in 2011 in connection with a fraud loss.
 
Income Taxes
 
The provision for income taxes was $7.4 million
in 2011, $5.0 million in 2010, and $37.6 million in 2009.
 
Table 6 presents the components of tax expense
and the related effective tax rates. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 35.1% compared to 33.2% in 2010 and 38.4% in 2009. The
variances in effective tax rates are primarily due to changes in the proportion of tax-exempt interest income to pretax income.
We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35% in 2012.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
 
We recorded stock-based compensation expense of
$0.9 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 15 to
the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock-based compensation.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES
IN FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
Overview
 
Over the past two years, our total assets have
decreased from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009 to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011, which was primarily due to declines in our
outstanding loans and deposits. Changes in our loans and deposit balances occur as a result of organic growth or decline, as well
as acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2011, we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC-assisted failed bank transaction.

(1) Excludes the impact of acquisitions in the
year of the acquisition, but includes growth or declines in acquired operations after the date of acquisition.
 
In 2011, as derived from the table above, our
total loans declined $24 million, or 1.0%. Positively impacting loans outstanding was our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville
on January 21, 2011, which added $102 million in loans. However, this increase was more than offset by loan payoffs, foreclosures
and loan charge-offs. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million that reduced our loan
balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions. Also, loan
demand in most of our market areas has remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan
originations. In addition, we have de-emphasized certain types of lending, most notably acquisition and development land loans
and non-owner occupied commercial real estate.
    46
    Table of Contents
    
  
However, for the first time since our loans outstanding
began trending downward in 2008, we experienced sequential quarterly growth in our non-covered loan portfolio during each of the
last two quarters of 2011, with non-covered loans increasing by $28 million during the last half of 2011. We are actively pursuing
lending opportunities in order to improve asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our SBLF preferred

To start 2011, our total deposits increased by
$193 million as a result of the January acquisition of The Bank of Asheville. For the remainder of the year, as our loans declined,
we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding, including internet deposits and time deposits, which resulted
in generally declining deposit balances. Our lowest cost deposits, noninterest bearing demand accounts and NOW accounts, experienced
positive internal growth of $24 million and $99 million, respectively. In addition to our bank-wide emphasis to grow these types
of low-rate accounts, the increase in NOW accounts was impacted by $38 million in customer funds that were shifted from repurchase
agreements (securities sold under agreements to repurchase) to NOW accounts during late 2011. In July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act
repealed certain sections of the Federal Reserve Act that prohibited payment of interest on commercial demand deposits. With this
prohibition removed, we began to pay interest on certain types of commercial demand accounts, and we encouraged our customers with
repurchase agreements to switch to commercial NOW accounts, which eliminated the need to sell/pledge our investment securities.
 
For the same reasons as discussed above for 2011,
we experienced a decline in loans of 7.5% in 2010. In 2010, we also experienced a decline in deposits of 9.6%, with most of the
decline occurring in retail time deposits. Retail time deposits are generally a high cost source of funds for us, and during 2010
we decided not to match promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we felt
were too high compared to alternative funding sources, and consequently we experienced a loss of time deposits.
 
Also declining significantly in 2010 was our level
of internet time deposits. Our level of time deposits gathered from internet posting services declined from $128 million at December
31, 2009 to $47 million at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of our internet deposits during 2010 were assumed in the Cooperative
acquisition in 2009. Prior to its closing, Cooperative was prohibited from originating or renewing brokered deposits and accordingly,
they enhanced liquidity by offering relatively high interest rates on internet posting services. As these time deposits have matured,
the internet depositors, mostly credit unions, have elected not to renew the time deposits at the interest rates we have proposed.
In 2010, we replaced most of the lost internet deposits with brokered deposits, which had more favorable interest rates. As a result,
our brokered deposits increased from $76 million at December 31, 2009 to $144 million at December 31, 2010.
 
We also experienced a $70 million decrease in
our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds in the last week of the year in
anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program. This program previously
provided unlimited FDIC insurance for interest bearing transaction accounts earning interest rates up to 0.25%. Subsequent to this
change, the only accounts with unlimited FDIC insurance are non-interest bearing transaction accounts.
 
Our overall liquidity increased slightly during
2011 compared to 2010. We experienced a $103 million increase in deposits, while loans decreased $24 million. With the excess deposits,
we were able to reduce our borrowings by approximately $63 million during 2011. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage
of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to 15.7% at December 31, 2011.
 
Our capital ratios improved in 2011. All of our
capital ratios have continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for “well-capitalized” status for all periods covered
by this report.

    Table of Contents
    
  
Due to the continued economic slowdown, our asset
quality ratios remain at unfavorable levels compared to most of our company’s history. Our non-covered nonperforming assets
to total non-covered assets ratio was 4.30% at December 31, 2011 compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010, and 3.10% at December
31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our ratio of net non-covered charge-offs to average non-covered loans was 1.52%
compared to 1.55% for 2010, and 0.56% for 2009.
 
Distribution of Assets and Liabilities
 
Table 7 sets forth the percentage relationships
of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.
 
Our balance sheet distribution has remained relatively
stable over the past three years. The increase in NOW deposits discussed earlier resulted in an increase in this category from
9% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010 to 13% in 2011. Also, over the past two years we have
experienced a decline in retail time deposits less than $100,000 (“other time deposits”) that has resulted in other
time deposits declining from 23% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in 2009 to 18% in 2011.
 
Securities
 
Information regarding our securities portfolio
as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is presented in Tables 8 and 9.
 
The composition of the investment securities portfolio
reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of
income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance
sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge
as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for the vast majority of our investment securities from a third-party
investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides
us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We
further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation
service on a quarterly basis.
 
Total securities amounted to $240.6 million, $235.2
million, and $214.2 million, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
The majority of our “government-sponsored
enterprise” securities are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank and carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature.
At December 31, 2011, of the $35 million (carrying value) in government-sponsored enterprise securities, $21 million were issued
by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $14 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system.
 
Our $124 million of mortgage-backed securities
have all been issued by either Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the Small Business Administration, each of which are government-sponsored
corporations. We have no “private label” mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment
in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.
 
Included in mortgage-backed securities at December
31, 2011 were collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) with an amortized cost of $1.5 million and a fair value
of $1.5 million. The CMOs that we have invested in are substantially all “early tranche” portions of the CMOs, which
minimizes our long-term interest rate risk.

Substantially all of our investment in equity
securities at each year end was comprised of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). The FHLB requires us
to purchase their stock in order to borrow from them. The amount they require us to invest is based on our level of borrowings
from them. At December 31, 2011, our investment in capital stock of the FHLB amounted to $10.9 million of our total investment
in equity securities of $11.4 million. Until February 27, 2009, the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as borrowings were repaid.
On February 27, 2009, the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when loans are repaid. Instead,
they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis. During 2010 and 2011, the FHLB repurchased
$1.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of their stock from the Company.
 
The fair value of securities held to maturity,
which we carry at amortized cost, was $4,766,000 more than the carrying value at December 31, 2011 and $706,000 less than the carrying
value at December 31, 2010. Our $58.0 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued
by state and local governments throughout our market area. We have only two municipal bonds with a denomination greater than $2,000,000
and we have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity, with the single largest exposure to any one
entity being $3,700,000. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them
to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers
to meet their obligations.
 
At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, a net unrealized
gain of $3,896,000, $2,478,000, and $1,832,000, respectively, was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available
for sale. During the past three years, interest rates have generally declined, which typically increases the value of our investment
securities. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a
temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about
the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains, net of applicable deferred income taxes, of $2,376,000,
$1,512,000, and $1,117,000 have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders’ equity (accumulated other
comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield
for the securities available for sale portfolio was 3.01% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the available
for sale portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds, the maturity date for all other non-mortgage-backed securities,
and the expected life for mortgage-backed securities, was 5.2 years.
 
The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield
for the securities held to maturity portfolio was 5.78% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the held to
maturity portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities, was 6.6
years.

Loans
 
Table 10 provides a summary of the loan portfolio
composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends.
 
As previously discussed, in our acquisitions of
Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC, which afford us significant protection
from losses on all loans and other real estate acquired in those acquisitions. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC,
the financial risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans is significantly different from assets not covered under
the loss share agreements. Accordingly, we present separately loans subject to the FDIC loss share agreements as “covered
loans” and loans that are not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered loans.” Table 10a presents
a breakout of covered and non-covered loans as of December 31, 2011.
 
The loan portfolio is the largest category of
our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and consumer
loans. We restrict virtually all of our lending to our 36 county market area, which is located in western, central and eastern
North Carolina, four counties in southern Virginia and five counties in northeastern South Carolina. The diversity of the region’s
economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment.
 
In 2011, loans outstanding decreased $23.7 million,
or 1.0% to $2.43 billion. In 2010, loans outstanding decreased $198.7 million, or 7.5% to $2.45 billion. As previously discussed,
the declines for both years were mainly due to loan payoffs and loan foreclosures exceeding new loan growth as loan demand in most
of our market areas remained weak.
 
The majority of our loan portfolio over the years
has been real estate mortgage loans, with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising 86% to 90% of our outstanding loan
balances. Except for real estate construction, land development and other land loans, the majority of our “real estate”
loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower’s occupation or business is the primary repayment
source, with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source.
 
Table 10 indicates that the two types of loans
that have had the largest variances in the amount outstanding as a percent of total loans have been construction/land development
loans and residential mortgage loans. In 2005 we expanded our branch network to what was then the fast-growing southeast coast
of North Carolina, which had a high demand for construction and land development loans. In 2008, due to recessionary conditions,
particularly in the new housing market, loan demand for these types of loans weakened and we tightened our loan underwriting criteria
for these types of loans, which reduced growth. Due to economic conditions, for the past three years we have made very few new
acquisition and land development loans, and we expect this trend to continue.
    50
    Table of Contents
    
  
Our concentration of residential mortgage loans
increased in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, because Cooperative’s loan portfolio was heavily concentrated
in residential mortgages.
 
In 2011, due to The Bank of Asheville acquisition,
our percentage of commercial real estate loans increased slightly as that bank’s primary business had been commercial lending.
 
Table 11 provides a summary of scheduled loan
maturities over certain time periods, with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately. Approximately 23% of our
accruing loans outstanding at December 31, 2011 mature within one year and 67% of total loans mature within five years. As of December
31, 2011, the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were 47% and 53%, respectively.
We intentionally make a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk.
 
Nonperforming Assets
 
Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and other real estate. As a matter of
policy we place all loans that are past due 90 or more days on nonaccrual basis, and thus there were no loans at any of the past
five year ends that were 90 days past due and still accruing interest.
 
Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income
is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful. Placing
loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because (i) interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed
on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income, (ii) future accruals of interest income are not recognized
until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and (iii) principal charged-off, if appropriate, may necessitate
additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial
difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms.
 
Table 12 summarizes our nonperforming assets at
the dates indicated. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, we present separately nonperforming assets subject to
the loss share agreements as “covered” and nonperforming assets that are not subject to the loss share agreements as
“non-covered.”
 
Due largely to the economic downturn that began
in late 2007 and continued to worsen over the past few years, we have experienced increases in our non-covered nonperforming assets.
Our total nonperforming assets were also significantly impacted by the Cooperative acquisition in 2009.
 
Table 12a presents our nonperforming assets at
December 31, 2011 by general geographic region and further segregated into “covered” nonperforming assets and “non-covered”
nonperforming assets. The majority of our nonperforming assets are located in the Eastern North Carolina region, which has experienced
the most negative effects of the recession of any of our regions.
 
Non-covered nonperforming loans totaled $85.2
million, $96.0 million, and $83.5 million, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Total non-covered nonperforming
loans as a percentage of total non-covered loans amounted to 4.12%, 4.61%, and 3.91%, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, non-covered
troubled debt restructurings amounted to $11.7 million, $33.7 million, and $21.3 million, respectively. The decline in 2011 is
primarily a result of troubled debt restructurings that re-defaulted and were placed on nonaccrual status. The increase in 2010
was the result of our initiative to work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by modifying certain loan terms.
    51
    Table of Contents
    
  
We also had $14.2 million and $14.4 million of
covered troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to none in 2009.

The tables above indicate that covered nonaccrual
loans declined from $58.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $41.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily a result
of many of the nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 being either charged-off or being foreclosed upon in 2011 and their balances
being transferred to other real estate during the year.
 
Non-covered nonaccrual loans increased from $62.3
million at December 31, 2010 to $73.6 million at December 31, 2011, which was the result of continued economic hardship in our
market areas, particularly for the commercial real estate business.

If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the
period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $8,724,000,
$8,136,000 and $9,800,000 for nonaccrual loans and $1,873,000, $1,943,000 and $1,200,000 for restructured loans would have been
recorded for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net
income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $2,578,000, $3,195,000 and $2,147,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their
being placed on nonaccrual status), and $1,351,000, $1,342,000, and $866,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December
31, 2011 and 2010, we had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.
 
Management routinely monitors the status of certain
large loans that, in management’s opinion, have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans. In
addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above, management believes that an estimated $5 million of non-covered loans
and $16 million of covered loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December 31, 2011 have the
potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general.
Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses
at December 31, 2011 (see discussion below).
 
Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss,
doubtful, substandard, or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan
amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially
impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources, or represent material credits about which management is aware
of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment
terms.
 
Other real estate includes foreclosed, repossessed,
and idled properties. Non-covered other real estate has increased over the past three years, amounting to $37.0 million at December
31, 2011, $21.1 million at December 31, 2010, and $8.8 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we also
held $85.3 million, $94.9 million and $47.4 million, respectively, in other real estate that is subject to loss share agreements
with the FDIC. We believe that the fair values of the items of other real estate, less estimated costs
to sell, equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented.

Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience
 
The allowance for loan losses is created by direct
charges to operations (known as a “provision for loan losses” for the period in which the charge is taken). Losses
on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans, in management’s opinion, become uncollectible.
The recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance. We consider our procedures for recording the amount of
the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy. See the heading “Critical
Accounting Policies” above for further discussion.
 
The factors that influence management’s
judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio,
evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions.
 
We use a loan analysis and grading program to
facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. In this program,
credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an independent third party consulting firm. The testing program includes
an evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses, loans past due 90 days or more,
loans originated by new loan officers, nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations.
 
We strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance
with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs
of our market areas. Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies. We
have no foreign loans, few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions.
Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries. The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as
“real estate” loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan.
Collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within our principal market area.
 
The allowance for loan losses amounted to $41.4
million at December 31, 2011 compared to $49.4 million at December 31, 2010 and $37.3 million at December 31, 2009. At December
31, 2011 and 2010, $5.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses is attributable to covered loans
that have exhibited credit quality deterioration due to lower collateral valuations, while the allowance for loan losses for non-covered
loans amounted to $35.6 million and $38.3 million at those dates. For all prior periods, the entire allowance for loan losses is
attributable to non-covered loans.
    54
    Table of Contents
    
  
The ratio of the allowance
for non-covered loan losses to non-covered loans was 1.72%, 1.84%, and 1.75%, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
The decrease in the percentage for 2011 is primarily attributable to lower specific reserves at December 31, 2011. The increased
allowance percentage in 2010 was necessary due to the higher level of delinquencies and classified and nonperforming loans.
 
Table 13 sets forth the allocation of the allowance
for loan losses at the dates indicated. The amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially
at any of the past three year ends. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories. Table 13a segregates
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 into covered and non-covered categories. As indicated
in Tables 13 and 13a, the amount of the allowance allocated to “Real Estate – Construction and Land Development”
declined by $5-$6 million from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This decline was due to charge-offs and the foreclosure
and transfer to “other real estate” of a significant amount of covered land development loans.
 
Management considers the allowance for loan losses
adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date. It must be emphasized, however, that
the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic
conditions and other factors affecting loans. No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan
losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of conditions
and factors then prevailing, will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings.
 
In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an
integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate.
Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgments about information
available to them at the time of their examinations.
 
For the years indicated, Table 14 summarizes our
balances of loans outstanding, average loans outstanding, and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses.
 
Table 14a presents a detailed rollforward of the
2011 and 2010 activity for the allowance for loan losses segregated into covered and non-covered activity.
 
Net loan charge-offs of non-covered loans amounted
to $31.2 million in 2011, $32.7 million in 2010, and $12.1 million in 2009. The elevated amounts in 2010 and 2011 reflect the impact
of deteriorating loan quality that has been impacted by the economic downturn. Also in 2010 and 2011, we recorded $8.6 million
and $9.0 million, respectively, in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient
nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loans losses, but did not record charge-offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon.
Net non-covered charge-offs as a percentage of average non-covered loans represented 1.52%, 1.55%, and 0.56%, during 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively.
 
We recorded $18.1 million and $9.8 million in
charge-offs of covered loans during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for
which we received updated appraisals that reflected lower valuations.

Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements
to Repurchase
 
At December 31, 2011, deposits outstanding amounted
to $2.755 billion, an increase of $103 million from December 31, 2010. To begin 2011, deposits initially grew by $193 million as
a result of the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. For the remainder of the year, our deposit base declined
by $90 million as a lack of loan growth allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits. Our NOW deposits increased approximately
$131 million during 2011, with $31 million being assumed in The Bank of Asheville acquisition and another $38 million of the growth
resulting from customers shifting their funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to a commercial interest bearing
NOW account (discussed earlier). In 2011, despite the addition of $62 million in time deposits and $43 million in internet deposits
from The Bank of Asheville acquisition, we experienced overall net declines in these categories of $73 million and $17 million,
respectively, due to our ability to lessen our reliance on these higher cost deposits as a result of weak loan demand and growth
in our other lower-cost deposit categories.
 
In 2010, deposits declined from $2.933 billion
to $2.653 billion, a decrease of $281 million, or 9.6%, from December 31, 2009. Approximately $237 million, or 84%, of the decline
in deposits was attributable to decreases in time deposits. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during
2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds during the last week of the year in anticipation of the
expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program.
 
The nature of our deposit growth is illustrated
in the table on page 46. The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends:
 
       
    2011  
    2010

The deposit mix remained
relatively consistent from 2009 to 2011. Our mix has gradually shifted over the past few years to a heavier concentration in transaction
accounts and less concentration in our time deposits. The percentages for retail time deposits have declined because we have chosen
not to match certain promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we
felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources. Our growth in other categories of deposits and our weak loan demand
eliminated the need to match the higher competitor rates.
 
We routinely engage
in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers,
where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels
that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract
customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.
 
Table 15 presents the average amounts of our deposits
and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.
    56
    Table of Contents
    
  
As of December 31, 2011, we held approximately
$753.2 million in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Table 16 is a maturity schedule of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of
December 31, 2011. This table shows that 66% of our time deposits greater than $100,000 mature within one year.
 
At each of the past three year ends, we have no
deposits issued through foreign offices, nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors.
 
Borrowings
 
We had borrowings outstanding of $133.9 million
at December 31, 2011 compared to $196.9 million at December 31, 2010 and $176.8 million at December 31, 2009. Borrowings decreased
from 2010 to 2011 primarily as a result of a decline in loans and growth in deposits that provided funds to pay down our borrowings.
During most of 2010, we held a lower level of borrowings until late in the year when we obtained borrowings to offset a portion
of the liquidity decline we experienced as a result of the loss of deposits that was previously discussed. Table 2 shows that average
borrowings were $122.7 million in 2011 compared to $79.8 million in 2010 and $151.2 million in 2009.
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four sources
of readily available borrowing capacity – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, of which $88 million
was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $62 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds
line of credit with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $33 million was outstanding at
December 31, 2010, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s (FRB) discount
window, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $55 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4) a $10 million
holding company line of credit with a commercial bank (none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010).
 
Our line of credit with the FHLB can be structured
as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by our FHLB
stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, none of the $88 million outstanding
with the FHLB were overnight borrowings. All the FHLB borrowings were at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 1.36%
and maturity dates ranging from April 2012 to June 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the average amount of FHLB borrowings
outstanding was approximately $76 million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 1.49%. The maximum amount of short-term
FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011 was $92 million.
 
In addition to the outstanding borrowings from
the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, our borrowing capacity was further reduced by $203
million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each
of those dates.
 
Our correspondent bank relationship allows us
to purchase up to $50 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). We had no borrowings
under this line at December 31, 2011. We had $33 million outstanding under this line at December 31, 2010 with a weighted average
interest rate of 0.65%. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month-end during 2011.
 
We also have a line of credit with the FRB discount
window. This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate
loans). Based on the collateral that we owned as of December 31, 2011, the available line of credit was approximately $79 million.
At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line. At December 31, 2010, we had $55 million in borrowings
outstanding under this line. There were no FRB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011.

    Table of Contents
    
  
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a $10 million
holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by 100% of the common stock of our bank subsidiary. This
line of credit expires and is subject to renewal in March of each year. The line of credit had no outstanding balance at December
31, 2011 or 2010, and was not drawn upon during 2011 or 2010.
 
In addition to the lines of credit described above,
in which we had $88 million and $150 million outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, we also had a total of
$46.4 million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010. We have initiated three trust preferred
security issuances since 2002 totaling $67.0 million, with one of those issuances for $20.6 million being redeemed in 2007. These
borrowings each have 30 year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as capital for regulatory
capital adequacy requirements. We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after
their issue date. We issued $20.6 million of this debt on October 29, 2002 (which we called in 2007), an additional $20.6 million
on December 19, 2003, and $25.8 million on April 13, 2006. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis
at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70% for the securities issued in 2003, and three-month LIBOR plus 1.39% for the securities
issued in 2006.
 
Liquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies
 
We have a pending agreement to purchase eleven
branches of another bank with approximately $180 million in total deposits and $98 million in total loans. See Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements for additional information.
 
Our liquidity is determined by our ability to
convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing
funds, and our ability to maintain required reserve levels, pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary
liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments.
Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash.
 
As noted above, in addition to internally generated
liquidity sources, we currently (March 2012) have the ability to obtain borrowings from the following four sources – 1) an
approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent
bank, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the FRB’s discount window and 4) a holding company line of credit
with a limit of $10 million.
 
Our overall liquidity increased slightly during
2011 compared to 2010. Our loans decreased by $24 million, while our deposits increased by $103 million. As a result, our liquid
assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to
15.7% at December 31, 2011.
 
We continue to believe our liquidity sources,
including unused lines of credit, are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable
future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity
if deemed appropriate.
 
In the normal course of business we have various
outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities,
such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows.
 
Table 18 reflects our contractual obligations
and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Any of our $88 million in outstanding borrowings with the
FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in our condition or
if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement.

In the normal course of business there are various
outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the financial
statements. The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December 31, 2011:

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we also had $7.1
million and $7.5 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. We had no carrying amount for these standby letters
of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a guarantee made on behalf of our customers
to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit are generally
for terms of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of the guarantees
would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The maximum potential
amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the
parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments
discussed above. In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already executed by the customer,
becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, we have had to honor only a few standby
letters of credit, which involved insignificant amounts of funds and have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any
loss to us. We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.
 
It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals
are generally replaced with new deposits, thus not requiring any net cash outflow. Based on that assumption, management believes
that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations.
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings that,
in management’s opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity
 
Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011
amounted to $345.2 million compared to $344.6 million at December 31, 2010. The two basic components that typically have the largest
impact on our shareholders’ equity are net income, which increases shareholders’ equity, and dividends declared, which
decreases shareholders’ equity. Additionally, any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders’ equity.
 
In 2011, the most significant factors that impacted
our equity were the redemption of $65.0 million of our Series A Preferred Stock issued under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital
Purchase Program (also known as TARP) and the simultaneous issuance of $63.5 million of Series B Preferred Stock under the Treasury’s
Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). Net income of $13.6 million for 2011 increased equity, while common stock dividends declared
of $5.4 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.2 million reduced equity. We also recorded accretion of the discount
on preferred stock of $2.9 million due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. (See Note 19 to the consolidated financial
statements for further information on these transactions.) Another significant factor negatively impacting equity in 2011 was a
$4.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss that was caused by an increase in our pension liability. The increase
in the pension liability was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on the actuarial calculations involved in determining
the liability. Our policy is to use the Citigroup Pension Index yield curve in the computation of the pension liability. At December
31, 2011, that index had a weighted average rate of 4.39%, which was a decline from the rate of 5.59% at December 31, 2010. See
the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other
less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity.
    59
    Table of Contents
    
  
In 2010, the most significant factors that impacted
our equity were net income of $10.0 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.4 million and preferred
stock dividends declared of $3.3 million, which reduced equity. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within
the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity.
 
In 2009, the most significant item that impacted
our equity was our issuance of $65 million in preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the
Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, other significant
factors were net income of $60.3 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.3 million and preferred
stock dividends declared of $3.2 million, which reduced equity. See the consolidated financial statements for other less significant
factors that impacted equity in 2009.
 
We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory
authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources,
or operations.
 
The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory
capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory,
and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of “Tier 1”
capital to total risk-weighted assets (“Tier I Capital Ratio”) and total capital to risk-weighted assets (“Total
Capital Ratio”) of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders’ equity, excluding
unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale, less intangible assets, and total capital is comprised of Tier
1 capital plus certain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted
assets refer to the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using
formulas set forth in FRB and FDIC regulations.
 
In addition to the risk-based capital requirements
described above, the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier
1 capital (as defined above) to quarterly average total assets (“Leverage Ratio) of 3.00% to 5.00%, depending upon the institution’s
composite ratings as determined by its regulators. The FRB has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to the
Company.
 
Table 21 presents our
regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded
the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report.
 
In addition to the minimum capital requirements
described above, the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank’s
classification as “well capitalized.” The specific guidelines are as follows – Tier I Capital Ratio of at least
6.00%, Total Capital Ratio of at least 10.00%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5.00%. If a bank falls below “well capitalized”
status in any of these three ratios, it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits. The
Bank’s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for “well-capitalized” status at December 31, 2011, 2010,
and 2009 – see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a table that presents the Bank’s regulatory ratios.
    60
    Table of Contents
    
  
In addition to shareholders’
equity, we have supplemented our capital in past years with trust preferred security debt issuances, which because of their structure
qualify as regulatory capital. This was necessary in past years because our balance sheet growth outpaced the growth rate
of our capital. Additionally, we have frequently purchased bank branches over the years that resulted in our recording intangible
assets, which negatively impacted regulatory capital ratios. As discussed in “Borrowings”
above, we have issued a total of $67.0 million in trust preferred securities since 2002, with the most recent issuance being a
$25.8 million issuance that occurred in April 2006. We currently have $46.4 million in trust preferred securities outstanding.
 
In this economic environment, our goal is to maintain
our capital ratios at levels at least 200 basis points higher than the “well-capitalized” thresholds set for banks.
At December 31, 2011, our total risk-based capital ratio was 16.72% compared to the 10.00% “well-capitalized” threshold.
 
In addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also
closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (“TCE Ratio”). Our TCE ratio was 6.58% at December
31, 2011 compared to 6.52% at December 31, 2010.
 
See “Supervision and Regulation” under
“Business” above and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect
our capital resources.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative
Financial Instruments
 
Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions,
agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated
entity. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated
with our trust preferred securities.
 
Derivative financial instruments include futures,
forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. We have not engaged
in derivatives activities through December 31, 2011 and have no current plans to do so.
 
Return on Assets and Equity
 
Table 20 shows return on assets (net income available
to common shareholders divided by average total assets), return on common equity (net income available to common shareholders divided
by average common shareholders’ equity), dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by net income per common share)
and shareholders’ equity to assets ratio (average total shareholders’ equity divided by average total assets) for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011.
 
Interest Rate Risk (Including Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Item 7A.)
 
Net interest income is our most significant component
of earnings. Notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits, our level of net interest income is continually at risk
due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to our
various categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It is our policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection, to the extent practical,
against wide interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using
standard GAP reports, maturity reports, and an asset/liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and
expense based on current interest rates, expected future interest rates, and various intervals of “shock” interest
rates. Over the years, we have been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets (net interest margin).
Over the past five calendar years, our net interest margin has ranged from a low of 3.74% (realized in 2008) to a high of 4.72%
(realized in 2011). During that five year period, the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of 3.25% (which was the rate
as of December 31, 2011) to a high of 8.25%. The consistency of the net interest margin is aided by the relatively low level of
long-term interest rate exposure that we maintain. At December 31, 2011, approximately 82% of our interest-earning assets are subject
to repricing within five years (because they are either adjustable rate assets or they are fixed rate assets that mature) and substantially
all of our interest-bearing liabilities reprice within five years.

Table 17 sets forth our interest rate sensitivity
analysis as of December 31, 2011, using stated maturities for all fixed rate instruments except mortgage-backed securities (which
are allocated in the periods of their expected payback) and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be
called (which are shown in the period of their expected call). As illustrated by this table, at December 31, 2011, we had $682
million more in interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets. This
generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and
would benefit from a declining interest rate environment. However, this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures
the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings, market value, or management actions. Also, interest rates
on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on
other types may lag behind changes in market rates. In addition to the effects of “when” various rate-sensitive products
reprice, market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products. For example, included in interest-bearing
liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at December 31, 2011 are deposits totaling $1.084 billion comprised
of NOW, savings, and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management. These types of deposits historically
have not repriced with, or in the same proportion, as general market indicators.
 
Overall we believe that in the near term (twelve
months), net interest income will not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates. Similarly, we
would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates. Generally, when rates change,
our interest-sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change, while our interest-sensitive
liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate
change. In the short-term (less than six months), this results in us being asset-sensitive, meaning that our net interest income
benefits from an increase in interest rates and is negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates. However, in the twelve-month
horizon, the impact of having a higher level of interest-sensitive liabilities lessens the short-term effects of changes in interest
rates.
 
The Federal Reserve
has made no changes to interest rates since 2008, and since that time the difference between market driven short-term interest
rates and longer-term interest rates has generally widened, with short-term interest rates steadily declining and longer term interest
rates not declining by as much. The higher long term interest rate environment enhanced our ability to require higher interest
rates on loans. As it relates to funding, we have been able to reprice many of our maturing time deposits at lower interest rates.
We were also able to generally decrease the rates we paid on other categories of deposits as a result of declining short-term
interest rates in the marketplace and an increase in liquidity that lessened our need to offer premium
interest rates. Our net interest margin increased throughout 2010 and 2011. Our net interest margin was 4.72% for 2011,
a 33 basis point increase from the 4.39% margin realized in 2010.
 
As previously discussed in the section “Net
Interest Income,” our net interest income was impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments related primarily to our
acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville. The purchase accounting adjustments related to the premium amortization
on loans, deposits and borrowings are based on amortization schedules and are thus systematic and predictable. The accretion of
the loan discount on loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, which amounted to $11.6 million and $7.6 million
for 2011 and 2010, respectively, is less predictable and could be materially different among periods. This is because of the magnitude
of the discounts that were initially recorded ($280 million in total) and the fact that the accretion being recorded is dependent
on both the credit quality of the acquired loans and the impact of any accelerated loan repayments, including payoffs. If the credit
quality of the loans declines, some, or all, of the remaining discount will cease to be accreted into income. If the underlying
loans experience accelerated paydowns or are paid off, the remaining discount will be accreted into income on an accelerated basis,
which in the event of total payoff will result in the remaining discount being entirely accreted into income in the period of the
payoff. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and susceptible to volatility.

Based on our most recent interest rate modeling,
which assumes no changes in interest rates for 2012 (federal funds rate = 0.25%, prime = 3.25%), we project that our net interest
margin for 2012 will remain relatively consistent with the net interest margins recently realized. With interest rates having been
stable for a relatively long period of time, most of our interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities have been
repriced at rates near today’s interest rates.
 
We have no market risk sensitive instruments held
for trading purposes, nor do we maintain any foreign currency positions. Table 19 presents the expected maturities of our other
than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments. Table 19 also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive
instruments as estimated in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Our assets and liabilities have estimated fair values
that do not materially differ from their carrying amounts.
 
See additional discussion regarding net interest
income, as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin, in the section entitled “Net Interest Income”
above.
 
Inflation
 
Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are
primarily monetary in nature (payable in fixed determinable amounts), the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in
interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, but the magnitude of the
change in rates may not be the same. The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those
businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding
increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general
increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses.
 
Current Accounting Matters
 
We prepare our consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”). Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic, the FASB frequently issues new rules
and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities. See Note 1(t) to our consolidated financial statements
for a discussion of recent rule proposals and changes.

(1)  Average loans include nonaccruing loans, the effect of which is to lower the average
rate shown. Interest earned includes recognized net loan fees (costs) in the amounts of ($101,500), $35,000, and $144,000 for
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
(2)  Includes accretion of discount on covered loans of $11,598,000, $7,607,000, and $1,469,000
in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. 
(3)  Includes tax-equivalent adjustments of $1,556,000, $1,316,000, and $818,000 in 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively, to reflect the federal and state tax benefit of the tax-exempt securities (using a 39% combined
tax rate), reduced by the related nondeductible portion of interest expense.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
(a) Basis of Presentation -
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Bancorp (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary - First
Bank (the Bank). The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries that are fully consolidated - First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (First
Bank Insurance) and First Troy SPE, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Subsequent
events have been evaluated through the date of filing this Form 10-K.
 
The Company is a bank holding company. The principal activity of
the Company is the ownership and operation of the Bank, a state chartered bank with its main office in Troy, North Carolina. The
Company is also the parent company for a series of statutory trusts that were formed at various times since 2002 for the purpose
of issuing trust preferred debt securities. The trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes; however, notes issued
by the Company to the trusts in return for the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities are included in the
consolidated financial statements and have terms that are substantially the same as the corresponding trust preferred securities.
The trust preferred securities qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. First Bank Insurance is an agent
for property and casualty insurance policies. First Troy SPE, LLC was formed in order to hold and dispose of certain real estate
foreclosed upon by the Bank.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates made by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are the determination
of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate, the accounting and impairment testing related to intangible
assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions.
 
(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents -
The Company considers all highly liquid assets such as cash on hand, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing amounts due from
banks and federal funds sold to be “cash equivalents.”
 
(c) Securities -
Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity”
and carried at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as “available for sale”
and carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being reported as other comprehensive income and reported as a separate
component of shareholders’ equity.
 
A decline in the market value of any available
for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount
to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Any equity security
that is in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months is presumed to be other than temporarily impaired and an impairment
charge is recorded unless the amount of the charge is insignificant.
Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized at the time
of sale based upon the specific identification method. Premiums and discounts are amortized into income on a level yield basis,
with premiums being amortized to the earliest call date and discounts being accreted to the stated maturity date.

(d) Premises and Equipment -
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation, computed by the straight-line method, is
charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the properties, which range from 2 to 40 years or, in the case of leasehold
improvements, over the term of the lease, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the year incurred. Gains
and losses on dispositions are included in current operations.
 
(e) Loans – Loans are stated at the principal amount
outstanding less any partial charge-offs plus deferred origination costs, net of nonrefundable loan fees. Interest on loans is
accrued on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Net deferred loan origination costs/fees are capitalized and recognized as
a yield adjustment over the life of the related loan.
 
The Company does not hold any interest-only strips, loans, other
receivables, or retained interests in securitizations that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that it would
not recover substantially all of its recorded investment.
 
Purchased loans acquired in a business combination, which include
loans that were purchased in the 2009 Cooperative Bank acquisition and the 2011 Bank of Asheville acquisition, are recorded at
estimated fair value on their purchase date. The purchaser cannot carry over any related allowance for loan losses.
 
The Company follows specific accounting guidance related to purchased
impaired loans when purchased loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition
that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. Evidence of credit quality deterioration
as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status. The accounting guidance permits the use
of the cost recovery method of income recognition for those purchased impaired loans for which the timing and amount of cash flows
expected to be collected cannot be reasonably estimated. Under the cost recovery method of income recognition, all cash receipts
are initially applied to principal, with interest income being recorded only after the carrying value of the loan has been reduced
to zero. Substantially all of the Company’s purchased impaired loans to date have had uncertain cash flows and thus are accounted
for under the cost recovery method of income recognition.
 
For nonimpaired purchased loans, the Company accretes any fair value
discount over the life of the loan in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.
 
A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s
judgment, the collection of interest appears doubtful. The accrual of interest is discontinued on all loans that become 90 days
or more past due with respect to principal or interest. The past due status of loans is based on the contractual payment terms.
While a loan is on nonaccrual status, the Company’s policy is that all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded
principal balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off.
Further cash receipts are recorded as interest income to the extent that any interest has been foregone. Loans are removed from
nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when concern no longer exists as to the collectability
of principal or interest. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to
provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms. The nonaccrual policy discussed above applies to all
loan classifications.

    Table of Contents
     
A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impaired loans are measured using either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that the Company expects to receive from the
borrower discounted at the loan’s effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the
collateral. Unless restructured, while a loan is considered to be impaired, the Company’s policy is that interest accrual
is discontinued and all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded principal balance has been reduced to zero, future
cash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off. Further cash receipts are recorded as interest income
to the extent that any interest has been foregone. Impaired loans that are restructured are returned to accruing status in accordance
with the restructured terms if the Company believes that the borrower will be able to meet the obligations of the restructured
loan terms. The impairment policy discussed above applies to all loan classifications.
 
(f) Presold Mortgages in Process of Settlement and Loans Held
for Sale - As a part of normal business operations, the Company originates residential
mortgage loans that have been pre-approved by secondary investors to be sold on a best efforts basis. The terms of the loans are
set by the secondary investors, and the purchase price that the investor will pay for the loan is agreed to prior to the funding
of the loan by the Company. Generally within three weeks after funding, the loans are transferred to the investor in accordance
with the agreed-upon terms. The Company records gains from the sale of these loans on the settlement date of the sale equal to
the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loan. The gain generally represents the portion of
the proceeds attributed to service release premiums received from the investors and the realization of origination fees received
from borrowers that were deferred as part of the carrying amount of the loan. Between the initial funding of the loans by the Company
and the subsequent reimbursement by the investors, the Company carries the loans on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or market.
 
Periodically, the Company originates commercial loans that are intended
for resale. The Company carries these loans at the lower of cost or fair value at each reporting date. There were no such loans
held for sale as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
 
(g) Allowance for Loan Losses -
The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged-off against
the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The provision for
loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based
on several factors, including:
 
     
    1.
    Risk grades assigned to the loans in the portfolio,
     
    2.
    Specific reserves for larger loans with concerns regarding repayment ability,
     
    3.
    Current economic conditions, including the local, state, and national economic outlook; interest rate risk; trends in loan volume, mix and size of loans; seasoning of the loan portfolio; levels and trends of delinquencies,
     
    4.
    Historical loan loss experience with the more recent periods carrying a higher weight, and
     
    5.
    An assessment of the risk characteristics of the Company’s loan portfolio, including industry concentrations, payment structures, and credit administration practices.
 
While management uses the best information available to make evaluations,
future adjustments may be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used.
 
For loans covered under loss share agreements, subsequent decreases
to the expected cash flows will generally result in additional provisions for loan losses. Subsequent increases in expected cash
flows will result in a reversal of the allowance for loan losses to the extent of prior allowance recognition.
 
In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to
recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgment about information available to them at the time of
their examinations.

(h) Other Real Estate -
Other real estate owned consists primarily of real estate acquired by the Company through legal foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure. The property is initially carried at the lower of cost (generally the loan balance plus additional costs incurred
for improvements to the property) or the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs. If there are subsequent
declines in fair value, which is reviewed routinely by management, the property is written down to its fair value through a charge
to expense. Capital expenditures made to improve the property are capitalized. Costs of holding real estate, such as property taxes,
insurance and maintenance, less related revenues during the holding period, are recorded as expense.
 
(i) FDIC Indemnification Asset – The FDIC indemnification
asset relates to loss share agreements with the FDIC, whereby the FDIC has agreed to reimburse to the Company a percentage of the
losses related to loans and other real estate that the Company assumed in the acquisition of two failed banks. This indemnification
asset is measured separately from the loan portfolio and other real estate because it is not contractually embedded in the loans
and is not transferable with the loans should the Company choose to dispose of them. The carrying value of this receivable at each
period end is the sum of:  1) actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been
received and 2) the Company’s estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied
by the FDIC reimbursement percentage.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of actual claims that had been submitted
to the FDIC for reimbursement but had not yet been received was $13.4 million and $30.2 million, respectively.
 
(j) Income Taxes -
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by the amount of such benefits that are
not expected to be realized based upon available evidence. The Company’s investment tax credits, which are low income housing
tax credits and state historic tax credits, are recorded in the period that they are reflected in the Company’s tax returns.
 
(k) Intangible Assets -
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized
separately and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which for the Company has generally been seven to ten years and
at an accelerated rate. Goodwill is recognized in business combinations to the extent that the price paid exceeds the fair value
of the net assets acquired, including any identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but as discussed in Note 1(p),
is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis.
 
(l) Other Investments – The Company accounts
for investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies (“LLCs”), and other privately held companies using
either the cost or the equity method of accounting. The accounting treatment depends upon the Company’s percentage ownership
and degree of management influence.
 
Under the cost method of accounting, the Company records an investment
in stock at cost and generally recognizes cash dividends received as income. If cash dividends received exceed the investee’s
earnings since the investment date, these payments are considered a return of investment and reduce the cost of the investment.
 
Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its initial
investment at cost. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to reflect the Company’s
share of income or loss of the investee. The Company’s recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment
is based on the Company’s ownership percentage in the investee and the investee’s earnings on a quarterly basis. The
investees generally provide their financial information during the quarter following the end of a given period. The Company’s
policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on equity method investments in the quarter the financial information is received.
 
    91
    Table of Contents
     
All of the Company’s investments in limited partnerships,
LLCs, and other companies are privately held, and their market values are not readily available. The Company’s management
evaluates its investments in investees for impairment based on the investee’s ability to generate cash through its operations
or obtain alternative financing, and other subjective factors. There are inherent risks associated with the Company’s investments
in such companies, which may result in income statement volatility in future periods.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s investments
in limited partnerships, LLCs and other privately held companies totaled $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and were
included in other assets.
 
(m) Stock Option Plan -
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four equity-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 15.
The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of relevant accounting guidance.
 
(n) Per Share Amounts -
Basic Earnings Per Common Share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted Earnings Per Common Share is computed by assuming the issuance of common
shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Currently, the Company’s potentially
dilutive common stock issuances relate to grants under the Company’s equity-based plans, including 1) stock options, 2) performance
units, and 3) restricted stock grants. In computing Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, it is assumed that all dilutive stock options
are exercised during the reporting period at their respective exercise prices, with the proceeds from the exercises used by the
Company to buy back stock in the open market at the average market price in effect during the reporting period. The difference
between the number of shares assumed to be exercised and the number of shares bought back is included in the calculation of dilutive
securities. Performance units vest if certain financial goals and service conditions are met. Once vested, one performance unit
is equal to one share of common stock. Performance units are included in the calculation of dilutive securities if the financial
goals for a measurement period have been met, even if service requirements have not been met. Restricted stock grants issued by
the Company vest solely on service conditions, and thus these shares are included in the calculation of dilutive securities.
 
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators
used in computing Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share:

For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were
396,669 options, 604,752 options and 704,018 options, respectively, that were anti-dilutive because the exercise price exceeded
the average market price for the year, and thus are not included in the calculation to determine the effect of dilutive securities.
In addition, the warrant for 616,308 shares issued to the Treasury in 2009 and repurchased by the Company in 2011 was anti-dilutive
for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 – see Note 19 for additional information.
 
(o) Fair Value of Financial Instruments -
Relevant accounting guidance requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value
methods and assumptions are set forth below for the Company’s financial instruments.
 
Cash and Amounts Due from Banks, Federal Funds Sold, Presold Mortgages
in Process of Settlement, Accrued Interest Receivable, and Accrued Interest Payable -
The carrying amounts approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.
 
Available for Sale and Held to Maturity Securities -
Fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.
 
Loans - Fair values are
estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, financial
and agricultural, real estate construction, real estate mortgages and installment loans to individuals. Each loan category is further
segmented into fixed and variable interest rate terms. The fair value for each category is determined by discounting scheduled
future cash flows using current interest rates offered on loans with similar risk characteristics. Fair values for impaired loans
are estimated based on discounted cash flows or underlying collateral values, where applicable.
 
FDIC Indemnification Asset – Fair value is equal to the FDIC
reimbursement rate of the expected losses to be incurred and reimbursed by the FDIC and then discounted over the estimated period
of receipt.
 
Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase -
The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest-bearing
demand deposits, savings, NOW, and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand as of the valuation date. The
fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated
using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
 
Borrowings - The fair value
of borrowings is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered by the Company’s lenders for debt of similar remaining maturities.
 
Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit -
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments had no carrying value. The large majority
of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are at variable rates and/or have relatively short terms to maturity.
Therefore, the fair value for these financial instruments is considered to be immaterial.
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates
are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various
financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
 
    93
    Table of Contents
     
 
Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities
include net premises and equipment, intangible and other assets such as foreclosed properties, deferred income taxes, prepaid expense
accounts, income taxes currently payable and other various accrued expenses. In addition, the income tax ramifications related
to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered
in any of the estimates.
 
(p) Impairment -
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their related
carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines whether the implied fair
value of the goodwill, using various valuation techniques, exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of
the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
 
The Company reviews all other long-lived assets, including identifiable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Company’s policy is that an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the asset. Any long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
value, less costs to sell.
 
To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment write-downs
of its long-lived assets or goodwill.
 
(q) Comprehensive Income -
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period for non-owner transactions and is divided into net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are excluded
from earnings under current accounting standards. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company
are as follows:

(r) Segment Reporting -
Accounting standards require management to report selected financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments.
The standards also require related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Generally, disclosures
are required for segments internally identified to evaluate performance and resource allocation. The Company’s operations
are primarily within the banking segment, and the financial statements presented herein reflect the results of that segment. The
Company has no foreign operations or customers.
 
(s) Reclassifications -
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect
on net income or shareholders’ equity as previously presented, nor did they materially impact trends in financial information.

(t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements -
In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires an
entity to provide more information about the credit quality of its financing receivables, such as aging information, credit quality
indicators and troubled debt restructurings, in the disclosures to its financial statements.  The disclosures must be disaggregated
by portfolio segment or class.  The disaggregation of information is based on how the entity develops its allowance for credit
losses and how it manages its credit exposure. Except for disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings (discussed in next
paragraph), the required disclosures became effective for periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The Company is required
to include these disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements. See Note 4 for required disclosures.
 
In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance to assist creditors with
their determination of when a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. The determination is based on whether the restructuring
constitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, as both events must be present. This guidance
and the new disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2011. See Note 4 for required disclosures.
 
In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to modify Step
1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity
is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
Any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption.
Impairments occurring subsequent to adoption should be included in earnings. The amendment was effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2011 and did not impact the Company.
 
In September 2011, the FASB issued additional amended guidance related
to goodwill impairment testing. Guidance now permits an entity to consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This amendment will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2012
and is not expected to impact the Company.
 
Also in December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance s pecifying
that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable
prior annual reporting period only. The amendment also requires that the supplemental pro forma disclosures include a description
of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination
included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This amendment is effective for the Company for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The Company does not expect this guidance
to have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In June 2011, the FASB amended the comprehensive income guidance
by eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity.
The amendment requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income and requires an entity
to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements.
In December 2011, the FASB deferred the effective date of presenting reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income
to net income on the face of the financial statements. The remaining amendments of the guidance will be applicable to the Company
on January 1, 2012 and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has consistently followed the new requirements in prior filings,
and thus this guidance will not change the way the Company has presented its financial statements.
 
Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 2. Acquisitions – Completed and Pending
 
The Company did not complete
any significant acquisitions during 2010. The Company completed the acquisitions described below during 2009 and 2011. The results
of each acquired company/branch are included in the Company’s results beginning on its respective acquisition date.
 
(1) On June 19, 2009, the Bank entered
into a purchase and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for Cooperative Bank,
in Wilmington, North Carolina. Earlier that day, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks issued an order requiring the closure
of Cooperative Bank and appointing the FDIC as receiver. According to the terms of the agreement, the Bank acquired all deposits
(except certain brokered deposits) and borrowings, and substantially all of the assets of Cooperative Bank and its subsidiary,
Lumina Mortgage. All deposits were assumed by the Bank with no losses to any depositor.
 
Cooperative Bank operated through twenty-one branches in North Carolina
and three branches in South Carolina, with assets totaling approximately $959 million and approximately 200 employees.
 
The loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two
loss share agreements between the FDIC and the Bank, which affords the Bank significant loss protection. Under the loss share agreements,
the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million and 95% of losses in excess of that
amount. The term for loss sharing on residential real estate loans is ten years, while the term for loss sharing on non-residential
real estate loans is five years in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries. The reimbursable losses from
the FDIC are based on the book value of the relevant loan as determined by the FDIC at the date of the transaction. New loans made
after that date are not covered by the loss share agreements.
 
The Bank received a $123 million discount on the assets acquired
and paid no deposit premium. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with relevant
accounting guidance. The purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values,
and identifiable intangible assets were recorded at fair value. Fair values were subject to refinement for up to one year after
the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values became available. The Company recorded
an estimated receivable from the FDIC in the amount of $185.1 million as of June 30, 2009, which represented the FDIC’s portion
of the losses that were expected to be incurred and reimbursed to the Company.
 
An acquisition gain totaling $67.9 million resulted from the acquisition
and is included as a component of noninterest income in the Company’s statement of income. In the Company’s filings
for the second quarter 2009, this gain was reported as being $53.8 million. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company
obtained third-party appraisals for the majority of Cooperative Bank’s collateral dependent problem loans. Overall, the appraised
values were higher than the Company’s original estimates made as of the acquisition date. In addition, during the third and
fourth quarters of 2009, the Company received payoffs related to certain loans for which losses had been anticipated. Accordingly,
as required by accounting guidance, the Company retrospectively adjusted the fair value of the loans acquired for these factors,
which resulted in a higher gain being reflected in the second quarter of 2009.

Explanation of Fair Value Adjustments
 
     
    (a)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was necessary as of the acquisition date to write down Cooperative Bank’s book value of loans to the estimated fair value as a result of future expected loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (b)
    This estimated fair value adjustment represents the value of the core deposit base assumed in the acquisition based on a study performed by an independent consulting firm.  This amount was recorded by the Company as an identifiable intangible asset and will be amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average life of the core deposit base, which is estimated to be 8 years.
     
     
     
     
    (c)
    This estimated fair value adjustment represents the amount that the Company will receive from the FDIC under its loss share agreements as a result of future loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (d)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was necessary to write down Cooperative Bank’s book value of foreclosed real estate properties to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.
     
     
     
     
    (e)
    These estimated fair value adjustments are other immaterial adjustments made to acquired assets and assumed liabilities to reflect fair value.
     
     
     
     
    (f)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was recorded because the weighted average interest rate of Cooperative Bank’s time deposits exceeded the cost of similar wholesale funding at the time of the acquisition.  This amount was amortized to reduce interest expense on a declining basis over the average life of the portfolio of approximately 15 months.
     
     
     
     
    (g)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was recorded because the interest rates of Cooperative Bank’s fixed rate borrowings exceeded current interest rates on similar borrowings.  This amount was realized shortly after the acquisition by prepaying the borrowings at a premium, and thus there will be no future amortization related to this adjustment.

The operating results of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2009 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities since the acquisition date of June 19, 2009.
 
(2) On January 21, 2011, the Bank entered into
a loss share purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC, as receiver for The Bank of Asheville, Asheville, North Carolina.
Earlier that day, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks issued an order for the closure of The Bank of Asheville and appointed
the FDIC as receiver. According to the terms of the agreement, First Bank acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities
of The Bank of Asheville. All deposits were assumed by First Bank with no losses to any depositor.
 
The Bank of Asheville operated through five branches in Asheville,
North Carolina with total assets of approximately $198 million and 50 employees.
 
Substantially all of the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased
are covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and First Bank, which afford First Bank significant loss protection. Under
the loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses. The term for loss sharing
on residential real estate loans is ten years, while the term for loss sharing on non-residential real estate loans is five years
in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries. The reimbursable losses from the FDIC are based on the book
value of the relevant loan as determined by the FDIC at the date of the transaction. New loans made after that date are not covered
by the loss share agreements.
 
First Bank received a $23.9 million discount on the assets acquired
and paid no deposit premium. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with relevant
accounting guidance. The statement of net assets acquired as of January 21, 2011 and the resulting gain are presented in the following
table. The purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values, and identifiable
intangible assets were recorded at fair value. The Company recorded an estimated receivable from the FDIC in the amount of $42.2
million, which represents the fair value of the FDIC’s portion of the losses that are expected to be incurred and reimbursed
to the Company.
 
An acquisition gain totaling $10.2 million resulted from the acquisition
and is included as a component of noninterest income in the statement of income. The amount of the gain is equal to the amount
by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed.

Explanation of Fair Value Adjustments
 
     
    (a)
    This estimated adjustment is necessary as of the acquisition date to write down The Bank of Asheville’s book value of loans to the estimated fair value as a result of future expected loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (b)
    This fair value adjustment represents the value of the core deposit base assumed in the acquisition based on a study performed by an independent consulting firm.  This amount was recorded by the Company as an identifiable intangible asset and will be amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average life of the core deposit base, which is estimated to be seven years.
     
     
     
     
    (c)
    This adjustment is the estimated fair value of the amount that the Company expects to receive from the FDIC under its loss share agreements as a result of future loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (d)
    This is the estimated adjustment necessary to write down The Bank of Asheville’s book value of foreclosed real estate properties to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.
     
     
     
     
    (e)
    This is an immaterial adjustment made to reflect fair value.
     
     
     
     
    (f)
    This fair value adjustment was recorded because the weighted average interest rate of The Bank of Asheville’s time deposits exceeded the cost of similar wholesale funding at the time of the acquisition.  This amount will be amortized to reduce interest expense on a declining basis over the life of the portfolio of approximately 48 months.
     
     
     
     
    (g)
    This fair value adjustment was recorded because the interest rates of The Bank of Asheville’s fixed rate borrowings exceeded current interest rates on similar borrowings.  This amount was realized shortly after the acquisition by prepaying the borrowings at a premium and thus there will be no future amortization related to this adjustment.
     
     
     
     
    (h)
    This adjustment relates primarily to the estimate of what the Company will owe to the FDIC at the conclusion of the loss share agreements based on a pre-established formula set forth in those agreements that is based on total expected losses in relation to the amount of the discount bid.

The operating results of the Company for the year
ended December 31, 2011 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for the period subsequent
to the acquisition date of January 21, 2011. Due primarily to the significant amount of fair value adjustments and the FDIC loss
share agreements now in place, historical results of The Bank of Asheville are not believed to be relevant to the Company’s
results, and thus no pro forma information is presented.
 
(3) At December 31, 2011, the Company had one
pending acquisition. On October 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement (“The Agreement”)
with Waccamaw Bankshares, Inc., and its subsidiary, Waccamaw Bank. The Agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches
from Waccamaw Bank, which includes assuming all deposits, selected performing loans, and all premises and equipment. Deposits total
approximately $180 million (unaudited) and loans total approximately $98 million (unaudited).
 
The Agreement provides for the deposits to be purchased at a premium
that varies by account type. The estimated blended premium is approximately 1.5% of total deposits (unaudited).
 
The Agreement provides for loans to be purchased at par (the amount
of principal outstanding and interest receivable) and for premises and equipment to be purchased at net book value. Approximately
$31 million of the $98 million (unaudited) in loans being acquired are subject to a provision in the Agreement allowing First Bank
to put the loans back to Waccamaw Bank at par value for any reason within 20 months following the closing date of the transaction.
The Agreement is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. No assurance can be provided that this Agreement
will be approved.

In the above tables, all of the non-equity securities that were
in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are bonds that the Company has determined are in a loss position due
to interest rate factors, the overall economic downturn in the financial sector, and the broader economy in general. The Company
has evaluated the collectability of each of these bonds and has concluded that there is no other-than-temporary impairment. The
Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell
these securities before recovery of the amortized cost.
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company’s $12.5 million investment
in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:

The Company has concluded that each of the equity securities in
an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was in such a position due to temporary fluctuations in the market prices
of the securities. The Company’s policy is to record an impairment charge for any of these equity securities that remains
in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months unless the amount is insignificant.
 
The aggregate carrying amount of cost-method investments was $11,368,000
and $14,766,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included the Federal Home Loan Bank stock discussed above. The
Company determined that none of its cost-method investments were impaired at either year end.
 
The book values and approximate fair values of investment securities
at December 31, 2011, by contractual maturity, are summarized in the table below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, investment securities with book values
of $47,418,000 and $75,654,000, respectively, were pledged as collateral for public and private deposits and securities sold under
agreements to repurchase.
 
There were $2,510,000 in sales of securities in 2011, which resulted
in a net gain of $8,000. There were no sales of securities in 2010. There were $44,000 in sales in 2009, which resulted in a net
gain of $9,000. In 2011, the Company recorded a net loss of $5,000 related to write-downs of the Company’s equity portfolio
and recorded a net gain of $71,000 related to the call of several securities. In 2010, the Company recorded a gain of $26,000 related
to the call of several municipal securities. The Company recorded losses of $113,000 related to write-downs of the Company’s
equity portfolio in 2009.
 
Note 4. Loans and Asset Quality Information
 
The loans and foreclosed real estate that were acquired in FDIC-assisted
transactions are covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and the Company’s banking subsidiary, First Bank, which
afford First Bank significant loss protection. (See Note 2 above for more information regarding these transactions.) Because of
the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans and foreclosed real
estate are significantly different from those assets not covered under the loss share agreements. Accordingly, the Company presents
separately loans subject to the loss share agreements as “covered loans” in the information below and loans that are
not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered loans.”

As of December 31, 2011 and
2010, net loans include an unamortized premium of $949,000 and $687,000, respectively, related to acquired loans.
 
Loans in the amounts of $2,074,148,000 and $1,708,642,000 as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are pledged as collateral for certain borrowings (see Note 10).
 
The loans above also include loans to executive officers and directors
serving the Company at December 31, 2011 and to their associates, totaling approximately $6,004,000 and $5,097,000 at December
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, additions to such loans were approximately $1,253,000 and repayments totaled approximately
$346,000. These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other non-related borrowers. Management does not believe these loans involve more than
the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

As reflected in the table above, the Company accreted $11,598,000
and $7,607,000 of the loan discount on purchased nonimpaired loans into interest income during 2011 and 2010, respectively. As
of December 31, 2011, there was remaining loan discount of $89,837,000 related to purchased nonimpaired loans. If these loans continue
to be repaid by the borrowers, the Company will accrete the remaining loan discount into interest income over the lives of the
respective loans. In such circumstances, a corresponding entry to reduce the indemnification asset will be recorded amounting to
80% of the loan discount accretion, which reduces noninterest income.
 
The following table presents information regarding all purchased
impaired loans since December 31, 2009, substantially all of which are covered loans. The Company has applied the cost recovery
method to all purchased impaired loans at their respective acquisition dates due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected
cash flows, as reflected in the following table.

Each of the purchased impaired loans are on nonaccrual status and
considered to be impaired. Because of the uncertainty of the expected cash flows, the Company is accounting for each purchased
impaired loan under the cost recovery method, in which all cash payments are applied to principal. Thus, there is no accretable
yield associated with the above loans. During 2011 and 2010, the Company received $0 and $67,000, respectively, in payments that
exceeded the initial carrying amount of the purchased impaired loans, which is included in the loan discount accretion amount discussed
previously.

(1) At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the contractual
balance of the nonaccrual loans covered by FDIC loss share agreements was $69.0 million and $86.2 million, respectively.
 
If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2011,
2010, and 2009 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since
origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $8,724,000, $8,136,000 and $9,800,000
for nonaccrual loans and $1,873,000, $1,943,000 and $1,200,000 for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2011, 2010, and
2009 amounted to approximately $2,578,000, $3,195,000 and $2,147,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual
status), and $1,351,000, $1,342,000, and $866,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company
had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.

 All of the impaired loans noted in the table above were on
nonaccrual status at each respective period end except for those classified as restructured loans (see table on previous page
for balances).
 
The remaining tables in this note present information derived from
the Company’s allowance for loan loss model. Relevant accounting guidance requires certain disclosures to be disaggregated
based on how the Company develops its allowance for loan losses and manages its credit exposure. This model combines loan types
in a different manner than the tables previously presented.

The Company tracks credit quality based on its internal risk ratings.
Upon origination a loan is assigned an initial risk grade, which is generally based on several factors such as the borrower’s
credit score, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt-to-income ratio, etc. Loans that are risk-graded as substandard during the origination
process are declined. After loans are initially graded, they are monitored monthly for credit quality based on many factors, such
as payment history, the borrower’s financial status, and changes in collateral value. Loans can be downgraded or upgraded
depending on management’s evaluation of these factors. Internal risk-grading policies are consistent throughout each loan
type.
 
The following describes the Company’s internal risk grades
in ascending order of likelihood of loss:
 
     
    Numerical Risk Grade
    Description
    Pass:
     
     
    1
    Cash secured loans.
     
    2
    Non-cash secured loans that have no minor or major exceptions to the lending guidelines.
     
    3
    Non-cash secured loans that have no major exceptions to the lending guidelines.
    Weak Pass:
     
     
    4
    Non-cash secured loans that have minor or major exceptions to the lending guidelines, but the exceptions are properly mitigated.
    Watch or Standard:
     
     
    9
    Loans that meet the guidelines for a Risk Graded 5 loan, except the collateral coverage is sufficient to satisfy the debt with no risk of loss under reasonable circumstances.  This category also includes all loans to insiders and any other loan that management elects to monitor on the watch list.
    Special Mention:
     
     
    5
    Existing loans with major exceptions that cannot be mitigated.
    Classified:
     
     
    6
    Loans that have a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt if deficiencies are not corrected.
     
    7
    Loans that have a well-defined weakness that make the collection or liquidation improbable.
     
    8
    Loans that are considered uncollectible and are in the process of being charged-off.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
 
The restructuring of a loan is considered a “troubled debt
restructuring” if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the creditor has granted a concession.
Concessions may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization
schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.
 
The vast majority of the Company’s troubled debt restructurings
modified during the year ended December 31, 2011 related to interest rate reductions combined with restructured amortization schedules.
The Company does not grant principal forgiveness.
 
All loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are considered
to be impaired and are evaluated as such for determination of the allowance for loan losses. The Company’s troubled debt
restructurings can be classified as either nonaccrual or accruing based on the loan’s payment status. The troubled debt restructurings
that are nonaccrual are reported within the nonaccrual loan totals presented previously.

Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
The following is a summary of the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization of amortized intangible assets as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the carrying amount of unamortized
intangible assets as of those same dates. In 2011, the Company recorded a core deposit premium intangible of $277,000 in connection
with the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the
related deposits of seven years.

A portion of the annual change in the net
deferred tax asset relates to unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale. The related 2011 and 2010 deferred
tax expense (benefit) of approximately $554,000 and $251,000 respectively, has been recorded directly to shareholders’ equity.
Additionally, a portion of the annual change in the net deferred tax asset relates to pension adjustments. The related 2011 and
2010 deferred tax expense (benefit) of ($2,912,000) and ($688,000), respectively, has been recorded directly to shareholders’
equity. Purchase acquisitions also increased the net deferred tax asset by approximately $4,005,000 in 2011. The balance of the
2011 increase in the net deferred tax asset of $3,928,000 is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit, and the balance of the
2010 increase in the net deferred tax asset of $24,200,000 is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit in the consolidated statement
of income.
 
The valuation allowances for 2011 and 2010
relate primarily to state net operating loss carryforwards. It is management’s belief that the realization of the remaining
net deferred tax assets is more likely than not.
 
The Company had no significant uncertain
tax positions, and thus no reserve for uncertain tax positions has been recorded. Additionally, the Company determined that it
has no material unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. The Company’s general policy
is to record tax penalties and interest as a component of “other operating expenses”.
 
The Company’s tax returns are subject
to income tax audit by federal and state agencies beginning with the year 2008.
 
Retained earnings at December 31, 2011
and 2010 includes approximately $6,869,000 representing pre-1988 tax bad debt reserve base year amounts for which no deferred income
tax liability has been provided since these reserves are not expected to reverse or may never reverse. Circumstances that would
require an accrual of a portion or all of this unrecorded tax liability are a reduction in qualifying loan levels relative to the
end of 1987, failure to meet the definition of a bank, dividend payments in excess of accumulated tax earnings and profits, or
other distributions in dissolution, liquidation or redemption of the Bank’s stock.

For the years ended December
31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company recorded amortization of deposit premiums amounting to $337,000, $2,211,000 and $3,911,000,
respectively, which reduced interest expense. The deposit premiums related to the Company’s acquisitions are discussed in
Note 2. The Company has $123,000 remaining in unamortized deposit premiums at December 31, 2011.
 
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent short-term
borrowings by the Company with maturities less than one year and are collateralized by a portion of the Company’s securities
portfolio, which have been delivered to a third-party custodian for safekeeping. At December 31, 2011, securities with an amortized
cost of $17,184,000 and a market value of $17,155,000 were pledged to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

As noted in the table above,
at December 31, 2011 and 2010, borrowings outstanding included $31,000 and $176,000, respectively, in unamortized premium on borrowings
acquired from a 2008 acquisition. The originally recorded premium was $1,328,000, of which $145,000, $341,000, and $464,000 was
amortized in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, as a reduction of interest expense.
 
All outstanding FHLB borrowings may be accelerated immediately by
the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in the condition of the Company or if the Company’s
qualifying collateral amounts to less than that required under the terms of the FHLB borrowing agreement.
 
In the above tables, the $20.6 million in borrowings due on January
23, 2034 relate to borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities that were issued by First Bancorp Capital Trusts
II and III ($10.3 million by each trust), which are unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Company, on December 19, 2003 and qualify
as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. These unsecured debt securities are callable by the Company at par on
any quarterly interest payment date beginning on January 23, 2009. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly
basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70%. The Company incurred approximately $580,000 of debt issuance costs related to
the issuance that were recorded as prepaid expenses and are included in the “Other Assets” line item of the consolidated
balance sheet. These debt issuance costs were amortized as interest expense until the earliest possible call date of January 23,
2009.

    Table of Contents
      
In the above tables, the $25.8 million in borrowings due on June
15, 2036 relate to borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities that were issued by First Bancorp Capital Trust
IV, an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, on April 13, 2006 and qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.
These unsecured debt securities are callable by the Company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on June 15,
2011. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.39%. The Company
incurred no debt issuance costs related to the issuance.
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four sources of readily available
borrowing capacity – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, of which $88 million was outstanding
at December 31, 2011 and $62 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit
with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $33 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010,
3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s (FRB) discount window, of which
none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $55 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4) a $10 million holding company
line of credit with a commercial bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
 
The Company’s line of credit with the FHLB totaling approximately
$389 million can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity needs
and is secured by the Company’s FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of its real estate loan portfolio. In addition to the
outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, the borrowing capacity
was further reduced by $203 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of the Company pledging letters of credit for public
deposits at each of those dates. Accordingly, the Company’s unused FHLB line of credit was $98 million at December 31, 2011.
 
The Company’s correspondent bank relationship allows the Company
to purchase up to $50 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). The Company had no borrowings
outstanding under this line at December 31, 2011 and $33 million in borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010.
 
The Company has a line of credit with the FRB discount window. This
line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the Company’s commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate).
Based on the collateral owned by the Company as of December 31, 2011, the available line of credit was approximately $79 million.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2011 and $55 million in borrowings outstanding
at December 31, 2010.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a $10 million line
of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by 100% of the common stock of the Bank. This line of credit expires and is
subject to renewal in March of each year. The line of credit was not drawn at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
 
Note 11. Leases
 
Certain bank premises are leased under operating lease agreements.
Generally, operating leases contain renewal options on substantially the same basis as current rental terms. Rent expense charged
to operations under all operating lease agreements was $1,226,000 in 2011, $2,076,000 in 2010, and $1,978,000 in 2009.

Note 12. Employee Benefit Plans
 
401(k) Plan . The Company sponsors a retirement savings plan
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who have completed one year of service are eligible to participate
in the plan. New employees, who have met the service requirement, are automatically enrolled in the plan at a 2% deferral rate,
which can be modified by the employee at any time. An eligible employee may contribute up to 15% of annual salary to the plan.
The Company contributes an amount equal to 75% of the first 6% of the employee’s salary contributed. Participants vest in
Company contributions at the rate of 20% after one year of service, and 20% for each additional year of service, with 100% vesting
after five years of service. The Company’s matching contribution expense was $1,198,000, $1,107,000, and $933,000, for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Additionally, the Company made additional discretionary matching contributions
to the plan of $200,000 in 2009. The Company did not make a discretionary contribution in 2011 or 2010. The Company’s matching
and discretionary contributions are made in the form of Company stock, which can be transferred by the employee into other investment
options offered by the plan at any time. Employees are not permitted to invest their own contributions in Company stock.
 
Pension Plan . The Company sponsors a noncontributory defined
benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”), which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Employees who have attained age 21 and completed one year of service are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. The
Pension Plan provides for a monthly payment, at normal retirement age of 65, equal to one-twelfth of the sum of (i) 0.75% of Final
Average Annual Compensation (5 highest consecutive calendar years’ earnings out of the last 10 years of employment) multiplied
by the employee’s years of service not in excess of 40 years, and (ii) 0.65% of Final Average Annual Compensation in excess
of “covered compensation” multiplied by years of service not in excess of 35 years. “Covered compensation”
means the average of the social security taxable wage base during the 35 year period ending with the year the employee attains
social security retirement age. Early retirement, with reduced monthly benefits, is available at age 55 after 15 years of service.
The Pension Plan provides for 100% vesting after 5 years of service, and provides for a death benefit to a vested participant’s
surviving spouse. The costs of benefits under the Pension Plan, which are borne by the Company, are computed actuarially and defrayed
by earnings from the Pension Plan’s investments. The compensation covered by the Pension Plan includes total earnings before
reduction for contributions to a cash or deferred profit-sharing plan (such as the 401(k) plan described above) and amounts used
to pay group health insurance premiums and includes bonuses (such as amounts paid under the incentive compensation plan). Compensation
for the purposes of the Pension Plan may not exceed statutory limits; such limits were $245,000 in 2011, $245,000 in 2010 and $235,000
in 2009.
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company amended the Pension
Plan to prohibit new entrants into the plan.

    Table of Contents
      
The Company’s contributions to the Pension Plan are based
on computations by independent actuarial consultants and are intended to provide the Company with the maximum deduction for income
tax purposes. The contributions are invested to provide for benefits under the Pension Plan. The Company expects that it will contribute
$2,500,000 to the Pension Plan in 2012.
 
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances
of the Pension Plan’s benefit obligation, as computed by the Company’s independent actuarial consultants, and its plan
assets, with the difference between the two amounts representing the funded status of the Pension Plan as of the end of the respective
year.

For each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the
Company used an expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption of 7.75%. The Company arrived at this rate based primarily
on a third-party investment consulting firm’s historical analysis of investment returns, which indicated that the mix of
the Pension Plan’s assets (generally 75% equities and 25% fixed income) can be expected to return approximately 7.75% on
a long term basis.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
  
     
    -
    Money market fund: valued on the active market on which it is traded; at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . The Company sponsors
a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”) for the benefit of certain senior management executives of the
Company. The purpose of the SERP is to provide additional monthly pension benefits to ensure that each such senior management executive
would receive lifetime monthly pension benefits equal to 3% of his or her final average compensation multiplied by his or her years
of service (maximum of 20 years) to the Company or its subsidiaries, subject to a maximum of 60% of his or her final average compensation.
The amount of a participant’s monthly SERP benefit is reduced by (i) the amount payable under the Company’s qualified
Pension Plan (described above), and (ii) 50% of the participant’s primary social security benefit. Final average compensation
means the average of the 5 highest consecutive calendar years of earnings during the last 10 years of service prior to termination
of employment. The SERP is an unfunded plan. Payments are made from the general assets of the Company.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $7.1 million and
$7.5 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. The Company has no carrying amount for these standby letters
of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf of the Company’s
customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit
are generally for terms for one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of
the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The
maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) the Company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event
of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount
of the standby letter of credit. In the event that the Company is required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already
executed with the customer, is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, the Company
has had to honor several insignificant standby letters of credit, which have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any
loss to the Company. Management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.
 
The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings which, in management’s
opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
The Bank grants primarily commercial
and installment loans to customers throughout its market area, which consists of Anson, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Buncombe,
Cabarrus, Carteret, Chatham, Columbus, Dare, Davidson, Duplin, Guilford, Harnett, Iredell, Lee, Montgomery, Moore, New Hanover,
Onslow, Randolph, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rowan, Scotland, Stanly and Wake Counties in North Carolina, Chesterfield, Dillon,
Florence and Horry Counties in South Carolina, and Montgomery, Pulaski, Washington and Wythe Counties in Virginia. The real estate
loan portfolio can be affected by the condition of the local real estate market. The commercial and installment loan portfolios
can be affected by local economic conditions.
 
The Company’s loan portfolio is not concentrated in loans
to any single borrower or to a relatively small number of borrowers. Additionally, management is not aware of any concentrations
of loans to classes of borrowers or industries that would be similarly affected by economic conditions.

    Table of Contents
      
In addition to monitoring potential concentrations of loans to particular
borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries and geographic regions, the Company monitors exposure to credit risk that could arise
from potential concentrations of lending products and practices such as loans that subject borrowers to substantial payment increases
(e.g. principal deferral periods, loans with initial interest-only periods, etc), and loans with high loan-to-value ratios. Additionally,
there are industry practices that could subject the Company to increased credit risk should economic conditions change over the
course of a loan’s life. For example, the Company makes variable rate loans and fixed rate principal-amortizing loans with
maturities prior to the loan being fully paid (i.e. balloon payment loans). These loans are underwritten and monitored to manage
the associated risks. The Company has determined that there is no concentration of credit risk associated with its lending policies
or practices.
 
The Company’s investment portfolio consists principally of
obligations of government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, corporate
bonds, FHLB stock and general obligation municipal securities. The following are the fair values at December 31, 2011 of available
for sale and held to maturity securities to any one issuer/guarantor that exceed $2.0 million, with such amounts representing the
maximum amount of credit risk that the Company would incur if the issuer did not repay the obligation.

Until February 27, 2009, the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as
borrowings were repaid. On February 27, 2009, the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when
loans are repaid. Instead, they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis. During
the second half of 2010, the FHLB repurchased $1.8 million of stock from the Company. During 2011, the FHLB repurchased $4.4 million
of stock from the Company.
 
The Company places its deposits and correspondent accounts with
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Bank, and Bank of America and sells its federal funds to Bank of America.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had deposits in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta totaling $17.6 million, deposits of $117.6
million in the Federal Reserve Bank, and deposits of $54.9 million in Bank of America and federal funds sold to Bank of America
of $0.6 million. None of the deposits held at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Bank, or the federal funds
sold to Bank of America are FDIC-insured, however the Federal Reserve Bank is a government entity and therefore risk of loss is
minimal. The deposits held at Bank of America are fully guaranteed by the FDIC under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
which guarantees, until December 31, 2013, an unlimited amount of non-interest bearing deposits.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company’s financial instruments, fair value estimates
are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various
financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
 
Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities
include net premises and equipment, intangible and other assets such as foreclosed properties, deferred income taxes, prepaid expense
accounts, income taxes currently payable and other various accrued expenses. In addition, the income tax ramifications related
to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered
in any of the estimates.
 
Relevant accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value. The guidance describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
 
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) of identical assets
or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
 
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active
or non-active markets and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
 
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect
a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
for instruments measured at fair value.
 
Securities — When quoted market prices are available
in an active market, the securities are classified as Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities for the Company include
certain equity securities. If quoted market prices are not available, but fair values can be estimated by observing quoted prices
of securities with similar characteristics, the securities are classified as Level 2 on the valuation hierarchy.  For
the Company, Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, government-sponsored entity
securities, and corporate bonds. In cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not available, securities are classified within Level
3 of the hierarchy.
 
 
    136
    Table of Contents
      
Impaired loans — Fair values for impaired loans
in the above table are collateral dependent and are estimated based on underlying collateral values, which are then adjusted for
the cost related to liquidation of the collateral.
 
Other real estate – Other real estate, consisting
of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, is reported at the lower of cost or fair value, determined
on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources,
adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real
estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses.
 
There were no transfers to or from Level 1 and 2 during the year
ended December 31, 2011.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in the fair value
of securities available for sale was $1,418,000, which is included in other comprehensive income (net of taxes of $554,000). For
the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in the fair value of securities available for sale was $646,000, which is included
in other comprehensive income (net of taxes of $251,000). Fair value measurement methods at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are consistent
with those used in prior reporting periods.
 
Note 15. Equity-Based Compensation Plans
  
At December 31, 2011, the Company had the following equity-based
compensation plans: the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan, the First Bancorp 2004 Stock Option Plan, the First Bancorp 1994 Stock
Option Plan, and one plan that was assumed from an acquired entity. The Company’s shareholders approved all equity-based
compensation plans, except for those assumed from acquired companies. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan became effective upon
the approval of shareholders on May 2, 2007. As of December 31, 2011, the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan was the only plan that
had shares available for future grants.
 
The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan is intended to serve as a means
to attract, retain and motivate key employees and directors and to associate the interests of the plans’ participants with
those of the Company and its shareholders. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan allows for both grants of stock options and other
types of equity-based compensation, including stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted performance stock, unrestricted
stock, and performance units.
  
Prior to the June 17, 2008 grant (discussed below), stock option
grants to employees generally had five-year vesting schedules (20% vesting each year) and had been irregular, usually falling into
three categories - 1) to attract and retain new employees, 2) to recognize changes in responsibilities of existing employees, and
3) to periodically reward exemplary performance. Compensation expense associated with these types of grants is recorded pro-ratably
over the vesting period. As it relates to directors, until 2010 the Company had historically granted 2,250 vested stock options
to each of the Company’s non-employee directors in June of each year. In June 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 1,414 common
shares and 1,039 common shares, respectively, to each non-employee director, which had approximately the same value as 2,250 stock
options. Compensation expense associated with these director grants is recognized on the date of grant since there are no vesting
conditions.
 
The June 17, 2008 grant of a combination of performance units and
stock options have both performance conditions (earnings per share targets) and service conditions that must be met in order to
vest. The 262,599 stock options and 81,337 performance units represented the maximum number of options and performance units that
could have vested if the Company were to achieve specified maximum goals for earnings per share during the three annual performance
periods ending on December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Up to one-third of the total number of options and performance units granted
were subject to vesting annually as of December 31 of each year beginning in 2010, if (1) the Company achieved specific earnings
per share (EPS) goals during the corresponding performance period and (2) the executive or key employee continued employment for
a period of two years beyond the corresponding performance period. Compensation expense for this grant was recorded over the various
service periods based on the estimated number of options and performance units that were probable to vest. No compensation cost
is recognized for awards that do not vest and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. The Company did not
achieve the minimum earnings per share performance goal for 2008 or 2010, and thus two-thirds of the above grant was permanently
forfeited. As a result of the significant acquisition gain realized in June 2009 related to a failed bank acquisition, the Company
achieved the EPS goal for 2009 and the related awards fully vested on December 31, 2011 for each grantee that remained employed
through that date. The Company recorded compensation expense of $299,000 in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011 related to the vesting
of these awards.
 
 
    137
    Table of Contents
     
The Company granted long-term restricted shares of common stock
to senior executives on December 11, 2009 and February 24, 2011, with vesting terms in accordance with the minimum rules for long-term
equity grants for companies participating in the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). These rules require
that the vesting of the stock be tied to repayment of the financial assistance, with a two year minimum vesting period. The Company
originally projected the repayment to occur five years after the date of the TARP issuance, and thus the amortization schedule
for the expense was based on a repayment date of January 9, 2014. However, the Company redeemed 100% of the TARP preferred stock
on September 1, 2011. Therefore, the Company recast the amortization schedule for both grants to be based on the vesting date two
years after the grant. The total compensation expense associated with the December 11, 2009 grant was $398,000 and was being initially
amortized over a four-year period at approximately $100,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2009 grant fully vested on
December 11, 2011. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $298,000 for 2011. The
total compensation expense associated with the February 24, 2011 grant was $105,500 and was being initially amortized over a three-year
period at approximately $35,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2011 grant will fully vest on February 24, 2013. Accordingly,
the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $42,000 in 2011. See Note 19 for further information related
to the Company’s participation in the TARP.
 
Under the terms of the Predecessor Plans and the First Bancorp 2007
Equity Plan, options can have a term of no longer than ten years, and all options granted thus far under these plans have had a
term of ten years. The Company’s options provide for immediate vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the
plans).
 
At December 31, 2011, there were 489,062 options outstanding related
to the three First Bancorp plans, with exercise prices ranging from $14.35 to $22.12. At December 31, 2011, there were 906,268
shares remaining available for grant under the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan. The Company also has a stock option plan as a result
of a corporate acquisition. At December 31, 2011, there were 4,788 stock options outstanding in connection with the acquired plan,
with option prices ranging from $10.66 to $15.22.
 
The Company issues new shares of common stock when options are exercised.
 
The Company measures the fair value of each option award on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company determines the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option
pricing model as follows: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant;
the dividend yield is based on the Company’s dividend yield at the time of the grant (subject to adjustment if the dividend
yield on the grant date is not expected to approximate the dividend yield over the expected life of the option); the volatility
factor is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock (subject to adjustment if future volatility is reasonably
expected to differ from the past); and the weighted-average expected life is based on the historical behavior of employees related
to exercises, forfeitures and cancellations.

The Company’s equity grants for the year ended December 31,
2011 were the issuance of 1) 7,259 shares of long-term restricted stock to certain senior executives on February 24, 2011, at a
fair market value of $14.54 per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date, and 2) 21,210
shares of common stock to non-employee directors on June 1, 2011 (1,414 shares per director), at a fair market value of $11.39
per share, which was the closing price of the Company’s common stock on that date.
 
The Company’s only equity grants for the year ended December
31, 2010 were the issuance of 15,585 shares of common stock to non-employee directors on June 1, 2010 (1,039 shares per director).
The fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date was $15.51 per share, which was the closing price of
the Company’s common stock on that date.
 
The per share weighted-average fair value of options granted during
2009 was $6.06 on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Company recorded total stock-based compensation expense of $905,000,
$640,000 and $449,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of the $905,000 in expense that was recorded
in 2011, approximately $242,000 related to the June 1, 2011 director grants, which is classified as “other operating expenses”
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining $663,000 in expense relates the employee grants discussed above and is
recorded as “salaries expense.” Stock based compensation is reflected as an adjustment to cash flows from operating
activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recognized $353,000, $250,000, and $180,000
of income tax benefits related to stock based compensation expense in the income statement for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
As noted above, certain of the Company’s stock option grants
contain terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service
period. The Company has elected to recognize compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense is based on the estimated number of stock options
and awards that will ultimately vest. Over the past five years, there have only been minimal amounts of forfeitures, and therefore
the Company assumes that all options granted without performance conditions will become vested.

As discussed above, the Company granted 81,337 performance units
to 19 senior officers on June 17, 2008. Each performance unit represents the right to acquire one share of the Company’s
common stock upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions (discussed above). The fair market value of the Company’s common
stock on the grant date was $16.53 per share. One-third of this grant was forfeited on December 31, 2008 and another one-third
was forfeited on December 31, 2010 because the Company failed to meet the minimum performance goal required for vesting. Also,
as discussed above, the Company granted 29,267 and 7,259 long-term restricted shares of common stock to certain senior executives
on December 11, 2009 and February 24, 2011, respectively.

Note 16. Regulatory Restrictions
 
The Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and is subject
to securities registration and public reporting regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Bank is regulated by
the FDIC and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks.
 
The primary source of funds for the payment of dividends by the
Company is dividends received from its subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank, as a North Carolina banking corporation, may pay dividends
only out of undivided profits as determined pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes Section 53-87. As of December 31, 2011,
the Bank had undivided profits of approximately $197,681,000 which were available for the payment of dividends (subject to remaining
in compliance with regulatory capital requirements). As of December 31, 2011, approximately $199,512,000 of the Company’s
investment in the Bank is restricted as to transfer to the Company without obtaining prior regulatory approval.
 
The average reserve balance maintained by the Bank under the requirements
of the Federal Reserve Board was approximately $410,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.

    Table of Contents
      
The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements
established by the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory,
and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company
and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities,
and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital
amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other
factors. These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of “Tier 1” capital to
total risk-weighted assets (“Tier I Capital Ratio”) and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and 8.00% (“Total
Capital Ratio”), respectively. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders’ equity, excluding unrealized gains
or losses from the securities available for sale, less intangible assets, and total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus
certain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted assets refer
to the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set
forth in Federal Reserve Board and FDIC regulations.
 
In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described above,
the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined
above) to quarterly average total assets (“Leverage Ratio) of 3.00% to 5.00%, depending upon the institution’s composite
ratings as determined by its regulators. The Federal Reserve Board has not advised the Company of any requirement specifically
applicable to it.
 
In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above,
the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines applicable to banks for classification
as “well capitalized,” which are presented with the minimum ratios, the Company’s ratios and the Bank’s
ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 in the following table. Based on the most recent notification from its regulators, the
Bank is well capitalized under the framework. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes
have changed the Company’s classification.
 
Also see Note 19 for discussion of preferred stock transactions
that have affected the Company’s capital ratios.

Note 19. Participation in the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase
Program and Small Business Lending Fund
 
U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program
 
On January 9, 2009, the Company completed the sale of $65 million
of Series A preferred stock to the United States Treasury Department (Treasury) under the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program.
The program was designed to attract broad participation by healthy banking institutions to help stabilize the financial system
and increase lending for the benefit of the U.S. economy.
 
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received
(i) 65,000 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share and (ii) a
warrant to purchase 616,308 shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value, in exchange for $65 million. As discussed
below, the Company redeemed this preferred stock in the third quarter of 2011 and repurchased the common stock warrant in the fourth
quarter of 2011.
 
The Series A preferred stock qualified as Tier 1 capital and its
terms required cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% for the first five years, and 9% thereafter.
 
The warrant had a 10-year term and became immediately exercisable
upon its issuance, with an exercise price equal to $15.82 per share.

The Company allocated the $65 million in proceeds to the preferred
stock and the common stock warrant based on their relative fair values. To determine the fair value of the preferred stock, the
Company used a discounted cash flow model that assumed redemption of the preferred stock at the end of year five. The discount
rate utilized was 13% and the estimated fair value was determined to be $36.2 million. The fair value of the common stock warrant
was estimated to be $2.8 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:

the common stock warrant was determined to be $39.0 million, with 7% of this aggregate total attributable to the warrant and
93% attributable to the preferred stock. Therefore, the $65 million issuance was allocated with $60.4 million being assigned to
the preferred stock and $4.6 million being assigned to the common stock warrant.
 
The $4.6 million difference between the $65 million face value of
the preferred stock and the $60.4 million allocated to it upon issuance was recorded as a discount on the preferred stock. Until
the Company redeemed the preferred stock in the third quarter of 2011 (discussed below), the $4.6 million discount was being
accreted, using the effective interest method, as a reduction in net income available to common shareholders over a five-year period
at approximately $0.8 million to $1.0 million per year.
 
On September 1, 2011, the Company redeemed the 65,000 shares of
outstanding Series A preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury for a redemption price of $65 million, plus unpaid dividends. The Company
funded the majority of this transaction by simultaneously issuing Series B preferred stock to the Treasury as part of the Small
Business Lending Fund (see below).
 
Due to the redemption of the preferred stock, the Company accreted
the remaining discount of $2.3 million during the third quarter of 2011, which resulted in total discount accretion for 2011 of
$2.9 million, which compared to $0.9 million recorded in 2010 and $0.8 million in 2009. Preferred stock discount accretion is deducted
from net income in computing “Net income available to common shareholders.”
 
In November 2011, the Company repurchased the outstanding common
stock warrant from the Treasury for $1.50 per common share, or a total of $924,000.
 
Small Business Lending Fund
 
On September 1, 2011, the Company completed the sale of $63.5 million
of Series B preferred stock to the Secretary of the Treasury under the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). The fund was established
under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified
community banks with assets less than $10 billion.
 
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received
63,500 shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $63.5 million.

The Series B preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital. The dividend
rate, as a percentage of the liquidation amount, can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the
Series B preferred stock is outstanding, based upon changes in the level of “Qualified Small Business Lending” or “QBSL”.
For the first nine quarters after issuance, the dividend rate can range from one percent (1%) to five percent (5%) per annum based
upon the increase in QBSL as compared to the baseline. For the two quarters subsequent to the issuance in 2011, the Company paid
a dividend rate of 5%. Based upon an increase in the level of QBSL over the baseline level calculated under the terms of the related
purchase agreement, the dividend rate for the next dividend period (which will end on March 31, 2012) is expected to be 4.8%, subject
to confirmation by Treasury. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance, the dividend rate will
be fixed at between one percent (1%) and seven percent (7%) based upon the level of QBSL compared to the baseline. After four and
one half years from the issuance, the dividend rate will increase to nine percent (9%). Subject to regulatory approval, the Company
is generally permitted to redeem the Series B preferred shares at par plus unpaid dividends.
 
 
There was no discount recorded related to the SBLF preferred stock
(because no warrants were issued in connection with this preferred stock issuance), and therefore there will be no future amounts
recorded for preferred stock discount accretion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM
 
 
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
First Bancorp
Troy, North Carolina
 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
First Bancorp and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements
of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2011. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First Bancorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 14, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
First Bancorp
Troy, North Carolina
 
We have audited the internal control over financial
reporting of First Bancorp and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the “COSO criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (b)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
 
We have also audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 and our report dated March 14, 2012 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

None.
 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
 
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures 
 
As of the end of the period covered by
this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and
chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which are
our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports
with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods.  Disclosure controls and procedures
include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed is communicated
to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on the evaluation, our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing timely decisions regarding
disclosure to be made about material information required to be included in our periodic reports with the SEC.
 
Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
 
Management of First Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework, management of the Company has concluded the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f), as of December 31,
2011.
 
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute
assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human
failures. Internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because
of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal
control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore,
it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
 
Management is also responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include, as necessary,
best estimates and judgments by management.

All deposits were assumed by the Bank with no losses to any depositor.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Cooperative Bank operated through twenty-one branches in North Carolinaand three branches in South Carolina, with assets totaling approximately $959 million and approximately 200 employees.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by twoloss share agreements between the FDIC and the Bank, which affords the Bank significant loss protection. Under the loss share agreements,the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million and 95% of losses in excess of thatamount. The term for loss sharing on residential real estate loans is ten years, while the term for loss sharing on non-residentialreal estate loans is five years in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries. The reimbursable losses fromthe FDIC are based on the book value of the relevant loan as determined by the FDIC at the date of the transaction. New loans madeafter that date are not covered by the loss share agreements.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Bank received a $123 million discount on the assets acquiredand paid no deposit premium. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with relevantaccounting guidance. The purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values,and identifiable intangible assets were recorded at fair value. Fair values were subject to refinement for up to one year afterthe closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values became available. The Company recordedan estimated receivable from the FDIC in the amount of $185.1 million as of June 30, 2009, which represented the FDIC&#146;s portionof the losses that were expected to be incurred and reimbursed to the Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">An acquisition gain totaling $67.9 million resulted from the acquisitionand is included as a component of noninterest income in the Company&#146;s statement of income. In the Company&#146;s filingsfor the second quarter 2009, this gain was reported as being $53.8 million. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Companyobtained third-party appraisals for the majority of Cooperative Bank&#146;s collateral dependent problem loans. Overall, the appraisedvalues were higher than the Company&#146;s original estimates made as of the acquisition date. In addition, during the third andfourth quarters of 2009, the Company received payoffs related to certain loans for which losses had been anticipated. Accordingly,as required by accounting guidance, the Company retrospectively adjusted the fair value of the loans acquired for these factors,which resulted in a higher gain being reflected in the second quarter of 2009.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

The Company&#146;s shareholders approved all equity-basedcompensation plans, except for those assumed from acquired companies. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan became effective uponthe approval of shareholders on May 2, 2007. As of December 31, 2011, the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan was the only plan thathad shares available for future grants.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan is intended to serve as a meansto attract, retain and motivate key employees and directors and to associate the interests of the plans&#146; participants withthose of the Company and its shareholders. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan allows for both grants of stock options and othertypes of equity-based compensation, including stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted performance stock, unrestrictedstock, and performance units.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Prior to the June 17, 2008 grant (discussed below), stock optiongrants to employees generally had five-year vesting schedules (20% vesting each year) and had been irregular, usually falling intothree categories - 1) to attract and retain new employees, 2) to recognize changes in responsibilities of existing employees, and3) to periodically reward exemplary performance. Compensation expense associated with these types of grants is recorded pro-ratablyover the vesting period. As it relates to directors, until 2010 the Company had historically granted 2,250 vested stock optionsto each of the Company&#146;s non-employee directors in June of each year. In June 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 1,414 commonshares and 1,039 common shares, respectively, to each non-employee director, which had approximately the same value as 2,250 stockoptions. Compensation expense associated with these director grants is recognized on the date of grant since there are no vestingconditions.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The June 17, 2008 grant of a combination of performance units andstock options have both performance conditions (earnings per share targets) and service conditions that must be met in order tovest. The 262,599 stock options and 81,337 performance units represented the maximum number of options and performance units thatcould have vested if the Company were to achieve specified maximum goals for earnings per share during the three annual performanceperiods ending on December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Up to one-third of the total number of options and performance units grantedwere subject to vesting annually as of December 31 of each year beginning in 2010, if (1) the Company achieved specific earningsper share (EPS) goals during the corresponding performance period and (2) the executive or key employee continued employment fora period of two years beyond the corresponding performance period. Compensation expense for this grant was recorded over the variousservice periods based on the estimated number of options and performance units that were probable to vest. No compensation costis recognized for awards that do not vest and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. The Company did notachieve the minimum earnings per share performance goal for 2008 or 2010, and thus two-thirds of the above grant was permanentlyforfeited. As a result of the significant acquisition gain realized in June 2009 related to a failed bank acquisition, the Companyachieved the EPS goal for 2009 and the related awards fully vested on December 31, 2011 for each grantee that remained employedthrough that date. The Company recorded compensation expense of $299,000 in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011 related to the vestingof these awards.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company granted long-term restricted shares of common stockto senior executives on December 11, 2009 and February 24, 2011, with vesting terms in accordance with the minimum rules for long-termequity grants for companies participating in the U.S. Treasury&#146;s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). These rules requirethat the vesting of the stock be tied to repayment of the financial assistance, with a two year minimum vesting period. The Companyoriginally projected the repayment to occur five years after the date of the TARP issuance, and thus the amortization schedulefor the expense was based on a repayment date of January 9, 2014. However, the Company redeemed 100% of the TARP preferred stockon September 1, 2011. Therefore, the Company recast the amortization schedule for both grants to be based on the vesting date twoyears after the grant. The total compensation expense associated with the December 11, 2009 grant was $398,000 and was being initiallyamortized over a four-year period at approximately $100,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2009 grant fully vested onDecember 11, 2011. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $298,000 for 2011. Thetotal compensation expense associated with the February 24, 2011 grant was $105,500 and was being initially amortized over a three-yearperiod at approximately $35,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2011 grant will fully vest on February 24, 2013. Accordingly,the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $42,000 in 2011.

These estimates do not reflect any premium or discountthat could result from offering for sale at one time the Company&#146;s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Company&#146;s financial instruments, fair value estimatesare based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of variousfinancial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significantjudgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheetfinancial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilitiesthat are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilitiesinclude net premises and equipment, intangible and other assets such as foreclosed properties, deferred income taxes, prepaid expenseaccounts, income taxes currently payable and other various accrued expenses. In addition, the income tax ramifications relatedto the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been consideredin any of the estimates.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Relevant accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchywhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fairvalue.

The Company sponsors a retirement savings planpursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who have completed one year of service are eligible to participatein the plan. New employees, who have met the service requirement, are automatically enrolled in the plan at a 2% deferral rate,which can be modified by the employee at any time. An eligible employee may contribute up to 15% of annual salary to the plan.The Company contributes an amount equal to 75% of the first 6% of the employee&#146;s salary contributed. Participants vest inCompany contributions at the rate of 20% after one year of service, and 20% for each additional year of service, with 100% vestingafter five years of service. The Company&#146;s matching contribution expense was $1,198,000, $1,107,000, and $933,000, for theyears ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Additionally, the Company made additional discretionary matching contributionsto the plan of $200,000 in 2009. The Company did not make a discretionary contribution in 2011 or 2010. The Company&#146;s matchingand discretionary contributions are made in the form of Company stock, which can be transferred by the employee into other investmentoptions offered by the plan at any time. Employees are not permitted to invest their own contributions in Company stock.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0"><u>Pension Plan</u>. The Company sponsors a noncontributory definedbenefit retirement plan (the &#147;Pension Plan&#148;), which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal RevenueCode. Employees who have attained age 21 and completed one year of service are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. ThePension Plan provides for a monthly payment, at normal retirement age of 65, equal to one-twelfth of the sum of (i) 0.75% of FinalAverage Annual Compensation (5 highest consecutive calendar years&#146; earnings out of the last 10 years of employment) multipliedby the employee&#146;s years of service not in excess of 40 years, and (ii) 0.65% of Final Average Annual Compensation in excessof &#147;covered compensation&#148; multiplied by years of service not in excess of 35 years. &#147;Covered compensation&#148;means the average of the social security taxable wage base during the 35 year period ending with the year the employee attainssocial security retirement age. Early retirement, with reduced monthly benefits, is available at age 55 after 15 years of service.The Pension Plan provides for 100% vesting after 5 years of service, and provides for a death benefit to a vested participant&#146;ssurviving spouse. The costs of benefits under the Pension Plan, which are borne by the Company, are computed actuarially and defrayedby earnings from the Pension Plan&#146;s investments. The compensation covered by the Pension Plan includes total earnings beforereduction for contributions to a cash or deferred profit-sharing plan (such as the 401(k) plan described above) and amounts usedto pay group health insurance premiums and includes bonuses (such as amounts paid under the incentive compensation plan). Compensationfor the purposes of the Pension Plan may not exceed statutory limits; such limits were $245,000 in 2011, $245,000 in 2010 and $235,000in 2009.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">During the second quarter of 2009, the Company amended the PensionPlan to prohibit new entrants into the plan.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in"></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company&#146;s contributions to the Pension Plan are basedon computations by independent actuarial consultants and are intended to provide the Company with the maximum deduction for incometax purposes.

The purpose of the SERP is to provide additional monthly pension benefits to ensure that each such senior management executivewould receive lifetime monthly pension benefits equal to 3% of his or her final average compensation multiplied by his or her yearsof service (maximum of 20 years) to the Company or its subsidiaries, subject to a maximum of 60% of his or her final average compensation.The amount of a participant&#146;s monthly SERP benefit is reduced by (i) the amount payable under the Company&#146;s qualifiedPension Plan (described above), and (ii) 50% of the participant&#146;s primary social security benefit. Final average compensationmeans the average of the 5 highest consecutive calendar years of earnings during the last 10 years of service prior to terminationof employment. The SERP is an unfunded plan. Payments are made from the general assets of the Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0"></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

The Company has no carrying amount for these standby lettersof credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf of the Company&#146;scustomers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of creditare generally for terms for one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment ofthe guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. Themaximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) the Company could be required to make under the guarantees in the eventof nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amountof the standby letter of credit. In the event that the Company is required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, alreadyexecuted with the customer, is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, the Companyhas had to honor several insignificant standby letters of credit, which have been or are being repaid by the borrower without anyloss to the Company. Management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings which, in management&#146;sopinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left; text-indent: 0in">The Bank grants primarily commercialand installment loans to customers throughout its market area, which consists of Anson, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Buncombe,Cabarrus, Carteret, Chatham, Columbus, Dare, Davidson, Duplin, Guilford, Harnett, Iredell, Lee, Montgomery, Moore, New Hanover,Onslow, Randolph, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rowan, Scotland, Stanly and Wake Counties in North Carolina, Chesterfield, Dillon,Florence and Horry Counties in South Carolina, and Montgomery, Pulaski, Washington and Wythe Counties in Virginia.

Additionally,there are industry practices that could subject the Company to increased credit risk should economic conditions change over thecourse of a loan&#146;s life. For example, the Company makes variable rate loans and fixed rate principal-amortizing loans withmaturities prior to the loan being fully paid (i.e. balloon payment loans). These loans are underwritten and monitored to managethe associated risks. The Company has determined that there is no concentration of credit risk associated with its lending policiesor practices.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company&#146;s investment portfolio consists principally ofobligations of government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, corporatebonds, FHLB stock and general obligation municipal securities.

Because ofthe loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans and foreclosed realestate are significantly different from those assets not covered under the loss share agreements.

After loans are initially graded, they are monitored monthly for credit quality based on many factors, suchas payment history, the borrower&#146;s financial status, and changes in collateral value.

As of December 31, 2011,the Bank had undivided profits of approximately $197,681,000 which were available for the payment of dividends (subject to remainingin compliance with regulatory capital requirements).

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory,and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#146;sfinancial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Companyand the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#146;s assets, liabilities,and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company&#146;s and Bank&#146;s capitalamounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and otherfactors. These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of &#147;Tier 1&#148; capital tototal risk-weighted assets (&#147;Tier I Capital Ratio&#148;) and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and 8.00% (&#147;TotalCapital Ratio&#148;), respectively. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders&#146; equity, excluding unrealized gainsor losses from the securities available for sale, less intangible assets, and total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital pluscertain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted assets referto the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas setforth in Federal Reserve Board and FDIC regulations.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described above,the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (as definedabove) to quarterly average total assets (&#147;Leverage Ratio) of 3.00% to 5.00%, depending upon the institution&#146;s compositeratings as determined by its regulators.

For the two quarters subsequent to the issuance in 2011, the Company paida dividend rate of 5%. Based upon an increase in the level of QBSL over the baseline level calculated under the terms of the relatedpurchase agreement, the dividend rate for the next dividend period (which will end on March 31, 2012) is expected to be 4.8%, subjectto confirmation by Treasury. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance, the dividend rate willbe fixed at between one percent (1%) and seven percent (7%) based upon the level of QBSL compared to the baseline. After four andone half years from the issuance, the dividend rate will increase to nine percent (9%). Subject to regulatory approval, the Companyis generally permitted to redeem the Series B preferred shares at par plus unpaid dividends.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">There was no discount recorded related to the SBLF preferred stock(because no warrants were issued in connection with this preferred stock issuance), and therefore there will be no future amountsrecorded for preferred stock discount accretion.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p>

The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries that are fully consolidated - First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (FirstBank Insurance) and First Troy SPE, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Subsequentevents have been evaluated through the date of filing this Form 10-K.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 13.5pt">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company is a bank holding company. The principal activity ofthe Company is the ownership and operation of the Bank, a state chartered bank with its main office in Troy, North Carolina. TheCompany is also the parent company for a series of statutory trusts that were formed at various times since 2002 for the purposeof issuing trust preferred debt securities. The trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes; however, notes issuedby the Company to the trusts in return for the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities are included in theconsolidated financial statements and have terms that are substantially the same as the corresponding trust preferred securities.The trust preferred securities qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. First Bank Insurance is an agentfor property and casualty insurance policies. First Troy SPE, LLC was formed in order to hold and dispose of certain real estateforeclosed upon by the Bank.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generallyaccepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affectthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statementsand the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.The most significant estimates made by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are the determinationof the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate, the accounting and impairment testing related to intangibleassets, and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0"><b>(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents</b> <font style="font-family: Symbol">-</font>The Company considers all highly liquid assets such as cash on hand, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing amounts due frombanks and federal funds sold to be &#8220;cash equivalents.&#8221;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0"><b>(c) Securities </b><font style="font-family: Symbol">-</font>Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as &#8220;held to maturity&#8221;and carried at amortized cost.

Evidence of credit quality deteriorationas of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status. The accounting guidance permits the useof the cost recovery method of income recognition for those purchased impaired loans for which the timing and amount of cash flowsexpected to be collected cannot be reasonably estimated. Under the cost recovery method of income recognition, all cash receiptsare initially applied to principal, with interest income being recorded only after the carrying value of the loan has been reducedto zero. Substantially all of the Company&#146;s purchased impaired loans to date have had uncertain cash flows and thus are accountedfor under the cost recovery method of income recognition.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">For nonimpaired purchased loans, the Company accretes any fair valuediscount over the life of the loan in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in management&#146;sjudgment, the collection of interest appears doubtful. The accrual of interest is discontinued on all loans that become 90 daysor more past due with respect to principal or interest. The past due status of loans is based on the contractual payment terms.While a loan is on nonaccrual status, the Company&#146;s policy is that all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recordedprincipal balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off.Further cash receipts are recorded as interest income to the extent that any interest has been foregone. Loans are removed fromnonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when concern no longer exists as to the collectabilityof principal or interest. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured toprovide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms. The nonaccrual policy discussed above applies to allloan classifications.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current informationand events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loanagreement. Impaired loans are measured using either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that the Company expects to receive from theborrower discounted at the loan&#146;s effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of thecollateral. Unless restructured, while a loan is considered to be impaired, the Company&#146;s policy is that interest accrualis discontinued and all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded principal balance has been reduced to zero, futurecash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off. Further cash receipts are recorded as interest incometo the extent that any interest has been foregone. Impaired loans that are restructured are returned to accruing status in accordancewith the restructured terms if the Company believes that the borrower will be able to meet the obligations of the restructuredloan terms.

The terms of the loans areset by the secondary investors, and the purchase price that the investor will pay for the loan is agreed to prior to the fundingof the loan by the Company. Generally within three weeks after funding, the loans are transferred to the investor in accordancewith the agreed-upon terms. The Company records gains from the sale of these loans on the settlement date of the sale equal tothe difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loan. The gain generally represents the portion ofthe proceeds attributed to service release premiums received from the investors and the realization of origination fees receivedfrom borrowers that were deferred as part of the carrying amount of the loan. Between the initial funding of the loans by the Companyand the subsequent reimbursement by the investors, the Company carries the loans on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or market.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 13.7pt">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Periodically, the Company originates commercial loans that are intendedfor resale.

Loans are charged-off againstthe allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The provision forloan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance consideredadequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. Management&#8217;s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is basedon several factors, including:</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 10pt"><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td style="width: 5%">&#160;</td>    <td style="width: 5%">1.</td>    <td style="width: 90%">Risk grades assigned to the loans in the portfolio,</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td>&#160;</td>    <td>2.</td>    <td>Specific reserves for larger loans with concerns regarding repayment ability,</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td>&#160;</td>    <td>3.</td>    <td>Current economic conditions, including the local, state, and national economic outlook; interest rate risk; trends in loan volume, mix and size of loans; seasoning of the loan portfolio; levels and trends of delinquencies,</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td>&#160;</td>    <td>4.</td>    <td>Historical loan loss experience with the more recent periods carrying a higher weight, and</td></tr><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td>&#160;</td>    <td>5.</td>    <td>An assessment of the risk characteristics of the Company&#146;s loan portfolio, including industry concentrations, payment structures, and credit administration practices.</td></tr></table><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.1in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">While management uses the best information available to make evaluations,future adjustments may be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 13.5pt">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">For loans covered under loss share agreements, subsequent decreasesto the expected cash flows will generally result in additional provisions for loan losses.

Currently, the Company&#8217;s potentiallydilutive common stock issuances relate to grants under the Company&#8217;s equity-based plans, including 1) stock options, 2) performanceunits, and 3) restricted stock grants. In computing Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, it is assumed that all dilutive stock optionsare exercised during the reporting period at their respective exercise prices, with the proceeds from the exercises used by theCompany to buy back stock in the open market at the average market price in effect during the reporting period. The differencebetween the number of shares assumed to be exercised and the number of shares bought back is included in the calculation of dilutivesecurities. Performance units vest if certain financial goals and service conditions are met. Once vested, one performance unitis equal to one share of common stock. Performance units are included in the calculation of dilutive securities if the financialgoals for a measurement period have been met, even if service requirements have not been met. Restricted stock grants issued bythe Company vest solely on service conditions, and thus these shares are included in the calculation of dilutive securities.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

Except for disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings (discussed in nextparagraph), the required disclosures became effective for periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The Company is requiredto include these disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements. See Note 4 for required disclosures.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance to assist creditors withtheir determination of when a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. The determination is based on whether the restructuringconstitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, as both events must be present. This guidanceand the new disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,2011. See Note 4 for required disclosures.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to modify <font style="color: black">Step1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entityis required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.Any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption.Impairments occurring subsequent to adoption should be included in earnings. The amendment was effective for the Company beginningJanuary 1, 2011 and did not impact the Company.</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In September 2011, the FASB issued additional amended guidance relatedto goodwill impairment testing. Guidance now permits an entity to consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether itis necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This amendment will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2012and is not expected to impact the Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Also in December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance s<font style="color: black">pecifyingthat if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combinedentity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparableprior annual reporting period only. </font>The amendment also requires that the supplemental pro forma disclosures include a descriptionof the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinationincluded in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This amendment is effective for the Company <font style="color: black">forbusiness combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The Company does not expect this guidanceto have a material impact on its financial statements.</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In June 2011, the FASB amended the comprehensive income guidanceby eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholders&#146; equity.The amendment requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income and requires an entityto present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements.In December 2011, the FASB deferred the effective date of presenting reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive incometo net income on the face of the financial statements. The remaining amendments of the guidance will be applicable to the Companyon January 1, 2012 and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has consistently followed the new requirements in prior filings,and thus this guidance will not change the way the Company has presented its financial statements.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Other accounting standards that have been issuedor proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s financialposition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>

      Carrying value as of the balance sheet date of [accrued] interest payable on all forms of debt, including trade payables and interest on deposit liabilities; that has been incurred and is unpaid.
      
      Tax effect on the net gain or loss arising during the period for postretirement plans.
      
      Tax effect on the amortization of prior service cost and transition obligation.
      
      The amount recorded in earnings for the periodic recognition of adjustments for bank acquisitions and FDIC assisted transactions.

        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
        Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
(a) Basis of Presentation -
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Bancorp (the Company) and its wholly owned subsidiary - First
Bank (the Bank). The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries that are fully consolidated - First Bank Insurance Services, Inc. (First
Bank Insurance) and First Troy SPE, LLC. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Subsequent
events have been evaluated through the date of filing this Form 10-K.
 
The Company is a bank holding company. The principal activity of
the Company is the ownership and operation of the Bank, a state chartered bank with its main office in Troy, North Carolina. The
Company is also the parent company for a series of statutory trusts that were formed at various times since 2002 for the purpose
of issuing trust preferred debt securities. The trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes; however, notes issued
by the Company to the trusts in return for the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities are included in the
consolidated financial statements and have terms that are substantially the same as the corresponding trust preferred securities.
The trust preferred securities qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. First Bank Insurance is an agent
for property and casualty insurance policies. First Troy SPE, LLC was formed in order to hold and dispose of certain real estate
foreclosed upon by the Bank.
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates made by the Company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are the determination
of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate, the accounting and impairment testing related to intangible
assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions.
 
(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents -
The Company considers all highly liquid assets such as cash on hand, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing amounts due from
banks and federal funds sold to be “cash equivalents.”
 
(c) Securities -
Debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held to maturity”
and carried at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as “available for sale”
and carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being reported as other comprehensive income and reported as a separate
component of shareholders’ equity.
 
A decline in the market value of any available
for sale or held to maturity security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount
to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Any equity security
that is in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months is presumed to be other than temporarily impaired and an impairment
charge is recorded unless the amount of the charge is insignificant.
Gains and losses on sales of securities are recognized at the time
of sale based upon the specific identification method. Premiums and discounts are amortized into income on a level yield basis,
with premiums being amortized to the earliest call date and discounts being accreted to the stated maturity date.
 
(d) Premises and Equipment -
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation, computed by the straight-line method, is
charged to operations over the estimated useful lives of the properties, which range from 2 to 40 years or, in the case of leasehold
improvements, over the term of the lease, if shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations in the year incurred. Gains
and losses on dispositions are included in current operations.
 
(e) Loans  Loans are stated at the principal amount
outstanding less any partial charge-offs plus deferred origination costs, net of nonrefundable loan fees. Interest on loans is
accrued on the unpaid principal balance outstanding. Net deferred loan origination costs/fees are capitalized and recognized as
a yield adjustment over the life of the related loan.
 
The Company does not hold any interest-only strips, loans, other
receivables, or retained interests in securitizations that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that it would
not recover substantially all of its recorded investment.
 
Purchased loans acquired in a business combination, which include
loans that were purchased in the 2009 Cooperative Bank acquisition and the 2011 Bank of Asheville acquisition, are recorded at
estimated fair value on their purchase date. The purchaser cannot carry over any related allowance for loan losses.
 
The Company follows specific accounting guidance related to purchased
impaired loans when purchased loans have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition
that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. Evidence of credit quality deterioration
as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status. The accounting guidance permits the use
of the cost recovery method of income recognition for those purchased impaired loans for which the timing and amount of cash flows
expected to be collected cannot be reasonably estimated. Under the cost recovery method of income recognition, all cash receipts
are initially applied to principal, with interest income being recorded only after the carrying value of the loan has been reduced
to zero. Substantially all of the Companys purchased impaired loans to date have had uncertain cash flows and thus are accounted
for under the cost recovery method of income recognition.
 
For nonimpaired purchased loans, the Company accretes any fair value
discount over the life of the loan in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.
 
A loan is placed on nonaccrual status when, in managements
judgment, the collection of interest appears doubtful. The accrual of interest is discontinued on all loans that become 90 days
or more past due with respect to principal or interest. The past due status of loans is based on the contractual payment terms.
While a loan is on nonaccrual status, the Companys policy is that all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded
principal balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off.
Further cash receipts are recorded as interest income to the extent that any interest has been foregone. Loans are removed from
nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when concern no longer exists as to the collectability
of principal or interest. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to
provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms. The nonaccrual policy discussed above applies to all
loan classifications.
 
A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information
and events, it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan
agreement. Impaired loans are measured using either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that the Company expects to receive from the
borrower discounted at the loans effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the
collateral. Unless restructured, while a loan is considered to be impaired, the Companys policy is that interest accrual
is discontinued and all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded principal balance has been reduced to zero, future
cash receipts are applied to recoveries of any amounts previously charged off. Further cash receipts are recorded as interest income
to the extent that any interest has been foregone. Impaired loans that are restructured are returned to accruing status in accordance
with the restructured terms if the Company believes that the borrower will be able to meet the obligations of the restructured
loan terms. The impairment policy discussed above applies to all loan classifications.
 
(f) Presold Mortgages in Process of Settlement and Loans Held
for Sale - As a part of normal business operations, the Company originates residential
mortgage loans that have been pre-approved by secondary investors to be sold on a best efforts basis. The terms of the loans are
set by the secondary investors, and the purchase price that the investor will pay for the loan is agreed to prior to the funding
of the loan by the Company. Generally within three weeks after funding, the loans are transferred to the investor in accordance
with the agreed-upon terms. The Company records gains from the sale of these loans on the settlement date of the sale equal to
the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the loan. The gain generally represents the portion of
the proceeds attributed to service release premiums received from the investors and the realization of origination fees received
from borrowers that were deferred as part of the carrying amount of the loan. Between the initial funding of the loans by the Company
and the subsequent reimbursement by the investors, the Company carries the loans on its balance sheet at the lower of cost or market.
 
Periodically, the Company originates commercial loans that are intended
for resale. The Company carries these loans at the lower of cost or fair value at each reporting date. There were no such loans
held for sale as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
 
(g) Allowance for Loan Losses -
The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged-off against
the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely. The provision for
loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered
adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based
on several factors, including:
 
     
    1.
    Risk grades assigned to the loans in the portfolio,
     
    2.
    Specific reserves for larger loans with concerns regarding repayment ability,
     
    3.
    Current economic conditions, including the local, state, and national economic outlook; interest rate risk; trends in loan volume, mix and size of loans; seasoning of the loan portfolio; levels and trends of delinquencies,
     
    4.
    Historical loan loss experience with the more recent periods carrying a higher weight, and
     
    5.
    An assessment of the risk characteristics of the Companys loan portfolio, including industry concentrations, payment structures, and credit administration practices.
 
While management uses the best information available to make evaluations,
future adjustments may be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used.
 
For loans covered under loss share agreements, subsequent decreases
to the expected cash flows will generally result in additional provisions for loan losses. Subsequent increases in expected cash
flows will result in a reversal of the allowance for loan losses to the extent of prior allowance recognition.
 
In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the Banks allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Bank to
recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of
their examinations.
 
(h) Other Real Estate -
Other real estate owned consists primarily of real estate acquired by the Company through legal foreclosure or deed in lieu of
foreclosure. The property is initially carried at the lower of cost (generally the loan balance plus additional costs incurred
for improvements to the property) or the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs. If there are subsequent
declines in fair value, which is reviewed routinely by management, the property is written down to its fair value through a charge
to expense. Capital expenditures made to improve the property are capitalized. Costs of holding real estate, such as property taxes,
insurance and maintenance, less related revenues during the holding period, are recorded as expense.
 
(i) FDIC Indemnification Asset  The FDIC indemnification
asset relates to loss share agreements with the FDIC, whereby the FDIC has agreed to reimburse to the Company a percentage of the
losses related to loans and other real estate that the Company assumed in the acquisition of two failed banks. This indemnification
asset is measured separately from the loan portfolio and other real estate because it is not contractually embedded in the loans
and is not transferable with the loans should the Company choose to dispose of them. The carrying value of this receivable at each
period end is the sum of:  1) actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been
received and 2) the Companys estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied
by the FDIC reimbursement percentage.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the amount of actual claims that had been submitted
to the FDIC for reimbursement but had not yet been received was $13.4 million and $30.2 million, respectively.
 
(j) Income Taxes -
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced, if necessary, by the amount of such benefits that are
not expected to be realized based upon available evidence. The Company’s investment tax credits, which are low income housing
tax credits and state historic tax credits, are recorded in the period that they are reflected in the Company’s tax returns.
 
(k) Intangible Assets -
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized
separately and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which for the Company has generally been seven to ten years and
at an accelerated rate. Goodwill is recognized in business combinations to the extent that the price paid exceeds the fair value
of the net assets acquired, including any identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but as discussed in Note 1(p),
is subject to fair value impairment tests on at least an annual basis.
 
(l) Other Investments  The Company accounts
for investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), and other privately held companies using
either the cost or the equity method of accounting. The accounting treatment depends upon the Companys percentage ownership
and degree of management influence.
 
Under the cost method of accounting, the Company records an investment
in stock at cost and generally recognizes cash dividends received as income. If cash dividends received exceed the investees
earnings since the investment date, these payments are considered a return of investment and reduce the cost of the investment.
 
Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its initial
investment at cost. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased to reflect the Companys
share of income or loss of the investee. The Companys recognition of earnings or losses from an equity method investment
is based on the Companys ownership percentage in the investee and the investees earnings on a quarterly basis. The
investees generally provide their financial information during the quarter following the end of a given period. The Companys
policy is to record its share of earnings or losses on equity method investments in the quarter the financial information is received.
 
All of the Companys investments in limited partnerships,
LLCs, and other companies are privately held, and their market values are not readily available. The Companys management
evaluates its investments in investees for impairment based on the investees ability to generate cash through its operations
or obtain alternative financing, and other subjective factors. There are inherent risks associated with the Companys investments
in such companies, which may result in income statement volatility in future periods.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Companys investments
in limited partnerships, LLCs and other privately held companies totaled $2.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and were
included in other assets.
 
(m) Stock Option Plan -
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four equity-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 15.
The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of relevant accounting guidance.
 
(n) Per Share Amounts -
Basic Earnings Per Common Share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted Earnings Per Common Share is computed by assuming the issuance of common
shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Currently, the Company’s potentially
dilutive common stock issuances relate to grants under the Company’s equity-based plans, including 1) stock options, 2) performance
units, and 3) restricted stock grants. In computing Diluted Earnings Per Common Share, it is assumed that all dilutive stock options
are exercised during the reporting period at their respective exercise prices, with the proceeds from the exercises used by the
Company to buy back stock in the open market at the average market price in effect during the reporting period. The difference
between the number of shares assumed to be exercised and the number of shares bought back is included in the calculation of dilutive
securities. Performance units vest if certain financial goals and service conditions are met. Once vested, one performance unit
is equal to one share of common stock. Performance units are included in the calculation of dilutive securities if the financial
goals for a measurement period have been met, even if service requirements have not been met. Restricted stock grants issued by
the Company vest solely on service conditions, and thus these shares are included in the calculation of dilutive securities.
 
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators
used in computing Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share:

For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were
396,669 options, 604,752 options and 704,018 options, respectively, that were anti-dilutive because the exercise price exceeded
the average market price for the year, and thus are not included in the calculation to determine the effect of dilutive securities.
In addition, the warrant for 616,308 shares issued to the Treasury in 2009 and repurchased by the Company in 2011 was anti-dilutive
for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009  see Note 19 for additional information.
 
(o) Fair Value of Financial Instruments -
Relevant accounting guidance requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for its financial instruments. Fair value
methods and assumptions are set forth below for the Company’s financial instruments.
 
Cash and Amounts Due from Banks, Federal Funds Sold, Presold Mortgages
in Process of Settlement, Accrued Interest Receivable, and Accrued Interest Payable -
The carrying amounts approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments.
 
Available for Sale and Held to Maturity Securities -
Fair values are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.
 
Loans - Fair values are
estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, financial
and agricultural, real estate construction, real estate mortgages and installment loans to individuals. Each loan category is further
segmented into fixed and variable interest rate terms. The fair value for each category is determined by discounting scheduled
future cash flows using current interest rates offered on loans with similar risk characteristics. Fair values for impaired loans
are estimated based on discounted cash flows or underlying collateral values, where applicable.
 
FDIC Indemnification Asset  Fair value is equal to the FDIC
reimbursement rate of the expected losses to be incurred and reimbursed by the FDIC and then discounted over the estimated period
of receipt.
 
Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase -
The fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest-bearing
demand deposits, savings, NOW, and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand as of the valuation date. The
fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated
using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
 
Borrowings - The fair value
of borrowings is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered by the Company’s lenders for debt of similar remaining maturities.
 
Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit -
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments had no carrying value. The large majority
of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are at variable rates and/or have relatively short terms to maturity.
Therefore, the fair value for these financial instruments is considered to be immaterial.
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based
on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount
that could result from offering for sale at one time the Companys entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
Because no highly liquid market exists for a significant portion of the Companys financial instruments, fair value estimates
are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various
financial instruments, and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
 
Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet
financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities
that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities
include net premises and equipment, intangible and other assets such as foreclosed properties, deferred income taxes, prepaid expense
accounts, income taxes currently payable and other various accrued expenses. In addition, the income tax ramifications related
to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered
in any of the estimates.
 
(p) Impairment -
Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to their related
carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company determines whether the implied fair
value of the goodwill, using various valuation techniques, exceeds the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of
the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.
 
The Company reviews all other long-lived assets, including identifiable
intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Companys policy is that an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than
the carrying amount of the asset. Any long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
value, less costs to sell.
 
To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment write-downs
of its long-lived assets or goodwill.
 
(q) Comprehensive Income -
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period for non-owner transactions and is divided into net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that are excluded
from earnings under current accounting standards. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the Company
are as follows:

(r) Segment Reporting -
Accounting standards require management to report selected financial and descriptive information about reportable operating segments.
The standards also require related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. Generally, disclosures
are required for segments internally identified to evaluate performance and resource allocation. The Company’s operations
are primarily within the banking segment, and the financial statements presented herein reflect the results of that segment. The
Company has no foreign operations or customers.
 
(s) Reclassifications -
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect
on net income or shareholders’ equity as previously presented, nor did they materially impact trends in financial information.
 
(t) Recent Accounting Pronouncements -
In July 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires an
entity to provide more information about the credit quality of its financing receivables, such as aging information, credit quality
indicators and troubled debt restructurings, in the disclosures to its financial statements.  The disclosures must be disaggregated
by portfolio segment or class.  The disaggregation of information is based on how the entity develops its allowance for credit
losses and how it manages its credit exposure. Except for disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings (discussed in next
paragraph), the required disclosures became effective for periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The Company is required
to include these disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements. See Note 4 for required disclosures.
 
In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance to assist creditors with
their determination of when a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. The determination is based on whether the restructuring
constitutes a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties, as both events must be present. This guidance
and the new disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings became effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2011. See Note 4 for required disclosures.
 
In December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance to modify Step
1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity
is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
Any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption.
Impairments occurring subsequent to adoption should be included in earnings. The amendment was effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2011 and did not impact the Company.
 
In September 2011, the FASB issued additional amended guidance related
to goodwill impairment testing. Guidance now permits an entity to consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it
is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This amendment will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2012
and is not expected to impact the Company.
 
Also in December 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance s pecifying
that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined
entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable
prior annual reporting period only. The amendment also requires that the supplemental pro forma disclosures include a description
of the nature and amount of any material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination
included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings. This amendment is effective for the Company for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The Company does not expect this guidance
to have a material impact on its financial statements.
 
In June 2011, the FASB amended the comprehensive income guidance
by eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
The amendment requires consecutive presentation of the statement of net income and other comprehensive income and requires an entity
to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements.
In December 2011, the FASB deferred the effective date of presenting reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income
to net income on the face of the financial statements. The remaining amendments of the guidance will be applicable to the Company
on January 1, 2012 and will be applied retrospectively. The Company has consistently followed the new requirements in prior filings,
and thus this guidance will not change the way the Company has presented its financial statements.
 
Other accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

For the years ended December

respectively, which reduced interest expense. The deposit premiums related to the Companys acquisitions are discussed in
Note 2. The Company has $123,000 remaining in unamortized deposit premiums at December 31, 2011.

borrowings by the Company with maturities less than one year and are collateralized by a portion of the Companys securities
portfolio, which have been delivered to a third-party custodian for safekeeping. At December 31, 2011, securities with an amortized
cost of $17,184,000 and a market value of $17,155,000 were pledged to secure securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

As noted in the table above,
at December 31, 2011 and 2010, borrowings outstanding included $31,000 and $176,000, respectively, in unamortized premium on borrowings
acquired from a 2008 acquisition. The originally recorded premium was $1,328,000, of which $145,000, $341,000, and $464,000 was
amortized in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, as a reduction of interest expense.
 
All outstanding FHLB borrowings may be accelerated immediately by
the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in the condition of the Company or if the Companys
qualifying collateral amounts to less than that required under the terms of the FHLB borrowing agreement.
 
In the above tables, the $20.6 million in borrowings due on January
23, 2034 relate to borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities that were issued by First Bancorp Capital Trusts
II and III ($10.3 million by each trust), which are unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Company, on December 19, 2003 and qualify
as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. These unsecured debt securities are callable by the Company at par on
any quarterly interest payment date beginning on January 23, 2009. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly
basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70%. The Company incurred approximately $580,000 of debt issuance costs related to
the issuance that were recorded as prepaid expenses and are included in the Other Assets line item of the consolidated
balance sheet. These debt issuance costs were amortized as interest expense until the earliest possible call date of January 23,
2009.
 
In the above tables, the $25.8 million in borrowings due on June
15, 2036 relate to borrowings structured as trust preferred capital securities that were issued by First Bancorp Capital Trust
IV, an unconsolidated subsidiary of the Company, on April 13, 2006 and qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.
These unsecured debt securities are callable by the Company at par on any quarterly interest payment date beginning on June 15,
2011. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.39%. The Company
incurred no debt issuance costs related to the issuance.
 
At December 31, 2011, the Company had four sources of readily available
borrowing capacity  1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, of which $88 million was outstanding
at December 31, 2011 and $62 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit
with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $33 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010,
3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmonds (FRB) discount window, of which
none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $55 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4) a $10 million holding company
line of credit with a commercial bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010.
 
The Companys line of credit with the FHLB totaling approximately
$389 million can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity needs
and is secured by the Companys FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of its real estate loan portfolio. In addition to the
outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, the borrowing capacity
was further reduced by $203 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, as a result of the Company pledging letters of credit for public
deposits at each of those dates. Accordingly, the Companys unused FHLB line of credit was $98 million at December 31, 2011.
 
The Companys correspondent bank relationship allows the Company
to purchase up to $50 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). The Company had no borrowings
outstanding under this line at December 31, 2011 and $33 million in borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2010.
 
The Company has a line of credit with the FRB discount window. This
line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of the Companys commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate).
Based on the collateral owned by the Company as of December 31, 2011, the available line of credit was approximately $79 million.
The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2011 and $55 million in borrowings outstanding
at December 31, 2010.
 
At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had a $10 million line
of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by 100% of the common stock of the Bank. This line of credit expires and is
subject to renewal in March of each year. The line of credit was not drawn at December 31, 2011 or 2010.

Note 4. Loans and Asset Quality Information
 
The loans and foreclosed real estate that were acquired in FDIC-assisted
transactions are covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and the Companys banking subsidiary, First Bank, which
afford First Bank significant loss protection. (See Note 2 above for more information regarding these transactions.) Because of
the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans and foreclosed real
estate are significantly different from those assets not covered under the loss share agreements. Accordingly, the Company presents
separately loans subject to the loss share agreements as covered loans in the information below and loans that are
not subject to the loss share agreements as non-covered loans.

As of December 31, 2011 and
2010, net loans include an unamortized premium of $949,000 and $687,000, respectively, related to acquired loans.
 
Loans in the amounts of $2,074,148,000 and $1,708,642,000 as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are pledged as collateral for certain borrowings (see Note 10).
 
The loans above also include loans to executive officers and directors
serving the Company at December 31, 2011 and to their associates, totaling approximately $6,004,000 and $5,097,000 at December
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, additions to such loans were approximately $1,253,000 and repayments totaled approximately
$346,000. These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other non-related borrowers. Management does not believe these loans involve more than
the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

As reflected in the table above, the Company accreted $11,598,000
and $7,607,000 of the loan discount on purchased nonimpaired loans into interest income during 2011 and 2010, respectively. As
of December 31, 2011, there was remaining loan discount of $89,837,000 related to purchased nonimpaired loans. If these loans continue
to be repaid by the borrowers, the Company will accrete the remaining loan discount into interest income over the lives of the
respective loans. In such circumstances, a corresponding entry to reduce the indemnification asset will be recorded amounting to
80% of the loan discount accretion, which reduces noninterest income.
 
The following table presents information regarding all purchased
impaired loans since December 31, 2009, substantially all of which are covered loans. The Company has applied the cost recovery
method to all purchased impaired loans at their respective acquisition dates due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected
cash flows, as reflected in the following table.

Each of the purchased impaired loans are on nonaccrual status and
considered to be impaired. Because of the uncertainty of the expected cash flows, the Company is accounting for each purchased
impaired loan under the cost recovery method, in which all cash payments are applied to principal. Thus, there is no accretable
yield associated with the above loans. During 2011 and 2010, the Company received $0 and $67,000, respectively, in payments that
exceeded the initial carrying amount of the purchased impaired loans, which is included in the loan discount accretion amount discussed
previously.
  
Nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans, restructured
loans, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and other real estate. Nonperforming assets are summarized as

If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2011,
2010, and 2009 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since

 All of the impaired loans noted in the table above were on
nonaccrual status at each respective period end except for those classified as restructured loans (see table on previous page
for balances).
 
The remaining tables in this note present information derived from
the Companys allowance for loan loss model. Relevant accounting guidance requires certain disclosures to be disaggregated
based on how the Company develops its allowance for loan losses and manages its credit exposure. This model combines loan types
in a different manner than the tables previously presented.

The Company tracks credit quality based on its internal risk ratings.
Upon origination a loan is assigned an initial risk grade, which is generally based on several factors such as the borrowers
credit score, the loan-to-value ratio, the debt-to-income ratio, etc. Loans that are risk-graded as substandard during the origination
process are declined. After loans are initially graded, they are monitored monthly for credit quality based on many factors, such
as payment history, the borrowers financial status, and changes in collateral value. Loans can be downgraded or upgraded
depending on managements evaluation of these factors. Internal risk-grading policies are consistent throughout each loan
type.
 
The following describes the Companys internal risk grades
in ascending order of likelihood of loss:
 
     
    Numerical Risk Grade
    Description
    Pass:
     
     
    1
    Cash secured loans.
     
    2
    Non-cash secured loans that have no minor or major exceptions to the lending guidelines.
     
    3
    Non-cash secured loans that have no major exceptions to the lending guidelines.
    Weak Pass:
     
     
    4
    Non-cash secured loans that have minor or major exceptions to the lending guidelines, but the exceptions are properly mitigated.
    Watch or Standard:
     
     
    9
    Loans that meet the guidelines for a Risk Graded 5 loan, except the collateral coverage is sufficient to satisfy the debt with no risk of loss under reasonable circumstances.  This category also includes all loans to insiders and any other loan that management elects to monitor on the watch list.
    Special Mention:
     
     
    5
    Existing loans with major exceptions that cannot be mitigated.
    Classified:
     
     
    6
    Loans that have a well-defined weakness that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt if deficiencies are not corrected.
     
    7
    Loans that have a well-defined weakness that make the collection or liquidation improbable.
     
    8
    Loans that are considered uncollectible and are in the process of being charged-off.

Troubled Debt Restructurings
 
The restructuring of a loan is considered a troubled debt
restructuring if both (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and (ii) the creditor has granted a concession.
Concessions may include interest rate reductions or below market interest rates, principal forgiveness, restructuring amortization
schedules and other actions intended to minimize potential losses.
 
The vast majority of the Companys troubled debt restructurings
modified during the year ended December 31, 2011 related to interest rate reductions combined with restructured amortization schedules.
The Company does not grant principal forgiveness.
 
All loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are considered
to be impaired and are evaluated as such for determination of the allowance for loan losses. The Companys troubled debt
restructurings can be classified as either nonaccrual or accruing based on the loans payment status. The troubled debt restructurings
that are nonaccrual are reported within the nonaccrual loan totals presented previously.

in a troubled debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2011.

In the above tables, all of the non-equity securities that were
in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are bonds that the Company has determined are in a loss position due
to interest rate factors, the overall economic downturn in the financial sector, and the broader economy in general. The Company
has evaluated the collectability of each of these bonds and has concluded that there is no other-than-temporary impairment. The
Company does not intend to sell these securities, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell
these securities before recovery of the amortized cost.
 
At December 31, 2011, the Companys $12.5 million investment
in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:

of the securities. The Companys policy is to record an impairment charge for any of these equity securities that remains
in an unrealized loss position for twelve consecutive months unless the amount is insignificant.
 
The aggregate carrying amount of cost-method investments was $11,368,000
and $14,766,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which included the Federal Home Loan Bank stock discussed above. The
Company determined that none of its cost-method investments were impaired at either year end.
 
The book values and approximate fair values of investment securities
at December 31, 2011, by contractual maturity, are summarized in the table below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

                Tabular disclosure of investments in certain debt and equity securities (and certain other trading assets) which include all debt and equity securities (other than those equity securities accounted for under the equity or cost methods of accounting) with readily determinable fair values. Other trading assets include assets that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and held for trading purposes.  A debt security represents a creditor relationship with an enterprise that is in the form of a security. Debt securities include, among other items, US Treasury securities, US government securities, municipal securities, corporate bonds, convertible debt, commercial paper, and all securitized debt instruments. An equity security represents an ownership interest in an enterprise or the right to acquire or dispose of an ownership interest in an enterprise at fixed or determinable prices. Equity securities include, among other things, common stock, certain preferred stock, warrant rights, call options, and put options, but do not include convertible debt. An entity may opt to provide the reader with additional narrative text to better understand the nature of investments in debt and equity securities (and other trading assets).

        Equity-Based Compensation Plans
        
Note 15. Equity-Based Compensation Plans
  
At December 31, 2011, the Company had the following equity-based
compensation plans: the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan, the First Bancorp 2004 Stock Option Plan, the First Bancorp 1994 Stock
Option Plan, and one plan that was assumed from an acquired entity. The Companys shareholders approved all equity-based
compensation plans, except for those assumed from acquired companies. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan became effective upon
the approval of shareholders on May 2, 2007. As of December 31, 2011, the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan was the only plan that
had shares available for future grants.
 
The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan is intended to serve as a means
to attract, retain and motivate key employees and directors and to associate the interests of the plans participants with
those of the Company and its shareholders. The First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan allows for both grants of stock options and other
types of equity-based compensation, including stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted performance stock, unrestricted
stock, and performance units.
  
Prior to the June 17, 2008 grant (discussed below), stock option
grants to employees generally had five-year vesting schedules (20% vesting each year) and had been irregular, usually falling into
three categories - 1) to attract and retain new employees, 2) to recognize changes in responsibilities of existing employees, and
3) to periodically reward exemplary performance. Compensation expense associated with these types of grants is recorded pro-ratably
over the vesting period. As it relates to directors, until 2010 the Company had historically granted 2,250 vested stock options
to each of the Companys non-employee directors in June of each year. In June 2011 and 2010, the Company granted 1,414 common
shares and 1,039 common shares, respectively, to each non-employee director, which had approximately the same value as 2,250 stock
options. Compensation expense associated with these director grants is recognized on the date of grant since there are no vesting
conditions.
 
The June 17, 2008 grant of a combination of performance units and
stock options have both performance conditions (earnings per share targets) and service conditions that must be met in order to
vest. The 262,599 stock options and 81,337 performance units represented the maximum number of options and performance units that
could have vested if the Company were to achieve specified maximum goals for earnings per share during the three annual performance
periods ending on December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010. Up to one-third of the total number of options and performance units granted
were subject to vesting annually as of December 31 of each year beginning in 2010, if (1) the Company achieved specific earnings
per share (EPS) goals during the corresponding performance period and (2) the executive or key employee continued employment for
a period of two years beyond the corresponding performance period. Compensation expense for this grant was recorded over the various
service periods based on the estimated number of options and performance units that were probable to vest. No compensation cost
is recognized for awards that do not vest and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed. The Company did not
achieve the minimum earnings per share performance goal for 2008 or 2010, and thus two-thirds of the above grant was permanently
forfeited. As a result of the significant acquisition gain realized in June 2009 related to a failed bank acquisition, the Company
achieved the EPS goal for 2009 and the related awards fully vested on December 31, 2011 for each grantee that remained employed
through that date. The Company recorded compensation expense of $299,000 in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011 related to the vesting
of these awards.
 
The Company granted long-term restricted shares of common stock
to senior executives on December 11, 2009 and February 24, 2011, with vesting terms in accordance with the minimum rules for long-term
equity grants for companies participating in the U.S. Treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). These rules require
that the vesting of the stock be tied to repayment of the financial assistance, with a two year minimum vesting period. The Company
originally projected the repayment to occur five years after the date of the TARP issuance, and thus the amortization schedule
for the expense was based on a repayment date of January 9, 2014. However, the Company redeemed 100% of the TARP preferred stock
on September 1, 2011. Therefore, the Company recast the amortization schedule for both grants to be based on the vesting date two
years after the grant. The total compensation expense associated with the December 11, 2009 grant was $398,000 and was being initially
amortized over a four-year period at approximately $100,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2009 grant fully vested on
December 11, 2011. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $298,000 for 2011. The
total compensation expense associated with the February 24, 2011 grant was $105,500 and was being initially amortized over a three-year
period at approximately $35,000 per year. Due to the TARP repayment, the 2011 grant will fully vest on February 24, 2013. Accordingly,
the Company accelerated the expense amortization and recorded a total of $42,000 in 2011. See Note 19 for further information related
to the Companys participation in the TARP.
 
Under the terms of the Predecessor Plans and the First Bancorp 2007
Equity Plan, options can have a term of no longer than ten years, and all options granted thus far under these plans have had a
term of ten years. The Companys options provide for immediate vesting if there is a change in control (as defined in the
plans).
 
At December 31, 2011, there were 489,062 options outstanding related
to the three First Bancorp plans, with exercise prices ranging from $14.35 to $22.12. At December 31, 2011, there were 906,268
shares remaining available for grant under the First Bancorp 2007 Equity Plan. The Company also has a stock option plan as a result
of a corporate acquisition. At December 31, 2011, there were 4,788 stock options outstanding in connection with the acquired plan,
with option prices ranging from $10.66 to $15.22.
 
The Company issues new shares of common stock when options are exercised.
 
The Company measures the fair value of each option award on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company determines the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option
pricing model as follows: the risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant;
the dividend yield is based on the Companys dividend yield at the time of the grant (subject to adjustment if the dividend
yield on the grant date is not expected to approximate the dividend yield over the expected life of the option); the volatility
factor is based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock (subject to adjustment if future volatility is reasonably
expected to differ from the past); and the weighted-average expected life is based on the historical behavior of employees related
to exercises, forfeitures and cancellations.
 
The Companys equity grants for the year ended December 31,
2011 were the issuance of 1) 7,259 shares of long-term restricted stock to certain senior executives on February 24, 2011, at a
fair market value of $14.54 per share, which was the closing price of the Companys common stock on that date, and 2) 21,210
shares of common stock to non-employee directors on June 1, 2011 (1,414 shares per director), at a fair market value of $11.39
per share, which was the closing price of the Companys common stock on that date.
 
The Companys only equity grants for the year ended December
31, 2010 were the issuance of 15,585 shares of common stock to non-employee directors on June 1, 2010 (1,039 shares per director).
The fair market value of the Companys common stock on the grant date was $15.51 per share, which was the closing price of
the Companys common stock on that date.
 
The per share weighted-average fair value of options granted during
2009 was $6.06 on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Company recorded total stock-based compensation expense of $905,000,
$640,000 and $449,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Of the $905,000 in expense that was recorded
in 2011, approximately $242,000 related to the June 1, 2011 director grants, which is classified as other operating expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining $663,000 in expense relates the employee grants discussed above and is
recorded as salaries expense. Stock based compensation is reflected as an adjustment to cash flows from operating
activities on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company recognized $353,000, $250,000, and $180,000
of income tax benefits related to stock based compensation expense in the income statement for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively.
 
As noted above, certain of the Companys stock option grants
contain terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service
period. The Company has elected to recognize compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense is based on the estimated number of stock options
and awards that will ultimately vest. Over the past five years, there have only been minimal amounts of forfeitures, and therefore
the Company assumes that all options granted without performance conditions will become vested.

As discussed above, the Company granted 81,337 performance units
to 19 senior officers on June 17, 2008. Each performance unit represents the right to acquire one share of the Companys
common stock upon satisfaction of the vesting conditions (discussed above). The fair market value of the Companys common
stock on the grant date was $16.53 per share. One-third of this grant was forfeited on December 31, 2008 and another one-third
was forfeited on December 31, 2010 because the Company failed to meet the minimum performance goal required for vesting. Also,
as discussed above, the Company granted 29,267 and 7,259 long-term restricted shares of common stock to certain senior executives
on December 11, 2009 and February 24, 2011, respectively.

Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
The following is a summary of the gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization of amortized intangible assets as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 and the carrying amount of unamortized
intangible assets as of those same dates. In 2011, the Company recorded a core deposit premium intangible of $277,000 in connection
with the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the
related deposits of seven years.

A portion of the annual change in the net
deferred tax asset relates to unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale. The related 2011 and 2010 deferred
tax expense (benefit) of approximately $554,000 and $251,000 respectively, has been recorded directly to shareholders equity.
Additionally, a portion of the annual change in the net deferred tax asset relates to pension adjustments. The related 2011 and
2010 deferred tax expense (benefit) of ($2,912,000) and ($688,000), respectively, has been recorded directly to shareholders
equity. Purchase acquisitions also increased the net deferred tax asset by approximately $4,005,000 in 2011. The balance of the
2011 increase in the net deferred tax asset of $3,928,000 is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit, and the balance of the
2010 increase in the net deferred tax asset of $24,200,000 is reflected as a deferred income tax benefit in the consolidated statement
of income.
 
The valuation allowances for 2011 and 2010
relate primarily to state net operating loss carryforwards. It is managements belief that the realization of the remaining
net deferred tax assets is more likely than not.
 
The Company had no significant uncertain
tax positions, and thus no reserve for uncertain tax positions has been recorded. Additionally, the Company determined that it
has no material unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect the effective tax rate. The Companys general policy
is to record tax penalties and interest as a component of other operating expenses.
 
The Companys tax returns are subject
to income tax audit by federal and state agencies beginning with the year 2008.
 
Retained earnings at December 31, 2011
and 2010 includes approximately $6,869,000 representing pre-1988 tax bad debt reserve base year amounts for which no deferred income
tax liability has been provided since these reserves are not expected to reverse or may never reverse. Circumstances that would
require an accrual of a portion or all of this unrecorded tax liability are a reduction in qualifying loan levels relative to the
end of 1987, failure to meet the definition of a bank, dividend payments in excess of accumulated tax earnings and profits, or
other distributions in dissolution, liquidation or redemption of the Banks stock.

In the normal course of the Companys business, there are
various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial
statements. The following table presents the Companys outstanding loan commitments at December 31, 2011.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had $7.1 million and
$7.5 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. The Company has no carrying amount for these standby letters
of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is a guarantee made on behalf of the Companys
customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit
are generally for terms for one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of
the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The
maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) the Company could be required to make under the guarantees in the event
of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount
of the standby letter of credit. In the event that the Company is required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already
executed with the customer, is triggered which provides repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, the Company
has had to honor several insignificant standby letters of credit, which have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any
loss to the Company. Management expects any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.
 
The Company is not involved in any legal proceedings which, in managements
opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.
 
The Bank grants primarily commercial
and installment loans to customers throughout its market area, which consists of Anson, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Buncombe,
Cabarrus, Carteret, Chatham, Columbus, Dare, Davidson, Duplin, Guilford, Harnett, Iredell, Lee, Montgomery, Moore, New Hanover,
Onslow, Randolph, Richmond, Robeson, Rockingham, Rowan, Scotland, Stanly and Wake Counties in North Carolina, Chesterfield, Dillon,
Florence and Horry Counties in South Carolina, and Montgomery, Pulaski, Washington and Wythe Counties in Virginia. The real estate
loan portfolio can be affected by the condition of the local real estate market. The commercial and installment loan portfolios
can be affected by local economic conditions.
 
The Companys loan portfolio is not concentrated in loans
to any single borrower or to a relatively small number of borrowers. Additionally, management is not aware of any concentrations
of loans to classes of borrowers or industries that would be similarly affected by economic conditions.
 
In addition to monitoring potential concentrations of loans to particular
borrowers or groups of borrowers, industries and geographic regions, the Company monitors exposure to credit risk that could arise
from potential concentrations of lending products and practices such as loans that subject borrowers to substantial payment increases
(e.g. principal deferral periods, loans with initial interest-only periods, etc), and loans with high loan-to-value ratios. Additionally,
there are industry practices that could subject the Company to increased credit risk should economic conditions change over the
course of a loans life. For example, the Company makes variable rate loans and fixed rate principal-amortizing loans with
maturities prior to the loan being fully paid (i.e. balloon payment loans). These loans are underwritten and monitored to manage
the associated risks. The Company has determined that there is no concentration of credit risk associated with its lending policies
or practices.
 
The Companys investment portfolio consists principally of
obligations of government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, corporate
bonds, FHLB stock and general obligation municipal securities. The following are the fair values at December 31, 2011 of available
for sale and held to maturity securities to any one issuer/guarantor that exceed $2.0 million, with such amounts representing the
maximum amount of credit risk that the Company would incur if the issuer did not repay the obligation.

Until February 27, 2009, the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as
borrowings were repaid. On February 27, 2009, the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when
loans are repaid. Instead, they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis. During
the second half of 2010, the FHLB repurchased $1.8 million of stock from the Company. During 2011, the FHLB repurchased $4.4 million
of stock from the Company.
 
The Company places its deposits and correspondent accounts with
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Bank, and Bank of America and sells its federal funds to Bank of America.
At December 31, 2011, the Company had deposits in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta totaling $17.6 million, deposits of $117.6
million in the Federal Reserve Bank, and deposits of $54.9 million in Bank of America and federal funds sold to Bank of America
of $0.6 million. None of the deposits held at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve Bank, or the federal funds
sold to Bank of America are FDIC-insured, however the Federal Reserve Bank is a government entity and therefore risk of loss is
minimal. The deposits held at Bank of America are fully guaranteed by the FDIC under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
which guarantees, until December 31, 2013, an unlimited amount of non-interest bearing deposits.

Note 2. Acquisitions  Completed and Pending
 
The Company did not complete
any significant acquisitions during 2010. The Company completed the acquisitions described below during 2009 and 2011. The results
of each acquired company/branch are included in the Companys results beginning on its respective acquisition date.
 
(1) On June 19, 2009, the Bank entered
into a purchase and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for Cooperative Bank,
in Wilmington, North Carolina. Earlier that day, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks issued an order requiring the closure
of Cooperative Bank and appointing the FDIC as receiver. According to the terms of the agreement, the Bank acquired all deposits
(except certain brokered deposits) and borrowings, and substantially all of the assets of Cooperative Bank and its subsidiary,
Lumina Mortgage. All deposits were assumed by the Bank with no losses to any depositor.
 
Cooperative Bank operated through twenty-one branches in North Carolina
and three branches in South Carolina, with assets totaling approximately $959 million and approximately 200 employees.
 
The loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two
loss share agreements between the FDIC and the Bank, which affords the Bank significant loss protection. Under the loss share agreements,
the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million and 95% of losses in excess of that
amount. The term for loss sharing on residential real estate loans is ten years, while the term for loss sharing on non-residential
real estate loans is five years in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries. The reimbursable losses from
the FDIC are based on the book value of the relevant loan as determined by the FDIC at the date of the transaction. New loans made
after that date are not covered by the loss share agreements.
 
The Bank received a $123 million discount on the assets acquired
and paid no deposit premium. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with relevant
accounting guidance. The purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values,
and identifiable intangible assets were recorded at fair value. Fair values were subject to refinement for up to one year after
the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values became available. The Company recorded
an estimated receivable from the FDIC in the amount of $185.1 million as of June 30, 2009, which represented the FDICs portion
of the losses that were expected to be incurred and reimbursed to the Company.
 
An acquisition gain totaling $67.9 million resulted from the acquisition
and is included as a component of noninterest income in the Companys statement of income. In the Companys filings
for the second quarter 2009, this gain was reported as being $53.8 million. During the third and fourth quarters of 2009, the Company
obtained third-party appraisals for the majority of Cooperative Banks collateral dependent problem loans. Overall, the appraised
values were higher than the Companys original estimates made as of the acquisition date. In addition, during the third and
fourth quarters of 2009, the Company received payoffs related to certain loans for which losses had been anticipated. Accordingly,
as required by accounting guidance, the Company retrospectively adjusted the fair value of the loans acquired for these factors,
which resulted in a higher gain being reflected in the second quarter of 2009.
  
The statement of net assets acquired as of June 19, 2009 and the
resulting gain (as adjusted) are presented in the following table.

Explanation of Fair Value Adjustments
 
     
    (a)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was necessary as of the acquisition date to write down Cooperative Banks book value of loans to the estimated fair value as a result of future expected loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (b)
    This estimated fair value adjustment represents the value of the core deposit base assumed in the acquisition based on a study performed by an independent consulting firm.  This amount was recorded by the Company as an identifiable intangible asset and will be amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average life of the core deposit base, which is estimated to be 8 years.
     
     
     
     
    (c)
    This estimated fair value adjustment represents the amount that the Company will receive from the FDIC under its loss share agreements as a result of future loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (d)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was necessary to write down Cooperative Banks book value of foreclosed real estate properties to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.
     
     
     
     
    (e)
    These estimated fair value adjustments are other immaterial adjustments made to acquired assets and assumed liabilities to reflect fair value.
     
     
     
     
    (f)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was recorded because the weighted average interest rate of Cooperative Banks time deposits exceeded the cost of similar wholesale funding at the time of the acquisition.  This amount was amortized to reduce interest expense on a declining basis over the average life of the portfolio of approximately 15 months.
     
     
     
     
    (g)
    This estimated fair value adjustment was recorded because the interest rates of Cooperative Banks fixed rate borrowings exceeded current interest rates on similar borrowings.  This amount was realized shortly after the acquisition by prepaying the borrowings at a premium, and thus there will be no future amortization related to this adjustment.
  
The operating results of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2009 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities since the acquisition date of June 19, 2009.
 
(2) On January 21, 2011, the Bank entered into
a loss share purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC, as receiver for The Bank of Asheville, Asheville, North Carolina.
Earlier that day, the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks issued an order for the closure of The Bank of Asheville and appointed
the FDIC as receiver. According to the terms of the agreement, First Bank acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities
of The Bank of Asheville. All deposits were assumed by First Bank with no losses to any depositor.
 
The Bank of Asheville operated through five branches in Asheville,
North Carolina with total assets of approximately $198 million and 50 employees.
 
Substantially all of the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased
are covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and First Bank, which afford First Bank significant loss protection. Under
the loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses. The term for loss sharing
on residential real estate loans is ten years, while the term for loss sharing on non-residential real estate loans is five years
in respect to losses and eight years in respect to loss recoveries. The reimbursable losses from the FDIC are based on the book
value of the relevant loan as determined by the FDIC at the date of the transaction. New loans made after that date are not covered
by the loss share agreements.
 
First Bank received a $23.9 million discount on the assets acquired
and paid no deposit premium. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with relevant
accounting guidance. The statement of net assets acquired as of January 21, 2011 and the resulting gain are presented in the following
table. The purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values, and identifiable
intangible assets were recorded at fair value. The Company recorded an estimated receivable from the FDIC in the amount of $42.2
million, which represents the fair value of the FDICs portion of the losses that are expected to be incurred and reimbursed
to the Company.
 
An acquisition gain totaling $10.2 million resulted from the acquisition
and is included as a component of noninterest income in the statement of income. The amount of the gain is equal to the amount
by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed.
 
The statement of net assets acquired as of January 21, 2011 and
the resulting gain that was recorded are presented in the following table.

Explanation of Fair Value Adjustments
 
     
    (a)
    This estimated adjustment is necessary as of the acquisition date to write down The Bank of Ashevilles book value of loans to the estimated fair value as a result of future expected loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (b)
    This fair value adjustment represents the value of the core deposit base assumed in the acquisition based on a study performed by an independent consulting firm.  This amount was recorded by the Company as an identifiable intangible asset and will be amortized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the average life of the core deposit base, which is estimated to be seven years.
     
     
     
     
    (c)
    This adjustment is the estimated fair value of the amount that the Company expects to receive from the FDIC under its loss share agreements as a result of future loan losses.
     
     
     
     
    (d)
    This is the estimated adjustment necessary to write down The Bank of Ashevilles book value of foreclosed real estate properties to their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.
     
     
     
     
    (e)
    This is an immaterial adjustment made to reflect fair value.
     
     
     
     
    (f)
    This fair value adjustment was recorded because the weighted average interest rate of The Bank of Ashevilles time deposits exceeded the cost of similar wholesale funding at the time of the acquisition.  This amount will be amortized to reduce interest expense on a declining basis over the life of the portfolio of approximately 48 months.
     
     
     
     
    (g)
    This fair value adjustment was recorded because the interest rates of The Bank of Ashevilles fixed rate borrowings exceeded current interest rates on similar borrowings.  This amount was realized shortly after the acquisition by prepaying the borrowings at a premium and thus there will be no future amortization related to this adjustment.
     
     
     
     
    (h)
    This adjustment relates primarily to the estimate of what the Company will owe to the FDIC at the conclusion of the loss share agreements based on a pre-established formula set forth in those agreements that is based on total expected losses in relation to the amount of the discount bid.
 
The operating results of the Company for the year
ended December 31, 2011 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for the period subsequent
to the acquisition date of January 21, 2011. Due primarily to the significant amount of fair value adjustments and the FDIC loss
share agreements now in place, historical results of The Bank of Asheville are not believed to be relevant to the Companys
results, and thus no pro forma information is presented.
 
(3) At December 31, 2011, the Company had one
pending acquisition. On October 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement (The Agreement)
with Waccamaw Bankshares, Inc., and its subsidiary, Waccamaw Bank. The Agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches
from Waccamaw Bank, which includes assuming all deposits, selected performing loans, and all premises and equipment. Deposits total
approximately $180 million (unaudited) and loans total approximately $98 million (unaudited).
 
The Agreement provides for the deposits to be purchased at a premium
that varies by account type. The estimated blended premium is approximately 1.5% of total deposits (unaudited).
 
The Agreement provides for loans to be purchased at par (the amount
of principal outstanding and interest receivable) and for premises and equipment to be purchased at net book value. Approximately
$31 million of the $98 million (unaudited) in loans being acquired are subject to a provision in the Agreement allowing First Bank
to put the loans back to Waccamaw Bank at par value for any reason within 20 months following the closing date of the transaction.
The Agreement is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. No assurance can be provided that this Agreement
will be approved.

        Note 19. Participation in the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase
Program and Small Business Lending Fund
 
U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program
 
On January 9, 2009, the Company completed the sale of $65 million
of Series A preferred stock to the United States Treasury Department (Treasury) under the Treasurys Capital Purchase Program.
The program was designed to attract broad participation by healthy banking institutions to help stabilize the financial system
and increase lending for the benefit of the U.S. economy.
 
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received
(i) 65,000 shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share and (ii) a
warrant to purchase 616,308 shares of the Companys common stock, no par value, in exchange for $65 million. As discussed
below, the Company redeemed this preferred stock in the third quarter of 2011 and repurchased the common stock warrant in the fourth
quarter of 2011.
 
The Series A preferred stock qualified as Tier 1 capital and its
terms required cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% for the first five years, and 9% thereafter.
 
The warrant had a 10-year term and became immediately exercisable
upon its issuance, with an exercise price equal to $15.82 per share.
 
  
The Company allocated the $65 million in proceeds to the preferred
stock and the common stock warrant based on their relative fair values. To determine the fair value of the preferred stock, the
Company used a discounted cash flow model that assumed redemption of the preferred stock at the end of year five. The discount
rate utilized was 13% and the estimated fair value was determined to be $36.2 million. The fair value of the common stock warrant
was estimated to be $2.8 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
 
 
    Expected dividend yield
     
     
    4.83

    Risk-free interest rate
     
     
    2.48

    35.00
    %
    Weighted average fair value
     
    $
    4.47
     
 
The aggregate fair value result for both the preferred stock and
the common stock warrant was determined to be $39.0 million, with 7% of this aggregate total attributable to the warrant and
93% attributable to the preferred stock. Therefore, the $65 million issuance was allocated with $60.4 million being assigned to
the preferred stock and $4.6 million being assigned to the common stock warrant.
 
The $4.6 million difference between the $65 million face value of
the preferred stock and the $60.4 million allocated to it upon issuance was recorded as a discount on the preferred stock. Until
the Company redeemed the preferred stock in the third quarter of 2011 (discussed below), the $4.6 million discount was being
accreted, using the effective interest method, as a reduction in net income available to common shareholders over a five-year period
at approximately $0.8 million to $1.0 million per year.
 
On September 1, 2011, the Company redeemed the 65,000 shares of
outstanding Series A preferred stock from the U.S. Treasury for a redemption price of $65 million, plus unpaid dividends. The Company
funded the majority of this transaction by simultaneously issuing Series B preferred stock to the Treasury as part of the Small
Business Lending Fund (see below).
 
Due to the redemption of the preferred stock, the Company accreted
the remaining discount of $2.3 million during the third quarter of 2011, which resulted in total discount accretion for 2011 of
$2.9 million, which compared to $0.9 million recorded in 2010 and $0.8 million in 2009. Preferred stock discount accretion is deducted
from net income in computing Net income available to common shareholders.
 
In November 2011, the Company repurchased the outstanding common
stock warrant from the Treasury for $1.50 per common share, or a total of $924,000.
 
Small Business Lending Fund
 
On September 1, 2011, the Company completed the sale of $63.5 million
of Series B preferred stock to the Secretary of the Treasury under the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). The fund was established
under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that was created to encourage lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified
community banks with assets less than $10 billion.
 
Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement, the Treasury received
63,500 shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock with a liquidation value of $1,000 per share, in exchange for $63.5 million.
 
  
The Series B preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital. The dividend
rate, as a percentage of the liquidation amount, can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first 10 quarters during which the
Series B preferred stock is outstanding, based upon changes in the level of Qualified Small Business Lending or QBSL.
For the first nine quarters after issuance, the dividend rate can range from one percent (1%) to five percent (5%) per annum based
upon the increase in QBSL as compared to the baseline. For the two quarters subsequent to the issuance in 2011, the Company paid
a dividend rate of 5%. Based upon an increase in the level of QBSL over the baseline level calculated under the terms of the related
purchase agreement, the dividend rate for the next dividend period (which will end on March 31, 2012) is expected to be 4.8%, subject
to confirmation by Treasury. For the tenth calendar quarter through four and one half years after issuance, the dividend rate will
be fixed at between one percent (1%) and seven percent (7%) based upon the level of QBSL compared to the baseline. After four and
one half years from the issuance, the dividend rate will increase to nine percent (9%). Subject to regulatory approval, the Company
is generally permitted to redeem the Series B preferred shares at par plus unpaid dividends.
 
 
There was no discount recorded related to the SBLF preferred stock
(because no warrants were issued in connection with this preferred stock issuance), and therefore there will be no future amounts
recorded for preferred stock discount accretion.

Note 12. Employee Benefit Plans
 
401(k) Plan . The Company sponsors a retirement savings plan
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who have completed one year of service are eligible to participate
in the plan. New employees, who have met the service requirement, are automatically enrolled in the plan at a 2% deferral rate,
which can be modified by the employee at any time. An eligible employee may contribute up to 15% of annual salary to the plan.
The Company contributes an amount equal to 75% of the first 6% of the employees salary contributed. Participants vest in
Company contributions at the rate of 20% after one year of service, and 20% for each additional year of service, with 100% vesting
after five years of service. The Companys matching contribution expense was $1,198,000, $1,107,000, and $933,000, for the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Additionally, the Company made additional discretionary matching contributions
to the plan of $200,000 in 2009. The Company did not make a discretionary contribution in 2011 or 2010. The Companys matching
and discretionary contributions are made in the form of Company stock, which can be transferred by the employee into other investment
options offered by the plan at any time. Employees are not permitted to invest their own contributions in Company stock.
 
Pension Plan . The Company sponsors a noncontributory defined
benefit retirement plan (the Pension Plan), which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Employees who have attained age 21 and completed one year of service are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. The
Pension Plan provides for a monthly payment, at normal retirement age of 65, equal to one-twelfth of the sum of (i) 0.75% of Final
Average Annual Compensation (5 highest consecutive calendar years earnings out of the last 10 years of employment) multiplied
by the employees years of service not in excess of 40 years, and (ii) 0.65% of Final Average Annual Compensation in excess
of covered compensation multiplied by years of service not in excess of 35 years. Covered compensation
means the average of the social security taxable wage base during the 35 year period ending with the year the employee attains
social security retirement age. Early retirement, with reduced monthly benefits, is available at age 55 after 15 years of service.
The Pension Plan provides for 100% vesting after 5 years of service, and provides for a death benefit to a vested participants
surviving spouse. The costs of benefits under the Pension Plan, which are borne by the Company, are computed actuarially and defrayed
by earnings from the Pension Plans investments. The compensation covered by the Pension Plan includes total earnings before
reduction for contributions to a cash or deferred profit-sharing plan (such as the 401(k) plan described above) and amounts used
to pay group health insurance premiums and includes bonuses (such as amounts paid under the incentive compensation plan). Compensation
for the purposes of the Pension Plan may not exceed statutory limits; such limits were $245,000 in 2011, $245,000 in 2010 and $235,000
in 2009.
 
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company amended the Pension
Plan to prohibit new entrants into the plan.
 
The Companys contributions to the Pension Plan are based
on computations by independent actuarial consultants and are intended to provide the Company with the maximum deduction for income
tax purposes. The contributions are invested to provide for benefits under the Pension Plan. The Company expects that it will contribute
$2,500,000 to the Pension Plan in 2012.
 
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances
of the Pension Plans benefit obligation, as computed by the Companys independent actuarial consultants, and its plan
assets, with the difference between the two amounts representing the funded status of the Pension Plan as of the end of the respective
year.

For each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the
Company used an expected long-term rate-of-return-on-assets assumption of 7.75%. The Company arrived at this rate based primarily
on a third-party investment consulting firms historical analysis of investment returns, which indicated that the mix of
the Pension Plans assets (generally 75% equities and 25% fixed income) can be expected to return approximately 7.75% on
a long term basis.
 
Funds in the Pension Plan are invested in a mix of investment types
in accordance with the Pension Plans investment policy, which is intended to provide an average annual rate of return of
7% to 10%, while maintaining proper diversification. Except for Company stock, all of the Pension Plans assets are invested
in an unaffiliated bank money market account or mutual funds. The investment policy of the Pension Plan does not permit the use
of derivatives, except to the extent that derivatives are used by any of the mutual funds invested in by the Pension Plan. The
following table presents the targeted mix of the Pension Plans assets as of December 31, 2011, as set out by the Plans

The Pension Plans investment strategy contains certain investment
objectives and risks for each permitted investment category. To ensure that risk and return characteristics are consistently followed,
the Pension Plans investments are reviewed at least semi-annually and rebalanced within the acceptable range. Performance
m easurement of the investments employs the use of certain investment category and peer group benchmarks. The investment
category benchmarks as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Each of the investment funds average annualized return over
a three-year period should be within the range of acceptable deviation from the benchmarked index shown above. In addition to the
investment category benchmarks, the Pension Plan also utilizes certain Peer Group benchmarks, based on Morningstar percentile rankings
for each investment category. Funds are generally considered to be underperformers if their category ranking is below the 75 th
percentile for the trailing one-year period; the 50 th percentile for the trailing three-year period; and the 25 th
percentile for the trailing five-year period.
 
The Pension Plan invests in
various investment securities which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market, and credit risks. All of these
risks are monitored and managed by the Company. No significant concentration of risk exists within the plan assets at December
31, 2011.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used
for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
  
     
    -
    Money market fund: valued on the active market on which it is traded; at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
     
    -
    Mutual funds, common stocks: valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
 
 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan . The Company sponsors
a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP) for the benefit of certain senior management executives of the
Company. The purpose of the SERP is to provide additional monthly pension benefits to ensure that each such senior management executive
would receive lifetime monthly pension benefits equal to 3% of his or her final average compensation multiplied by his or her years
of service (maximum of 20 years) to the Company or its subsidiaries, subject to a maximum of 60% of his or her final average compensation.
The amount of a participants monthly SERP benefit is reduced by (i) the amount payable under the Companys qualified
Pension Plan (described above), and (ii) 50% of the participants primary social security benefit. Final average compensation
means the average of the 5 highest consecutive calendar years of earnings during the last 10 years of service prior to termination
of employment. The SERP is an unfunded plan. Payments are made from the general assets of the Company.
 
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balances
of the SERPs benefit obligation, as computed by the Companys independent actuarial consultants:
