  Introductory Note
   
  The Registrant is the depositor under the trust agreements for its various SATURNS Units listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The Units do not represent obligations of or interests in the Depositor. Pursuant to staff administrative positions established in various no-action letters, see e.g. Corporate Asset Backed Corporation (available August 9, 1995), the Registrant is not required to respond to various items of Form 10-K. Such items are designated herein as “Not applicable.”  Distribution reports detailing receipts and distributions by each trust are filed shortly after each distribution date on Form 8-K in lieu of reports on Form 10-Q.

EXHIBIT B
   
  False Claims Act
   
  With respect to paragraph 7 of this certificate, the U.S. Government is conducting a civil investigation under the False Claims Act into whether originators, depositors, servicers, or trustees of residential mortgage-backed securities (“ RMBS
”) trusts submitted false claims for payment by  government purchasers of RMBS by (1) concealing that the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose; (2) charging RMBS trusts for fraudulent loan processing services, including the preparation of fraudulent mortgage assignments; and (3) failing to ensure that the RMBS trusts paid necessary real estate mortgage investment conduit (“ REMIC
”) taxes.  Certain states may be conducting similar investigations.  The investigation may involve RMBS trusts in which current or former Bank of America affiliates, including BAC Home Loans Servicing LP, Bank of America Mortgage Securities, Inc., Countrywide Financial Corporation, and Bank of America, N.A. as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank, served as originator, depositor, servicer, or trustee.  The U.S. government’s investigation is also considering whether participants in RMBS trusts defrauded federal mortgage insurers, including the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development by submitting claims for loan guarantee payments on loans for which the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose.
   
  Investigations under the federal and most state False Claims Acts may be initiated by the applicable government investigative body or by a qui tam 
relator’s filing of a False Claims Act complaint under court seal.  If a qui tam 
relator’s complaint remained under seal, applicable law would restrict our ability to disclose such a fact.
   
  Ocala
   
  Bank of America, National Association is a named party in litigation involving Ocala Funding, LLP.  Information about this litigation is publicly disclosed in Bank of America Corporation’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings.
   
  Fifth Third v. Concord Capital Management et al.
   
  Bank of America, National Association (“ Bank of America
”) was named as a co-defendant in a suit filed in September 2010 by Concord Capital Management LLC and affiliated parties (collectively, “ Concord
”) in the New York State Supreme Court against Bank of America (as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association), Fifth Third Bank (“ Fifth Third
”) and other parties. The suit alleged gross negligence and breach of contract by Bank of America, acting as collateral agent, servicer and, until the transfer of such role to Wilmington Trust Company in February 2009, the trustee, in connection with a life insurance premium-financing loan facility known as “Ultra”, established by Concord and financed by Fifth Third.
   
  In November 2011, Fifth Third filed an amended complaint in Illinois State Court naming Concord, Bank of America and certain other parties, as defendants. Fifth Third’s lawsuit alleges breach of contract and gross negligence by Bank of America based on assertions about Bank of America’s duties substantially similar to those previously made by Concord in New York State Court.
   
   
   
  Bank of America’s motion to dismiss against Concord was granted on December 5, 2011. The Fifth Third lawsuit is ongoing.
   
  Nightingale Properties, LLC et al. vs. Bank of America, N.A., et al.
   
  Bank of America was named as a co-defendant with CW Capital Asset Management LLC (“ CWC
”) in suits filed in Tennessee State Court (in February 2011) New York State Court (in August 2011) and Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York (in December 2011) by the Nightingale Group, LLC and related parties (collectively, “ Nightingale
”). Each of the actions arose as a consequence of the default of four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust, 2008-C1, and the filing by CWC on behalf of Bank of America of a collection suit in Tennessee against Nightingale and its owners/guarantors, which resulted in a receivership.
   
  The Tennessee and New York State complaints allege libel by CWC, as servicer, purportedly acting as agent of Bank of America, as trustee with respect to the LB-UBS Trust, arising from the publication by CWC of certain statements relating to the guarantee given by Nightingale in support of payment on the four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Trust. The Federal District Court complaint alleges breach of contract, intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, fraud, promissory estoppel and a RICO claim against CWC and Bank of America.

  INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT’S REPORT
  ON APPLYING AGREED-UPON PROCEDURES
   
   
  MS Structured Asset Corp.
  1585 Broadway
  New York, NY 10036
   
   
  With respect to the Structured Asset Trust Unit Repackagings 2004-2 (“SATURNS Trust 2004-2”), we have performed the procedures listed below, which were agreed to by MS Structured Asset Corp. (the “Depositor”) solely to assist the Depositor in evaluating the Trustees’ (U.S. Bank National Association,  and Bank of America, National Association, each for the respective periods during which they acted as Trustee) assertions that the administration of the Trust Property of SATURNS Trust 2004-2 (the “Trust”) was conducted in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement relating thereto for the year ended December 31, 2011.  This agreed-upon procedures engagement was performed in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  The sufficiency of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the specified user of this report, the Depositor.  Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.
   
  Pursuant to the foregoing, for SATURNS Trust 2004-2, we:
   
      1.  
 
  Calculated the semi-annual interest payment, on the underlying security as defined in the prospectus.
 
 
 
   
      2.  
 
  Verified that interest payments on the underlying security were received on the scheduled date for payment thereof.
 
 
 
   
      3.  
 
  Calculated the semi-annual interest distributions and principal distributions, if any, on the Class A and Class B units.
 
 
 
   
      4.  
 
  Verified that distributions on Class A and Class B units were made on the scheduled dates for distribution thereof.
 
 
 
       
 
     
    
 
     
 
 
   -2-
   
   
      5.  
 
  Verified Trust property amounts and balances.
 
 
 
   
      6.  
 
  Verified that the amounts of any units redeemed, upon receipt of redemption payments or notices of exercise of warrants, matched amounts of the relevant redemptions and warrant exercise amounts notified to the Trustees.
 
 
 
   
      7.  
 
  Verified that the proceeds of redemptions, exercise of warrants and liquidation of underlying securities following any underlying security default were applied within the time and in the manner provided in the Trust Agreement.
 
 
 
   
      8.  
 
  Verified that reports on Form 8-K were filed by the Trustees with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before the fifteenth day following each payment date for the Class A and Class B units.
 
 
 
   
  We were not engaged to, and did not, perform an examination, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion on the Trustees’ assertions.  Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.
   
  We are independent public accountants with respect to the Trustees and the Trust, as defined under the Code of Professional Ethics of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
