ITEM 1.	BUSINESS
   
  Oneida Financial Corp.
   
  Oneida Financial Corp. (sometimes herein referred to as the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation. On July 7, 2010, Oneida Financial Corp. completed its conversion from the mutual holding company structure and the related public offering and is now a stock holding company that is fully owned by the public.  As a result of the conversion, the mutual holding company and former mid-tier holding company were merged into Oneida Financial Corp.  The Oneida Savings Bank (“Oneida Savings Bank”) is 100% owned by the Company and the Company is 100% owned by public stockholders.  The Company sold a total of 3,937,500 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in the offering, including 157,500 shares to the Oneida Savings Bank employee stock ownership plan.  All shares were sold at a price of $8.00 per share, raising $31.5 million in gross proceeds.  Conversion related expenses of $2.5 million were offset against the gross proceeds, resulting in $29.0 million of net proceeds.  Concurrent with the completion of the offering, shares of Oneida Financial Corp., a federal corporation, common stock owned by public stockholders were exchanged for 0.9136 shares of the Company’s common stock.  
   
  The Company’s only significant assets are our investment in Oneida Savings Bank and the portion of the net proceeds of the offering retained by the Company. At December 31, 2011, Oneida Financial Corp. had consolidated assets of $663.7 million, total deposits of $550.6 million, and stockholders’ equity of $88.0 million.
   
  Oneida Financial Corp.’s executive offices are located at 182 Main Street, Oneida, New York 13421. Its telephone number at this address is (315) 363-2000 and its website address is www.oneidafinancial.com. Information on this website is not and should not be considered to be a part of this annual report and Form 10-K.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank
   
  Oneida Savings Bank is a New York chartered savings bank headquartered in Oneida, New York. Oneida Savings Bank was originally founded in 1866 as a mutual (meaning no stockholders) savings bank. In 1998, Oneida Savings Bank converted to a New York chartered stock savings bank and reorganized from the mutual to the two-tiered mutual holding company form of organization. Since 1998 the Bank has grown its traditional community banking franchise organically and through acquisitions of banks and nonbank companies that offer insurance sales, financial services, employee benefits consulting and other risk management products and services. The expansion into insurance and other financial services businesses has enabled Oneida Savings Bank to evolve from a traditional savings bank to a full-service financial services organization.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Oneida Savings Bank is a community bank engaged primarily in the business of accepting deposits from customers through its main office and 11 full service branch offices and using those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings to make one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans and to invest in mortgage-backed and other securities. In November 2011, Oneida Savings Bank opened its eleventh full service branch office located in Rome, New York. Municipal deposit banking services are provided through a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary, The State Bank of Chittenango. Oneida Savings Bank also sells insurance and other commercial services and products through Bailey & Haskell Associates, Inc., its wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary, and provides employee benefits consulting services through Benefit Consulting Group, Inc., its wholly owned consulting services

  subsidiary. In addition, Oneida Savings Bank provides risk management services to help mitigate and prevent work related injuries through its wholly owned subsidiary Workplace Health Solutions, Inc. Oneida Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank’s executive offices are located at 182 Main Street, Oneida, New York 13421. Its telephone number at this address is (315) 363-2000 and its website address is www.oneidabank.com. Information on this website is not and should not be considered to be a part of this annual report and Form 10-K.
   
  The State Bank of Chittenango
   
  The State Bank of Chittenango is a New York chartered limited purpose commercial bank headquartered in Chittenango, New York. Oneida Savings Bank acquired State Bank of Chittenango in 2002 and retained the municipal banking operations of the bank in a limited purpose wholly owned subsidiary. New York State law prohibits a savings bank from directly soliciting and servicing public funds (deposits of counties, cities, towns, school districts, etc.). Holding State Bank of Chittenango as a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary has enabled us to offer municipal deposit banking services throughout our market area. At December 31, 2011, State Bank of Chittenango held $149.6 million in assets, consisting primarily of U.S. Government obligations, mortgage-backed securities and tax exempt securities. The investment securities maintained at State Bank of Chittenango are used to collateralize $118.9 million in municipal deposits. All disclosures in this annual report and Form 10-K relating to Oneida Financial Corp.’s investments and deposits include the investments and deposits that are held by State Bank of Chittenango.

All of the acquired insurance agencies were merged into Bailey & Haskell Associates. The combination of acquired agencies and organic growth has resulted in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 of $11.6 million, an increase of 10.5% or $1.1 million, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

  Market Area
   
  We conduct business from our headquarters and ten full service branch offices throughout Madison and Oneida Counties and one full service branch office in Onondaga County in New York. Our primary lending area is Madison and Oneida Counties in New York and the surrounding counties and most of our deposit customers reside in the same area. The City of Oneida is located approximately 30 miles east of Syracuse and 20 miles west of Utica. Our market area is characterized as rural and serves as a bedroom community to the cities of Syracuse and Utica, New York. The economy in our market area is relatively diverse with health care, college/university, financial/insurance and tourism/recreation being the most prominent sectors as well as light manufacturing and technology related industries. The largest employers in our market area includes Oneida Nation’s Turning Stone Casino and Resort, Oneida Healthcare Center and other local and regional medical facilities, Colgate University and Morrisville College. There are also many small to mid-sized businesses that employ fewer than 100 persons and support the local economy.

  Our primary market area has remained a stable banking market. As of December 2011, the unemployment rates in Madison, Oneida and Onondaga Counties in New York were 8.3%, 7.9% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to the States of New York average of 8.0% and the national average of 8.3%, according to the United States Department of Labor. As of June 30, 2010, median household income levels ranged from $46,569 to $53,357 in the three counties where we maintain branch offices.
   
  Competition
   
  Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Moreover, credit unions which offer substantially the same services as we offer are not subject to federal or state income taxation. Trends toward consolidation of the financial services industry and the removal of restrictions on interstate branching and banking powers may make it more difficult for smaller institutions such as Oneida Savings Bank to compete effectively with large national and regional banking institutions. Our profitability depends upon the ability to successfully compete in our market area.
   
  Lending Activities
   
  General.
 
Our principal lending activity has been the origination for retention in our portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate located within our primary market area. As a result of the continuation of relatively low market interest rates in recent periods, borrowers have shown a preference for fixed-rate loans. Consequently, in recent periods we have originated more fixed-rate one-to-four family loans for resale in the secondary market, without recourse and on a servicing retained basis. In order to complement our traditional emphasis of one-to-four family residential real estate lending, management has sought to increase the number of higher yielding commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans. To a limited extent, we will originate loans secured by multi-family properties.

       One-to-four family Residential Loans.
 
One of our primary lending activities is the origination of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans secured by property located in our primary lending area. Generally, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are made in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property. However, we will originate one-to-four family loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 97%, provided the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance. Fixed-rate loans are originated for terms of up to 30 years. One-to-four family fixed-rate loans are offered with a monthly payment feature. We do not originate and have not originated sub-prime, Alt-A, negative amortization or other higher risk residential mortgage loans.
   
  We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate one-to-four family loans. As a result of the continued low interest rate environment during the past year, a greater percentage of our one-to-four family loan originations consisted of fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans. Our practice in recent years has been to sell in the secondary market substantially all of our fixed-rate one-to-four family loan originations on a servicing retained basis without recourse to Oneida Savings Bank. Currently, we have no intention of changing our practice of selling substantially all of our fixed-rate loan originations, although we may determine to change this practice in the future. In a rising interest rate environment, we expect that a greater percentage of our loan originations will consist of adjustable-rate loans, which we generally retain in our portfolio. At December 31, 2011, loans serviced by Oneida Savings Bank for others totaled $132.8 million. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we sold $25.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively in fixed-rate one-to-four family loans. As of December 31, 2011 we had $4.5 million of mortgage loan forward sale commitments. The fair value of these commitments is not material.
   
  The interest rate on ARM loans is indexed to the one year Treasury bill rate. Our ARM loans currently provide for maximum rate adjustments of 200 basis points per year and either 500 or 600 basis points over the term of the loan depending on the length of the adjustable portion of the loan. In the current rate environment the fully indexed equivalent loan rate is less than the initial interest rate on the ARM loans. Residential ARM loans amortize over a maximum term of up to 30 years. In addition to one year ARM loans, we offer certain hybrid ARM loans which provide for an initial fixed term of three or five years and then are converted into a one year ARM loan after the fixed time period. ARM loans are originated for retention in our portfolio.
   
  ARM loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing, but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the underlying required periodic payments by the borrower increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustment of the contractual interest rate is also limited by the maximum periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment permitted by the terms of the ARM loans, and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. Decreasing interest rates could result in a downward adjustment of the contractual interest rates resulting in lower interest income. At December 31, 2011, 18.9% of our loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential loans with adjustable interest rates.
   
  All one-to-four family residential mortgage loans originated by Oneida Savings Bank include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.
   
  At December 31, 2011, approximately $88.9 million, or 30.8% of our loan portfolio, consisted of one-to-four family residential loans.

  Home Equity Loans.
 We offer home equity loans that are secured by the borrower’s primary residence. We offer a home equity line of credit under which the borrower is permitted to draw on the home equity line of credit during the first ten years after it is originated and repay the outstanding balance over a term not to exceed 25 years from the date the line of credit is originated. The interest rates on home equity lines of credit adjust monthly at a margin over the prime interest rate. We also offer a home equity product providing for a fixed-rate of interest. Both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate home equity loans are underwritten under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family fixed-rate loans. Fixed-rate home equity loans are originated with terms up to ten years. Home equity loans may be underwritten with a loan to value ratio of 90% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. The maximum amount of a home equity loan may not exceed $1.0 million unless approved by the Board of Directors. 
We generally require an appraisal on the property securing loans in excess of $75,000 at the time of the loan application (but not thereafter) in order to determine the value of the property securing the home equity loans. We utilize alternative methods in determining the value of properties of loans less than $75,000 such as a limited appraisal or review of tax bills. At December 31, 2011 the outstanding balance of home equity loans totaled $45.0 million, or 15.6% of our loan portfolio.
   
  Commercial Real Estate Loans.
 
At December 31, 2011, $77.5 million, or 26.8% of the total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and multi-family loans. Commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans are secured by office buildings, medical facilities, mixed-use properties, religious facilities, other commercial properties and multi-family residential properties. We originate adjustable rate commercial mortgage loans with terms of up to 20 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of commercial real estate loans is 80%. At December 31, 2011, the largest commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $2.9 million and was secured by four automatic car wash buildings and fixtures. This loan was performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2011.
   
  In underwriting commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans, we review the expected net operating income generated by the real estate to ensure that it is at least 110% of the amount of the monthly debt service; the age and condition of the collateral; the financial resources and income level of the borrower; and the borrower’s business experience. Personal guarantees are routinely obtained from all commercial real estate borrowers.
   
  Loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family residential properties generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve a greater degree of risk. Commercial and multi-family residential mortgage loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties or underlying businesses, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of commercial real estate loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.
   
  Construction and Land.
 At December 31, 2011, construction and land loans totaled $5.1 million, or 1.8% of the total loan portfolio. We generally do not originate speculative construction loans, and we had no such loans in our portfolio at December 31, 2011. Our construction and land loans consisted of $347,000 of fixed-rate one-to-four family residential construction loans as well as $4.8 million of commercial new construction loans. One-to-four family residential construction loans are offered as interest-only loans at a fixed rate of interest for up to a five month construction period. Immediately following the construction period the loan begins monthly amortizing payments consistent with the terms of the one-to-four family permanent mortgage loan product. Commercial construction loans can consist of land development loans or new building construction loans as well as participation loans that include new building construction loans. Land development loans are collateralized by a mortgage on the property which is supported by an appraisal. Commercial construction loans are given for the construction phase of a building. There can be an interest only period for new construction loans not to exceed one year. Once the construction is completed, the loan is transferred into permanent financing. Draws for both residential and commercial new construction are based on the loan approval, commitment letter, and a building and loan agreement. Property inspections during the construction phase are also required.

  Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. In the event we make a land acquisition loan on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is the risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also expose us to the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
   
  Consumer Lending
. At December 31, 2011, consumer loans totaled $34.3 million, or 11.9% of the total loan portfolio. Our consumer loans consist of automobile loans, recreational vehicle loans, secured personal loans (secured by bonds, equity securities or other readily marketable collateral), and other consumer loans (consisting of passbook loans and unsecured home improvement loans). Consumer loans are originated with terms to maturity of three to seven years. Historically, we have sought to increase the level of consumer loans primarily through increased automobile lending. We participate in a number of indirect automobile lending programs with local automobile dealerships. All indirect automobile loans must satisfy our underwriting criteria for automobile loans originated directly by us to the borrower and must be approved by one of our lending officers. At December 31, 2011, loans secured by automobiles totaled $30.8 million, of which $21.4 million were originated through our indirect automobile lending program. We have also sought to increase the level of automobile loans directly to borrowers by increasing marketing efforts with existing customers. Automobile loans generally do not have terms exceeding six years. We do not provide financing for leased automobiles.
   
  Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one-to-four family mortgage loans. In addition, consumer loans expand the products and services we offer to better meet the financial services needs of our customers. Consumer loans generally involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the difference in the underlying collateral. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage to, loss of, or depreciation in the underlying collateral. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s personal financial stability. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
   
  Our underwriting procedures for consumer loans include an assessment of the applicant’s credit history and the ability to meet existing and proposed debt obligations. Although the applicant’s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security to the proposed loan amount. We underwrite consumer loans internally, which we believe limits its exposure to credit risks associated with loans underwritten or purchased from brokers and other external sources.

  Commercial Business Loans.
 At December 31, 2011, we had $37.7 million of commercial business loans which represented 13.1% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial business loans are originated with terms of up to seven years, at fixed rates of interest except for lines of credit which have variable rates of interest. Commercial business loans are generally originated to persons with a prior relationship with Oneida Savings Bank or referrals from persons with a prior relationship with Oneida Savings Bank. The decision to grant a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness and cash flow of the borrower (and any guarantors) and secondarily on the value of and ability to liquidate the collateral which generally consists of receivables, inventory and equipment. We generally require annual financial statements and tax returns from our commercial business borrowers and personal guarantees from the commercial business borrowers. We also generally require an appraisal of any real estate that secures the commercial business loan. At December 31, 2011, the largest commercial business loan totaled $2.5 million, which was secured by business assets, life insurance and liquid collateral of a for-profit telecom provider. At December 31, 2011, unsecured commercial business loans totaled $570,000.
   
  Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based, with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment.

       Loan Approval Procedures and Authority.
 The Board of Directors establishes our lending policies and loan approval limits. Loan officers generally have the authority to originate mortgage loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans up to amounts established for each lending officer. All residential loans over $500,000 must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee (consisting of three persons; the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Business Banking Officer, Designated Business Banking Officer or Mortgage Operations Department Head). All loan relationships in excess of $500,000 and up to $2.0 million (exclusive of residential mortgages and home equity loans secured by a lien on the borrower’s primary residence) must be approved by the Officer Loan Committee. All lending relationships in excess of $2.0 million up to $4.0 million (exclusive of residential mortgages and home equity loans secured by a lien on the borrower’s primary residence) must be approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. All lending relationships in excess of $4.0 million must be approved by the Board of Directors.
   
  All independent appraisers are approved by the Board of Directors annually. We require an environmental site assessment for all non-residential mortgage loans. Our policy is to require hazard insurance on all mortgage loans and generally to require title insurance on all residential mortgage loans.
   
  Loan Origination Fees and Other Income
.
 In addition to interest earned on loans, we receive loan origination fees. Such fees and costs vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased, principal repayments and competitive conditions in the mortgage markets, which in turn respond to the demand and availability of money.
   
  In addition to loan origination fees, we also receive other fees, servicing income and other income that consist primarily of mortgage servicing fees and late charges.
   
  Loans-to-One Borrower
. Savings banks are subject to the same loans-to-one borrower limits as those applicable to national banks, which under current regulations restrict loans to one borrower to an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired net worth on an unsecured basis, and an additional 10% of unimpaired net worth in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral having a market value, as determined by reliable and continuously available price quotations at least equal to the amount of the loan. Our policy provides that loans to one borrower (or related borrowers) should not exceed 15% of our capital.
   
  At December 31, 2011, the largest amount loaned to one borrower consisted of commercial real estate and commercial loans secured by commercial office space to a corporation with an outstanding balance totaling $4.8 million. This amount consisted of four commercial real estate loans secured by the property and other business assets and one commercial term loan secured by leasehold mortgage and business assets. At December 31, 2011 this lending relationship was performing in accordance with its terms.
   
  Asset Quality, Delinquencies and Classified Assets
   
  Collection Procedures.
 A computer generated late notice is sent when a loan’s grace period ends. After the late notice has been mailed, accounts are assigned to collectors for follow-up to determine reasons for delinquency and explore payment options. Generally, loans that are 30 days delinquent will receive a default notice. With respect to consumer loans, we will commence efforts to repossess the collateral after the loan becomes 45 days delinquent. Loans secured by real estate that are delinquent over 60 days are turned over to our Managed Asset Manager. Generally, after 90 days we will commence legal action.

     Table of Contents
      
  Loans Past Due and Nonperforming Assets
.
 Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on non-accrual status when they are 90 days past due or earlier when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a non-accrual status is reversed from interest income.
   
  Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as Other Real Estate (“ORE”) until such time as it is sold. When real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, it is recorded at its fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. If the value of the property is less than the loan balance, less any related specific loan loss provisions, the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses. Any subsequent write-down of ORE is charged against earnings.
   
  The following table sets forth certain delinquencies in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. When a loan is delinquent 90 days or more or earlier when, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful, we fully reverse all interest accrued and ceases to accrue interest thereafter.

  Of our total nonperforming loans at December 31, 2011 of $1.4 million, $382,000 consisted of three one-to-four family loans. We believe that the three one-to-four family loans are adequately collateralized and we do not anticipate any losses on such loans. These loans are in various stages of foreclosure. In addition, $150,000 of the nonperforming loans consisted of one home equity loan which is in the process of foreclosure. We do not anticipate a material loss on this loan. In addition, $836,000 of the nonperforming loans consisted of two commercial real estate loans. Both of the commercial real estate loans were considered impaired at December 31, 2011 and have a valuation allowance totaling $661,000 established. The property and assets underlying these loans are in the process of being sold. Also included in nonperforming loans was $69,000 representing two commercial loans, each of which is partially guaranteed by SBA. We do not anticipate a material loss on either of these loans. In addition, $3.6 million of trust preferred securities were in nonaccrual status at December 31, 2011. Management considered several factors in deciding that these securities should be placed on nonaccrual status, including whether interest is being paid in cash or is being added (capitalized) to the principal balance, a process known as a payment in kind, collateral values and excess subordination ratios which represents the point at which a tranche may experience a break in yield. Interest payments of $300,000 were received on these securities for the year ended December 31, 2011 which were recognized as a principal reduction. For additional information regarding these securities, see “-Securities Investment Activities” herein.
   
  During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, gross interest income of $124,000 and $171,000 would have been recorded on nonaccruing loans under their original terms, if the loans had been current throughout the period. No interest income was recorded on nonaccruing loans during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

  At December 31, 2011, our classified assets included loans identified by bank regulatory definitions of “substandard” and “doubtful”. We had no assets classified as “loss” at December 31, 2011. Substandard assets consisted of (i) three commercial relationships with a principal balance of $729,000, (ii) three one-to-four family residential loans with a principal balance of $382,000 and (iii) one home equity loan with a principal balance of $150,000. Doubtful assets consisted of (i) two commercial relationships with a principal balance of $128,000. In addition to the classified assets, we have identified certain impaired assets at December 31, 2011 consisting of (i) two commercial real estate loans with a principal balance of $836,000 and (ii) nine trust preferred securities with a carrying value of $3.6 million and (iii) two private placement collateralized mortgage obligations with a carrying value of $1.4 million. Included as a component of criticized assets are loans identified as “special mention” as determined by

  management according to regulatory guidance. At December 31, 2011, we had two commercial relationships identified as special mention with a principal balance of $1.2 million.
   
  In determining to classify $3.6 million of trust preferred securities as impaired at December 31, 2011, management compared the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimates to determine if there had been an adverse change in cash flows. The cash flow model considers the structure and term of the individual trust preferred securities, timing of interest and principal payments as well as allocation of the payments to the note classes. The current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information, including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of underlying trust preferred securities. In addition, assumptions relative to prepayments, deferrals and defaults, excess subordination, discount rates, and other factors are considered as part of the cash flow analysis. For additional information regarding assumptions used in evaluating the trust preferred securities for impairment, see note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trust preferred securities of $3.6 million were deemed impaired and were on nonaccrual status throughout 2011.
   
  Allowance for Loan Losses
.
 The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on the historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent three years. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. Management makes appropriate provisions for loan losses on a quarterly basis. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and valuation of real estate owned. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. At December 31, 2011, the total allowance was $2.9 million, which amounted to 1.02% of loans, net and 201.81% of nonperforming loans. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had net charge-offs of $2.4 million and $275,000, respectively, against this allowance. The increase in charge-offs during 2011 was primarily attributable to the charge-off of a fully reserved, impaired, unsecured commercial loan with a principal balance of $2.0 million in April 2011.

       Securities Investment Activities
   
  The securities investment policy is established by our Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, our liquidity needs, potential returns, cash flow targets and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, management considers the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors of quality, maturity, marketability, liquidity and risk diversification.
   
  Our current policies generally limit security investments to U.S. Government and agency securities, tax-exempt bonds, public utilities debt obligations, corporate debt obligations and corporate equity securities. In addition, our policy permits investments in mortgage related securities, including securities issued by government sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Our investment strategy is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk. We will only purchase securities rated as investment grade by a nationally recognized investment rating agency. We do not engage in any hedging transactions, such as interest rate swaps or caps.
   
  We evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. The assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time.
   
  At December 31, 2011, we had nine trust preferred securities with an aggregate fair value of $3.6 million and aggregate unrealized losses of $2.7 million. Of the $3.6 million, $1.0 million have variable rates of interest. All of these securities are rated below investment grade as of December 31, 2011. All of these securities are on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2011. The issuers of these securities are primarily banks, but some of the pools do include a limited number of insurance companies. As of December 31, 2011, through review of the current and expected cash flow analysis based on the credit quality of the underlying collateral, the class of securities we own, default probabilities and anticipated losses given default assumptions and stress tests performed on these securities, all of the trust preferred securities have been considered impaired as of December 31, 2011. The other-than-temporary impairment loss taken for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $292,000.
   
  Unrealized losses on other investments have not been recognized into income because the issuer(s) securities are of investment grade (except for Strats-Goldman Sachs Corporation as indicated below), management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity.
   
  At December 31, 2011, we had a $2.5 million Strats-Goldman Sachs Corporation obligation, maturing February 15, 2034 which is rated below investment grade. This is a variable rate note based on the six month LIBOR. The current rate on the security is 1.77%. The unrealized loss on this security was

     Table of Contents
       
   
  $1.2 million and $914,000 as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively. Strats-Goldman Sachs is paying as agreed. This loss has not been considered other-than-temporary in that we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the cost basis, which may be at maturity.
   
  Investment Securities.
 At December 31, 2011, we had $151.7 million, or 22.9% of total assets, invested in investment securities, which consisted primarily of U.S. Government obligations, tax-exempt securities and corporate debt obligations. Investment securities decreased $10.0 million or 6.2% at December 31, 2011 as compared to December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment securities was due to an increase in loans receivable, an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in borrowings. There were trust preferred investments with an aggregate fair value of $3.6 million and an amortized cost of $6.3 million included in corporate debt obligations at December 31, 2011. We are required to designate securities as held to maturity, available for sale or trading, depending on our ability and intent regarding our investments. During 2011, we have designated certain investment securities as held to maturity in addition to available for sale. Investment securities in which the fair value option has been elected are considered trading assets and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. Trading securities, which consisted of common and preferred equity securities, totaled $7.0 million or 1.1% of total assets at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, our investment securities portfolio had a weighted average life of 5.97 years.

  Mortgage-Backed Securities
.
 We purchase mortgage-backed securities in order to: (i) generate positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense; (ii) lower our credit risk; and (iii) increase liquidity. At December 31, 2011, we had $92.8 million or 14.0% of total assets invested in mortgage-backed securities; of which $24.9 million were classified as held to maturity. Prior to January 1, 2009, all mortgage-backed securities were classified as available for sale. The mortgage-backed securities portfolio had coupon rates ranging from 0.68% to 7.81%, a weighted average yield of 2.89% and a weighted average life (including payment assumption) of 5.13 years at December 31, 2011.
   
  Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we focus our investments on mortgage-related securities backed by single-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally U.S. Government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors, such as Oneida Savings Bank, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to these investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. In addition, mortgage-related securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize certain of our liabilities and obligations. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual prepayments will be greater than estimated over the life of the security, which
  
       22
     Table of Contents
       
  may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments thereby reducing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or in the event such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Management reviews prepayment estimates periodically to ensure that prepayment assumptions are reasonable considering the underlying collateral for the securities at issue and current interest rates and to determine the yield and estimated maturity of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Of our $92.8 million mortgage-backed securities portfolio at December 31, 2011, $5,762 with a weighted average yield of 4.90% had contractual maturities within five years, $12.8 million with a weighted average yield of 2.31% had contractual maturities of five to ten years and $80.0 million with a weighted average yield of 2.97% had contractual maturities of over ten years. However, the actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security may be less than its stated maturity due to prepayments of the underlying mortgages or significant defaults of the underlying mortgages. Prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and may result in a loss of any premiums paid and thereby reduce the net yield on such securities. Although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors, the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments. Historically, during periods of declining mortgage interest rates, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security. Under such circumstances, we may be subject to reinvestment risk because, to the extent that our mortgage related securities prepay faster than anticipated, we may not be able to reinvest the proceeds of such repayments and prepayments at a comparable rate of return. During 2011, mortgage interest rates remained at historical low levels throughout the year. 
The impact on our mortgage-backed securities portfolio is to increase the prepayments at a faster rate than anticipated. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment prepayments may decline, thereby extending the estimated life of the security and depriving us of the ability to reinvest cash flows at the increased rates of interest. 
   
  Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (“CMOs”) are debt securities issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and creates different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into “tranches” or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows, while cash flows on pass-through mortgage-backed securities are distributed pro rata to all security holders.
   
  At December 31, 2011, we had two private placement collateralized mortgage obligations totaling $1.4 million which are both rated below investment grade. Both were rated investment grade at the time of purchase. The unrealized loss at December 31, 2011 was $89,070. As of December 31, 2011, through review of the current and expected cash flow analysis based on the credit quality of the underlying collateral, default probabilities and anticipated losses, these securities have been considered impaired. The other-than-temporary impairment loss taken for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $75,000. These securities remain available for sale as of December 31, 2011.

       Sources of Funds
   
  General.
 Our primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes are deposits, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from sales of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and cash flows from operations.
   
  Deposits.
 We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings, interest-bearing demand accounts, non interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We also offer IRAs and other qualified plan accounts. Through our limited purpose subsidiary, State Bank of Chittenango, we held $118.9 million in municipal deposits at December 31, 2011.
   
  At December 31, 2011, deposits totaled $550.6 million and decreased $1.5 million, or 0.3%, from $552.2 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in deposits was offset by an increase in municipal deposits over the past twelve months. At December 31, 2011, we had a total of $140.3 million in certificates of deposit, of which $99.6 million had maturities of one year or less. Although we have a significant portion of deposits in shorter term certificates of deposit, management monitors activity on these accounts. Based on historical experience and our current pricing strategy, management believes it will retain a large portion of such accounts upon maturity. At December 31, 2011 certificates of deposit with balances of $100,000 or more totaled $50.7 million.
   
  The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which our branch offices are located. We rely primarily on competitive pricing of deposit products and customer service and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits. We use traditional means of advertising our deposit products, including radio and print media and generally do not solicit deposits from outside our market area. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000, and may be subject to preferential rates, we do not actively solicit such deposits as they are more difficult to retain than core deposits. During 2009, the FDIC temporarily increased federal deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor from $100,000. In 2009, Congress enacted legislation to extend the increase to $250,000 in insurable deposits per depositor until 2013. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per account, and non-interest bearing transactions accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. Historically, we have not used brokers to obtain deposits. We participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARs”) that enables the institution to provide customers to access to up to $50 million in FDIC insurance on CD investments.

  Trust Activities
   
  Oneida Savings Bank provides trust and investment services, acts as executor or administrator of estates and as trustee or custodian for various types of trusts. Trust services are offered through Oneida Savings Bank’s Trust Department. Services include fiduciary services for trusts and estates, money management and custodial services. At December 31, 2011, Oneida Savings Bank maintained 518 trust/fiduciary accounts, with total assets of $110.8 million under management as compared to 539 trust/fiduciary accounts, with total assets of $114.2 million at December 31, 2010. Management anticipates that in the future the Trust Department will become a more significant component of Oneida Savings Bank’s business.
   
  Personnel
   
  As of December 31, 2011, we had 321 full-time employees and 22 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. Management believes that we have a good relationship with its employees.
   
  Regulation 
   
  General.
 Oneida Savings Bank is a New York-chartered savings bank and our deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Deposit Insurance Fund. Oneida Savings Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the New York State Banking Department (the “Department”) as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as the insurer of its deposit accounts. Oneida Savings Bank must file reports with the Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concerning its activities and financial

  condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including acquisitions of other financial institutions. Oneida Savings Bank is examined periodically by the Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to test Oneida Savings Bank’s compliance with various laws and regulations. This regulation and supervision, as well as federal and state law, establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Oneida Savings Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
   
  Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the Department or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could have a material adverse impact on Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank and their operations.	
   
  Set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are applicable to Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank.
   
  New Federal Legislation
   
  In 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) which is significantly changing the bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. As of July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies, like Oneida Financial Corp., in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates. The Office of Thrift Supervision, which was Oneida Financial Inc.’s prior regulator, was eliminated. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $500 million are exempt from these capital requirements. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the proceeds of trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directed the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
  The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Oneida Savings Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gave state attorney general’s the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.

     Table of Contents
       
  The legislation broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided for regulations requiring that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on paying interest on commercial checking accounts and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
  The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
  New York Bank Regulation.
 Oneida Savings Bank derives its lending, investment, branching and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the Department, as limited by federal laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including Oneida Savings Bank, may invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies, certain types of corporate equity securities and certain other assets. Under the statutory authority for investing in equity securities, a savings bank may invest up to 7.5% of its assets in corporate stock, with an overall limit of 5% of its assets invested in common stock. Investment in the stock of a single corporation is limited to the lesser of 2% of the outstanding stock of such corporation or 1% of the savings bank’s assets, except as set forth below. Such equity securities must meet certain earnings ratios and other tests of financial performance. A savings bank’s lending powers are not subject to percentage of assets limitations, although there are limits applicable to single borrowers. A savings bank may also, pursuant to the “leeway” power, make investments not otherwise permitted under the New York State Banking Law. This power permits investments in otherwise impermissible investments of up to 1% of assets in any single investment, subject to certain restrictions and to an aggregate limit for all such investments of up to 5% of assets. Additionally, in lieu of investing in such securities in accordance with and reliance upon the specific investment authority set forth in the New York State Banking Law, savings banks are authorized to elect to invest under a “prudent person” standard in a wider range of investment securities as compared to the types of investments permissible under such specific investment authority. However, in the event a savings bank elects to utilize the “prudent person” standard, it will be unable to avail itself of the other provisions of the New York State Banking Law and regulations which set forth specific investment authority. Oneida Savings Bank has not elected to conduct its investment activities under the “prudent person” standard. 
A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Department.
   
  New York State chartered savings banks may also invest in subsidiaries under their service corporation investment authority. A savings bank may use this power to invest in corporations that engage in various activities authorized for savings banks, plus any additional activities that may be authorized by the Banking Board. Investment by a savings bank in the stock, capital notes and debentures of its service corporations is limited to 3% of the bank’s assets, and such investments, together with the bank’s loans to its service corporations, may not exceed 10% of the savings bank’s assets. Furthermore, New York banking regulations impose requirements on loans which a bank may make to its executive officers and directors and to certain corporations or partnerships in which such persons have equity
  
       29
     Table of Contents
       
  interests. These requirements include that (i) certain loans must be approved in advance by a majority of the entire board of directors and the interested party must abstain from participating directly or indirectly in voting on such loan, (ii) the loan must be on terms that are not more favorable than those offered to unaffiliated third parties, and (iii) the loan must not involve more than a normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
   
  Under the New York State Banking Law, the Superintendent may issue an order to a New York State chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the Department that any director, trustee or officer of any banking organization has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee or officer may be removed from office after notice and an opportunity to be heard. Oneida Savings Bank does not know of any past or current practice, condition or violation that may lead to any proceeding by the Superintendent or the Department against Oneida Savings Bank or any of its directors, trustees or officers.
   
  Insurance of Deposit Accounts.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institution and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. Non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. An institution is assigned an assessment rate based upon the supervisory risk category to which it is assigned and certain possible risk-based adjustments, with institutions perceived as less risky, paying lower rates.
  The FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund annually at between 1.15% and 1.5% of estimated insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the statutory minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increase from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by September 30, 2020. Banks with assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from any additional assessments necessary to increase the reserve fund above 1.15%. In 2009, as part of a plan to restore the reserve ratio, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions equal to five basis points of assets less Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009, payable on September 30, 2009. Oneida Savings Bank recorded an expense of $268,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, to reflect the special assessment. In addition, the FDIC increased its quarterly deposit insurance assessment rates and amended the method by which rates are calculated.
  In addition, in lieu of further special assessments, the FDIC required all insured depository institutions to prepay on December 30, 2009 their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. Estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010 were based upon the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009, with 3 basis points added for the 2011 and 2012 assessment rates. In addition, a 5% annual growth in the assessment base was assumed. Prepaid assessments are to be applied against the actual quarterly assessments until exhausted, and may not be applied to any special assessments that may occur in the future. Any unused prepayments will be returned to the institution on June 30, 2013. On December 30, 2009, Oneida Savings Bank prepaid approximately $2.4 million in estimated assessment fees. Because the prepaid assessments represent the prepayment of future expense, they do not affect Oneida Savings Bank’s capital (the prepaid asset will have a risk-weighting of 0%) or tax obligations.
  The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its risk-based assessment procedures to base it on average total assets less tangible capital, rather than deposits. In response, the FDIC issued a final rule
   
  
       30
     Table of Contents
       
  that took effect April 1, 2011. The assessment scale now ranges from 2½ basis points of total assets less tangible capital (generally defined as Tier 1 capital) to 45 basis points.
   
  Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
   
  In addition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to .68 basis points of total assets less tangible capital.
   
  Regulatory Capital Requirements.
 The FDIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines which are applicable to Oneida Savings Bank. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Oneida Savings Bank is required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of such regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as Oneida Savings Bank’s “risk-based capital ratio.” Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items to four risk-weighted categories ranging from 0% to 100%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk.
   
  These guidelines divide a savings bank’s capital into two tiers. The first tier (“Tier I”) includes common equity, retained earnings, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues) and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships subject to certain limitations). Supplementary (“Tier II”) capital includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less required deductions. Savings banks are required to maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, of which at least 4% must be Tier I capital.
   
  In addition, the FDIC has established regulations prescribing a minimum Tier I leverage ratio (Tier I capital to adjusted total assets as specified in the regulations). These regulations provide for a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including that they have the highest examination rating and are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth. All other banks are required to maintain a Tier I leverage ratio of at least 4%. The FDIC may, however, set higher leverage and risk-based capital requirements on individual institutions when particular circumstances warrant. Savings banks experiencing or anticipating significant growth are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels.
   
  Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions.
 The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a savings bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. New York law also restricts Oneida Savings Bank from declaring a dividend which would reduce its capital below (i) the amount required to be maintained under state law and regulation or (ii) the
   
  
       31
     Table of Contents
       
  amount of Oneida Savings Bank’s liquidation account established in connection with its reorganization from mutual form.
   
  Prompt Corrective Action.
 The federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action required by federal law. Under the regulations, a bank shall be deemed to be (i) “well capitalized” if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, has a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, has a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 4.0% or more and a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more (3.0% under certain circumstances) and does not meet the definition of “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% (3.0% under certain circumstances); (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0% or a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Federal law and regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).
   
  Based on the foregoing, Oneida Savings Bank is currently classified as a well capitalized savings institution.
   
  Activities as Principal and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks.
 Federal law generally limits the activities as principal and equity investments of FDIC-insured state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks, notwithstanding state laws. Under federal regulations dealing with equity investments, an insured state bank generally may not, directly or indirectly, acquire or retain any equity investment of a type, or in an amount, that is not permissible for a national bank. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, the activities of which are limited to those permissible for a subsidiary of a national bank; (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is the direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank’s total assets; (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors’, trustees’, and officers’ liability insurance coverage or bankers’ blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions; and (iv) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met.
   
  Federal law and FDIC regulations permit certain exceptions to the foregoing limitation. For example, certain state-chartered banks, such as Oneida Savings Bank, may continue to invest in common or preferred stock listed on a National Securities Exchange, and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank had $3.0 million of securities pursuant to this exception. As a savings bank, Oneida Savings Bank may also continue to sell savings bank life insurance. The FDIC may also permit otherwise prohibited activities for banks and their subsidiaries if applicable capital requirements are met and the activity is not deemed significantly risky to the insurance fund.
   
  Transactions With Affiliates.
 Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. An affiliate of a savings bank is any company or entity that controls, is
   
  
       32
     Table of Contents
       
  controlled by, or is under common control with the savings bank, other than a subsidiary of the savings bank. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a savings bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the savings bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the savings bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such savings bank’s capital stock and surplus and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans or other extensions of credit to an affiliate; the purchase of assets from an affiliate, the purchase of, or an investment in, the securities of an affiliate; the acceptance of securities of an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person; or issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions, and a broad list of other specified transactions, be on terms substantially the same, or no less favorable, to the savings bank or its subsidiary as similar transactions with nonaffiliates.
   
  Further, the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation restricts a savings bank with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, principal stockholders, and their related interests. Under these regulations, loans to directors, executive officers and stockholders who control, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of voting securities of a savings bank and certain related interests of any of the foregoing, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the savings bank’s total capital and surplus. In addition, federal law also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors, executive officers, and stockholders who control 10% or more of voting securities of a stock savings bank, and their respective related interests, unless such loan is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors on the board of directors of the savings bank. Any “interested” director may not participate in the voting. The loan amount (which includes all other outstanding loans to such person) as to which such prior board of director approval is required, is the greater of $25,000 or 5% of capital and surplus or any loans over $500,000. Further, loans to directors, executive officers and principal stockholders must generally be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons. Additional limitations are also imposed on loans to executive officers.
   
  Federal Community Reinvestment Regulation. 
Under the Community Reinvestment Act, as amended (the “CRA”), and its implementing regulations, a savings bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a savings institution, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Oneida Savings Bank’s latest CRA rating was “satisfactory.”
   
  New York State Community Reinvestment Regulation.
 
Oneida Savings Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law which imposes continuing and affirmative obligations upon banking institutions organized in New York State to serve the credit needs of its local community (“NYCRA”) which are substantially similar to those imposed by the CRA. Pursuant to the NYCRA, a bank must file an annual NYCRA report and copies of all federal CRA reports with the Department. The NYCRA requires the Department to make a biennial written assessment of a bank’s compliance with the NYCRA, utilizing a four-tiered rating system and make such assessment available to the public. The
   
  
       33
     Table of Contents
       
  NYCRA also requires the Superintendent to consider a bank’s NYCRA rating when reviewing a bank’s application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices or automated teller machines, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. Oneida Savings Bank’s NYCRA rating as of its latest examination was “outstanding.”
   
  Federal Home Loan Bank System.
 Oneida Savings Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs, that administers the home financing credit function of savings institutions. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members ( i.e.
, advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing.
   
  As a member, Oneida Savings Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of New York. As of December 31, 2011, Oneida Savings Bank had $2.1 million of FHLB stock. The dividend yield from FHLB stock was 5.00% at December 31, 2011. No assurance can be given that the FHLB will pay any dividends in the future.
   
  Under federal law, the FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings institutions and to contribute to low and moderately priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of Oneida Savings Bank’s FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank’s capital.

Federal law allows a state savings bank that qualifies as a “Qualified Thrift Lender,” as discussed below, to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provision of the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933, as amended. Such election results in its holding company being regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve Board rather than as a bank holding company. Oneida Savings Bank has made such an election. Accordingly, Oneida Financial Corp. is registered as a savings and loan holding company and is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Oneida Financial Corp. and any non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. The powers and duties of the Office of Thrift Supervision relating to savings and loan holding companies, including rulemaking and supervision authority, were transferred to the Federal Reserve Board on July 21, 2011.
   
  Permissible Activities.
 Under present law, the business activities of Oneida Financial Corp. are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited

  to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) (8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, and certain additional activities authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulations.
   
  Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings association or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
   
  The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies, and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
   
  Qualified Thrift Lender Test
.
 To be regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Federal Reserve Bank rather than as a bank holding company, Oneida Savings Bank must qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender. To qualify as a Qualified Thrift Lender, Oneida Savings Bank must be a “domestic building and loan association,” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, or comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender test under Federal Reserve Board regulations. Under the Qualified Thrift Lender test, a savings institution is required to maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (2) intangibles, including goodwill; and (3) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities) in at least nine months out of each 12-month period. As of December 31, 2011 Oneida Savings Bank met the Qualified Thrift Lender test.
  Capital.
 Savings and loan holding companies are not currently subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital as is currently the case with bank holding companies. Instruments issued by May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. There is a five-year transition period (from the July 21, 2010 effective date of the Dodd-Frank Act) before the capital requirements will apply to savings and loan holding companies.
   
  Source of Strength and Dividends. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must issue regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies that it has suggested is applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the
  
       35
     Table of Contents
       
  prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may also be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Oneida Financial Corp. to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
   
  Change in Control Regulations
   
  Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Oneida Financial Corp. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, is the case with Oneida Financial Corp., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   
  New York State Bank Holding Company Regulation
   
  General.
 In addition to the federal regulation, a holding company controlling a state chartered savings bank organized or doing business in New York State also may be subject to regulation under the New York State Banking Law. The term “bank holding company,” for the purposes of the New York State Banking Law, is defined generally to include any person, company or trust that directly or indirectly either controls the election of a majority of the directors or owns, controls or holds with power to vote more than 10% of the voting stock of a bank holding company or, if the company is a banking institution, another banking institution, or 10% or more of the voting stock of each of two or more banking institutions. In general, a bank holding company controlling, directly or indirectly, only one banking institution will not be deemed to be a bank holding company for the purposes of the New York State Banking Law. Under New York State Banking Law, the prior approval of the Banking Board is required before: (1) any action is taken that causes any company to become a bank holding company; (2) any action is taken that causes any banking institution to become or be merged or consolidated with a subsidiary of a bank holding company; (3) any bank holding company acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock of a banking institution; (4) any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof acquires all or substantially all of the assets of a banking institution; or (5) any action is taken that causes any bank holding company to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. Additionally, certain restrictions apply to New York State bank holding companies regarding the acquisition of banking institutions, which have been chartered five years or less and are located in smaller communities. Officers, directors and employees of New York State bank holding companies are subject to limitations regarding their affiliation with securities underwriting or brokerage firms and other bank holding companies and limitations regarding loans obtained from its subsidiaries.

  The USA PATRIOT Act
   
  General.
 The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act amended the Bank Secrecy Act to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Moreover, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, savings associations, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
   
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
   
  General.

As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will be required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
   
  Federal Reserve System
   
  General.

    Federal Taxation
   
  General.
 Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Oneida Financial Corp. or Oneida Savings Bank.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank’s most recent IRS audit was relative to Oneida Savings bank’s 2008 and 2009 federal and state income tax returns.
   
  Method of Accounting
.
 For federal income tax purposes, Oneida Financial Corp. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
   
  Alternate Minimum Tax.
 The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) imposes an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (“alternative minimum taxable income” or “AMTI”). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank are subject to the AMT however, neither corporation has any minimum tax credit carry forwards at December 31, 2011.
   
  Net Operating Loss Carryovers.
 Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. However, as a result of recent legislation, subject to certain limitations, the carry back period for net operating losses incurred in 2009 and 2010 (but not both years) has been expanded to five years. At December 31, 2011, Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank had no net operating loss carry forward for federal income tax purposes.
  Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction
.
 Oneida Financial Corp. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Oneida Savings Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
   
  State Taxation
   
  General. 
Oneida Financial Corp. and Oneida Savings Bank report income on a combined calendar year basis to New York State. New York State Franchise Tax on corporations is imposed in an amount equal to the greater of (a) 7.1% of “entire net income” allocable to New York State (b) 3% of “alternative entire net income” allocable to New York State (c) 0.01% of the average value of assets allocable to New York State or (d) nominal minimum tax. Entire net income is based on federal taxable income, subject to certain modifications. Alternative entire net income is equal to entire net income without certain modifications.
   
  Audit of Tax Returns.
 New York State Department of Taxation’s most recent audit was of the Company’s 2008 state income tax return.

ITEM 1A.	RISK FACTORS
   
  Concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase risk.
   
  Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in upstate New York, as nearly all of our loans are to customers in this market. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in upstate New York have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans. As such, a decline in real estate valuations in this market would lower the value of the collateral securing those loans. In addition, a significant weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results.
   
  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 
   
  Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, an increase in interest rates generally would tend to result in a decrease in our net interest income. We have taken steps to mitigate this risk such as holding fewer longer-term residential mortgages as well as investing excess funds in shorter-term investments.
   
  Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our investment securities available for sale. Generally, the value of our investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, our investment securities available for sale totaled $197.3 million. Unrealized gains on our securities available for sale totaled $189,000 and are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of our stockholders’ equity. Decreases in the fair value of our securities available for sale, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity or our earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.
   
   
       39
     Table of Contents
      
   
  Changes in interest rates may also affect the average life of our loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on our existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.
   
  A majority of our real estate loans held for investment are adjustable-rate loans. Any rise in market interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgage loans, increasing the possibility of default. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans help make our loan portfolio more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. At December 31, 2011, approximately 60.8% of our total loans had adjustable rates of interest.
   
  We could record future losses on our securities portfolio. 
  During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $367,000 of impairment losses on securities, of which $367,000 was recognized in our income statement. At December 31, 2011, we held trust preferred securities, corporate debt securities and non-government agency collateralized mortgage obligations with unrealized losses of $2.7 million, $2.2 million and $89,000, respectively.
   
  A number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these securities constitutes an impairment that is other than temporary, which could result in material losses to us. These factors include, but are not limited to, continued failure by the issuer to make scheduled interest payments, an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and/or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value. In addition, the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers continue to deteriorate and there remains limited liquidity for these securities.
   
  We also hold investment securities for which the fair value option has been elected, which are considered trading securities. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings and may result in higher volatility in our earnings.
   
  If our non-performing assets increase, our earnings will suffer. 
   
  At December 31, 2011, our non-performing assets (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent, foreclosed real estate assets and non-accruing investment securities) totaled $5.2 million, which is a decrease of $2.3 million over non-performing assets at December 31, 2010. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans or investments or on real estate owned. We must reserve for probable losses, which are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses, and from time to time, write down the value of properties in our other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to our other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Oneida Savings Bank. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly.
  
       40
     Table of Contents
       
  Increases to the allowance for loan losses would cause our earnings to decrease. 
   
  Our customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to repay the remaining principal balance of the loan. Hence, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require us to make additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
   
  Our emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in determining the amount of our allowance for loan losses. As we continue to emphasize the origination of these loans, additional provisions for loan losses may be necessary which would decrease our earnings.
   
  Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.
   
  Commercial real estate and business loans increase our exposure to credit risks. 
   
  At December 31, 2011, our portfolio of commercial real estate and multi-family loans totaled $77.5 million, or 26.8% of total loans, and our commercial business loans totaled $37.7 million, or 13.1% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than one-to-four family residential real estate lending because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful business operations and income stream of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. Finally, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate or commercial business loan, our holding period for the collateral, if any, typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.
   
  We target our business lending and marketing strategy towards small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
   
  Our loan portfolio has greater risk due to the substantial number of home equity loans and consumer loans.
   
  At December 31, 2011, our home equity loans totaled $45.0 million, or 15.6% of our total loan portfolio. Our home equity loans are primarily secured by second mortgages, and the combined loan-to-value ratio (first and second mortgage liens) for home equity loans may have been as high as 90% at the time of origination and may be higher at present. At December 31, 2011, our consumer loans totaled
  
       41
     Table of Contents
       
  $34.3 million, or 11.9% of our total loan portfolio, of which $30.8 million consisted of automobile loans. Our automobile loans include a substantial number of automobile loans that are referred to us by participating automobile dealerships located in our market area, although our lending staff underwrites and approves such loans. Our consumer loan portfolio also includes automobile loans originated directly by us, as well as unsecured loans and loans secured by other personal property. Home equity loans and consumer loans generally have greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are secured by second mortgages or by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles, or that are unsecured. In these cases, we face the risk that collateral, when we have it, for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. Particularly with respect to our home equity loans, any decrease in real estate values that adversely affect the value of the property serving as collateral for our loans would have a greater effect on the value of collateral securing a second mortgage. Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans.
   
  As a result of our large portfolio of home equity loans and consumer loans, it may become necessary to increase our provision for loan losses, which could reduce our profits.
   
  Municipal deposits are price sensitive and could result in an increase in interest expense or funding fluctuations.
   
  In recent years 
we have had significant growth in our municipal deposits from sources within our market area. These deposits are price sensitive source of funds from both an interest and service charge perspective. We may experience a sudden increase in interest expense if market interest rates rise suddenly or risk the possibility of deposit outflow if we are unwilling to price these deposits as aggressively as our competition. This liquidity risk may require us to sell the investment securities collateralizing the municipal deposits at a loss or to access higher cost borrowings which would result in an increase in our interest expense.
   
  Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees. 
   
  Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, and to expand into new businesses and geographic regions depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate our employees. Competition for qualified employees is often intense. Moreover, future laws or regulations limiting the amount of compensation financial institutions may pay to senior management may adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees.
   
  We have continued to increase total revenue and net income from non-banking sources such as insurance commissions and employee benefit consulting and services. Key employees provide expertise in the management of these business lines and develop and maintain customer relationships. The loss of those key employees would adversely affect the growth of our non-banking businesses and their continued profitability.
   
  Conditions in insurance markets could adversely affect our earnings.
   
  As we have diversified our sources of income, we have become increasingly reliant on non-interest income, particularly insurance fees and commissions. Revenue from these sources could be negatively affected by fluctuating premiums in the insurance markets or other factors beyond our control. Other factors that affect our insurance revenue are the profitability and growth of our clients, continued development of new products and services, as well as our access to new markets. Our insurance revenues
   
  
       42
     Table of Contents
       
  and profitability may also be adversely affected by regulatory developments impacting the healthcare and insurance markets, possibly including recent legislative proposals relating to national health insurance.
   
  We hold certain intangible assets that in the future could be classified as either partially or fully impaired, which would reduce our earnings and the book values of these assets.
  We test our intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Our impairment testing incorporates the current market price of our common stock, the estimated fair value of our assets and liabilities, and certain information of similar companies. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in a decline in value of our intangible assets which would adversely affect our financial condition. If we determine an impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangibles would be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our shares of common stock or our regulatory capital levels. If we acquire additional financial institutions or financial services companies, it is likely that the amount of goodwill included in our intangible assets will increase.
   
  Strong competition may limit our growth and profitability. 
   
  Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market area.
   
  Higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums and special assessments will adversely affect our earnings.
  Recent bank failures coupled with the severe economic recession and continued weakness in the national economy have significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund’s reserve ratio. On April 1, 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation made effective a final rule, required by the Dodd-Frank Act that altered the way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation calculates federal deposit insurance assessment rates. Under the rule, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation first established an institution’s initial base assessment rate. This initial base assessment rate ranges from 5-35 basis points of total assets less Tier 1 capital, depending on the risk category of the institution. The FDIC previously based its assessments on the volume of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation then adjusts the initial base assessment (higher or lower) to obtain the total base assessment rate. The adjustments to the initial base assessment rate are based upon an institution’s levels of long-term unsecured debt, unsecured debt of other institutions held and brokered deposits. The total assessment schedule, with possible adjustments, ranges from 2.5 to 45 basis points.
  On May 22, 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution's assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. We recorded an expense of $268,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, to reflect the special assessment. Any further special assessments that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation levies will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period. 
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has adopted a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009, and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. This pre-payment was due on December 30, 2009. The assessment rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for 2010 was based on each institution’s total base assessment rate
  
       43
     Table of Contents
       
  for the third quarter of 2009, modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009 had been in effect for the entire third quarter, and the assessment rate for 2011 and 2012 was equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points. In addition, each institution’s base assessment rate for each period was calculated using its third quarter assessment base, adjusted quarterly for an estimated 5% annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of 2012. We are required to record the pre-payment as a prepaid expense, which will be amortized to expense over three years. Our prepayment amount was $2.4 million.
  Our Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance expense totaled $513,000, $769,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, in 2011, 2010 and 2009. Increases in assessment rates or additional special assessments, will negatively impact future earnings.
   
  The United States economy remains weak and unemployment levels are high. The prolonged economic downturn will adversely affect our business and financial results.
   
  The United States experienced a severe economic recession in 2008 and 2009. While economic growth has resumed recently, the rate of growth has been slow and unemployment remains at very high levels and is not expected to improve in the near future. Loan portfolio quality has deteriorated at many financial institutions reflecting, in part, the weak U.S. economy and high unemployment. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. The continuing real estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and in increased delinquencies in construction, residential and commercial mortgage loans. Bank and bank holding company stock prices have declined substantially, and it is significantly more difficult for banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets.
   
  Continued negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the market for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Moreover, continued declines in the stock market in general, or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically, could adversely affect our stock performance.
   
  Financial reform legislation recently enacted by Congress has, among other things, eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, tightened capital standards, created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and may result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations. 
   
  In 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act provided for the elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision and authorized the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies, like Oneida Financial Corp., in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries; the components of Tier 1 capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The legislation also established a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within 18 months that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.

  The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Oneida Savings Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
  The legislation broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a depository institution. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2009, and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided for regulations requiring that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk transferred, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the pricing of certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on paying interest on commercial checking accounts and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, and by authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company’s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
  It is difficult to predict at this time the effect that the legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have delayed effective dates and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years. Although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those relating to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, will increase our operating and compliance costs.
   
  Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income. 
   
  In response to the financial crisis of 2008 and early 2009, Congress took various actions that were intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in depository institutions, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took various actions, including increasing insurance coverage on deposit accounts. In addition, there have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution’s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral.
   
  The potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. Bank regulatory agencies, such as the New York State Banking Department, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board, govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors. In addition, new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.

  We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
   
  We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding companies may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution’s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change. Any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.
   
  If our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York becomes impaired, our earnings and stockholders’ equity could decrease.
   
  We are required to own common stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the Federal Home Loan Bank’s advance program. The aggregate carrying value of our Federal Home Loan Bank common stock as of December 31, 2011 was $2.1 million. Federal Home Loan Bank common stock is not a marketable security and can only be redeemed by the Federal Home Loan Bank.
   
  Federal Home Loan Banks may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their regulatory capital. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York common stock could be deemed impaired at some time in the future, and if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and stockholders’ equity to decrease by the amount of the impairment charge.
   
  System failure or breaches of our information systems could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.
   
  We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, including risk to data integrity. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and

ITEM 3.	 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
   
  Much of Oneida Savings Bank’s market area is included in the 250,000-acre land claim of the Oneida Indian Nation (“Oneidas”). The land claim area is held primarily by private persons. Over 16 years ago, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Oneidas in a lawsuit which management believes was intended to encourage the State of New York to negotiate an equitable settlement in a land dispute that has existed for 200 years.
   
  In June 1998, the United States Justice Department intervened in the action on behalf of the Oneidas against Madison County and Oneida County in New York State. In September 1998, a United States District Court removed a stay of litigation, having been in place since the late 1980’s pending settlement negotiations. In December 1998, both the Oneidas and the United States Justice Department filed motions to amend the long outstanding claim against the State of New York. The motions attempt to include in the claim, various named and 20,000 unnamed additional defendants, who own real property in parts of Madison and Oneida Counties, thereby including the additional defendants in the original suit. The U.S. District Court granted the motions to add as a defendant the State of New York, but denied the motions to add the private landowners. Neither Oneida Savings Bank nor Oneida Financial Corp. is a named defendant in the motion. The court further rejected as not being viable the remedies of ejectment and/or of monetary damages against private landowners. In January 2001, amended complaints were served by the Oneidas and the United States, which seek to eject the Counties of Madison and Oneida from lands owned by the counties, and the Oneidas also seek a declaration that they have the right to possess all land within the land claim area. In June 2001, the court determined that certain land purchased by the Oneidas in 1997 and 1998 are exempt from real estate taxes, accepting the Oneidas argument that the acquired parcels lie within the boundaries of the “reservation” established in 1794 by the Federal Government. The State of New York, Counties of Madison and Oneida and the City of Sherrill appealed the court’s decision with a court date in March 2002. In February 2002, a joint statement was issued by the Oneidas, State of New York and the Counties of Madison and Oneida, indicating that the framework for a settlement had been agreed upon, subject to the approval by the State legislature and the Federal Government. The Oneidas of Wisconsin and the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Indians have commenced separate actions in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York to dispute and interrupt any settlement pending.  
In July 2003, the United States Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court against the City of Sherrill but appeals continue relative to the decision against the Counties of Madison and Oneida. In January 2005 the United States Supreme Court heard the appeal brought forward by the City of Sherrill against the Oneidas arguing that the acquisition of real property by the Oneidas within the land claim area does not return the property to sovereign status. Therefore, the City of Sherrill contends that the property is subject to the payment of real property taxes or reverts to the ownership of the taxing authority if assessed property taxes are not paid. The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the City of Sherrill in June 2005. The Oneida Indian Nation is attempting to put all land acquired to date in a federal land trust. All parties involved continue to pursue all legal options available.
   
  To date neither the original claim nor the motion to amend has had an adverse impact on the local economy or real property values. In addition, title insurance companies continue to underwrite policies in the land claim area with no change in premiums or underwriting standards. Oneida Savings Bank requires title insurance on all residential real estate loans, excluding home equity loans. Both the State of New York and the Oneidas have indicated in their respective communications that individual landowners will not be adversely affected by the ongoing litigation. Oneida Financial Corp. continues to monitor the situation.

     (a)
     Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal year (the “Evaluation Date”). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to the material information relating to us (or our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in our periodic SEC filings.
   
         
     (b)       
     Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
    
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
   
  All internal control systems have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.
   
       56
     Table of Contents
      
  Management assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 issues by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
   
  This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

  Oneida Financial Corp.
  Oneida, New York
   
   
  We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Oneida Financial Corp. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
   
  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
   
  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Oneida Financial Corp. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies
  Nature of Operations
  The consolidated financial statements include Oneida Financial Corp. (the "Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oneida Savings Bank (the “Bank”). Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Oneida Financial Corp. is a Maryland corporation. On July 7, 2010, Oneida Financial Corp. completed its conversion from the mutual holding company structure and the related public offering and is now a stock holding company that is fully owned by the public.  As a result of the conversion, the mutual holding company and former mid-tier holding company were merged into Oneida Financial Corp.  The Oneida Savings Bank (“Oneida Savings Bank”) is 100% owned by the Company and the Company is 100% owned by public stockholders.  The Company sold a total of 3,937,500 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in the subscription and community offerings, including 157,500 shares to the Oneida Savings Bank employee stock ownership plan.  All shares were sold at a price of $8.00 per share, raising $31.5 million in gross proceeds.  Conversion related expenses of $2.5 million were offset against the gross proceeds, resulting in $29.0 million of net proceeds.  Concurrent with the completion of the offering, shares of Oneida Financial Corp., a federal corporation, common stock owned by public stockholders were exchanged for 0.9136 shares of the Company’s common stock.  
  The Bank is located in Central New York with offices in the City of Oneida and Rome and the Villages of Cazenovia, Hamilton, Canastota, Camden, Chittenango, Bridgeport, Vernon and Westmoreland and owns two banking related subsidiaries; Oneida Preferred Funding Corporation (OPFC) and The State Bank of Chittenango (SBC). The Bank is engaged primarily in accepting deposits and providing various types of loans to the community. The Bank also provides trust and brokerage services. OPFC, a Real Estate Investment Trust, primarily engages in investing activities of residential and commercial real estate mortgages. SBC is a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary which is permitted to accept municipal deposit accounts from various municipalities, school districts and other public sources; a source of funds not available to the Bank under New York Law. The Bank also owns one insurance and financial services subsidiary; Bailey & Haskell Associates, Inc. (B&H) which has six central New York offices. The Bank also owns an employee benefits consulting and retirement plan administration firm, Benefit Consulting Group Inc. (BCG) which has an office in central New York. Workplace Health Solutions was established in January 2008 as a risk management company with services to help mitigate and prevent work related injuries. This subsidiary was developed to complement the products and services offered by our other subsidiaries with an overall philosophy of innovative risk management services.
  Subsequent Events
  The Company reviews subsequent events for recognition and disclosure.
  Use of Estimates
  To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. The allowance for loan losses, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets, the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment for securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost and fair values of financial instruments are particularly subject to change.

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  Cash and Cash Equivalents
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash, deposits with other financial institutions with original maturities fewer than 90 days and federal funds sold. Net cash flows are reported for customer loan and deposit transactions.
  Trading Assets
  Securities in which the fair value option has been elected are considered trading assets and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. The fair value option has been elected for common and preferred equity securities as they do not have stated maturity values and the fair value fluctuates with market changes. Interest and dividends are included in net interest income based on the contractual amount of interest income. Cash flows from the purchase and sale of securities for which the fair value option has been elected are shown as operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows.
  Investment Securities (including Mortgage-Backed Securities)
  Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments, except for mortgage backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.
  Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis.
  In order to determine OTTI for purchased beneficial interests that, on the purchase date, were not highly rated, the Company compares the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date to the current expected remaining cash flows. OTTI is deemed to have occurred if there has been an adverse change in the remaining expected future cash flows.	
  Loans Held for Sale
  Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings.

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  Loans Held for Sale (Continued)
  Mortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold.
  Loans
  Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of deferred origination fees and costs and the allowance for loan losses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the level-yield method without anticipating prepayments.
  Interest income on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Past due status is based on the contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days still on accrual include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified as impaired loans. A loan is moved to non-accrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy, typically after 90 days of non-payment.
  All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
  Concentration of Credit Risk
  Most of the Company’s business activity is with customers located throughout Madison and Oneida Counties. Therefore, the Company’s exposure to credit risk is significantly affected by changes in the economy in those counties.
  Allowance for Loan Losses
  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off.
  The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired.
  A loan is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which

  Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued)
  the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired.
  Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
  If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported, net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan’s existing rate or the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as consumer and residential real estate loans are collectively evaluated for impairment, and accordingly, they are not separately identified for impairment disclosures.
  Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loans effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net at the fair value of the collateral. For the troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, the Company determines the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.
  The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent 3 years. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. The following portfolio segments have been identified: commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, consumer loans, home equity loans and residential mortgages.
  Loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family residential properties generally are larger than one-to-four family residential loans and involve a greater degree of risk. Commercial and multi-family residential mortgage loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties or underlying businesses, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of commercial real estate loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.
  Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with residential and commercial real estate

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued)
  lending. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based, with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans may be collateralized by equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because equipment and other business assets may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. 
  Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one-to-four family mortgage loans. In addition, consumer loans expand the products and services we offer to meet the financial services needs of our customers. Consumer loans generally involve greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans because of the difference in the underlying
 collateral. Repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance because of the greater likelihood of damage to, loss of, or depreciation in the underlying collateral. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections depend on the borrower’s personal financial stability. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans.
  Home equity loans are secured by a borrower’s primary residence. Home equity loans are underwritten under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family fixed-rate loans. Home equity loans may be underwritten with a loan to value ratio of 90% when combined with the principal balance of an existing mortgage loan. Home equity loans generally involve greater credit risk than the primary residential mortgage loans due to the potential of declines in collateral values, collectability as a result of foreclosure processes if the Bank is considered to be in a secondary position as well as the amount of expenses incurred during the process.
  Residential real estate loans have as collateral a borrower’s primary residence. The risk of loss on these loans would be due to collateral deficiencies due to market deterioration or location and condition of the property. The foreclosure process of a primary residence is usually the final course of action on these types of loans. Given our underwriting criteria and the volume and balance of the loans as compared to collateral, the risk in this portfolio segment is less than that of the other segments.
  Mortgage Servicing Rights
  When mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value with the income statement effect recorded in servicing fee income. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. All classes of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying loans. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income, such as

  Mortgage Servicing Rights (Continued)
  the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillary income, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. The Company compares the valuation model inputs and results to published industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amounts. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights into groupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carrying amount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, a reduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase in income. The fair values of servicing rights are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.
  Servicing fee income which is reported on the income statement as other non-interest income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans. The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the 
outstanding principal; or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is netted against loan servicing fee income. Servicing fees totaled $431,033, $511,678 and $641,358 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
  Foreclosed Assets
  Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. These assets are subsequently accounted for at lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating costs after acquisition are expensed.
  Premises and Equipment
  Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Buildings and related components are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 5 to 39 years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method with useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred.
  Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Stock
  The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest additional amounts. FHLB stock is carried at cost and periodically evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income.
  Bank Owned Life Insurance
  The Company has purchased life insurance policies on certain key officers. Bank owned life insurance is recorded at the amount that can be realized under the insurance contract at the balance sheet date, which is the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement.

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
  Goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to January 1, 2009 represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill resulting from business combinations after January 1, 2009, is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests of the acquiree. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances exist that indicate that a goodwill impairment test should be performed. The Company has selected December 31 as the date to perform the annual impairment test. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet.
  Other intangible assets consist of core deposit and acquired customer relationship intangible assets arising from whole bank and other acquisitions. They are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized on an accelerated method over their estimated useful lives. Core deposit intangibles are being amortized over a range of 10 to 12 years and acquired customer relationship intangible over 5 years.
  Long Term Assets
  Premises and equipment, core deposit and other intangible assets, and other long-term assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value.
  Loan Commitments
  Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded.
  Stock-Based Compensation
  Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees, based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used for restricted stock awards.
  Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
  Income Taxes
  Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax

  examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.
  The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
  All companies included in the consolidated financial statements operate under tax sharing agreements and are allocated income taxes based on their operating income and applicable effective income tax rate. All amounts due to or from are settled annually.
  Insurance
  Commissions from sales of insurance are recorded as income when earned.
  Trust Department Assets
  Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of condition, since such items are not assets of the Company. Fees associated with providing trust management services are recorded as earned, and are included in Non-Interest Income. At December 31, 2011, the Bank maintained 518 trust/fiduciary accounts, with total assets of $110.8 million under management as compared to 539 trust/fiduciary accounts with $114.2 million of total assets at December 31, 2010.
  Employee Benefits
  Pension expense is the net of service and interest cost, return on plan assets and amortization of gains and losses not immediately recognized. Employee 401(k) expense is the amount of matching contributions. Deferred compensation allocates the benefits over years of service.
  Employee Stock Ownership Plan
  The cost of shares issued to the ESOP, but not yet allocated to participants, is shown as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. Compensation expense is based on the market price of shares as they are committed to be released to participant accounts. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares reduce retained earnings; dividends on unearned ESOP shares reduce debt and accrued interest.
  Earnings per Share
  Basic earnings per common share is net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding outstanding participating securities. ESOP shares are considered outstanding for the calculation unless unearned. All outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The Company has determined that its previously outstanding non-vested stock awards are participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under stock options and awards using the treasury stock method. Earnings and dividends per share are restated for all stock splits and stock dividends through the date of issuance of the financial statements.

  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
  Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale and changes in the funded status of pension plans which are also recognized as separate components of equity.
  Loss Contingencies
  Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.
  Restrictions on Cash
  The Bank is required to maintain a reserve balance, as established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The required average total reserve for the 14-day maintenance period for December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $850,000, which was represented by cash on hand or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank. Balances with the Federal Reserve Bank earn nominal interest.
  Equity
  Common stock has $0.01 par and 30,000,000 shares authorized. In addition, ten million shares of serial preferred stock were authorized. There is no serial preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2011.
  Dividend Restrictions
  Banking regulations require maintaining certain capital levels and may limit the dividends paid by the Bank to the holding company or by the holding company to shareholders.
  Treasury Stock
  Prior to the stock offering common stock that was purchased was classified as treasury stock and recorded at cost. The shares reissued during 2010 were issued upon the exercise of stock options at average cost. Effective with the stock offering and conversion, the Company became a Maryland Corporation which does not recognize treasury shares but considers common stock repurchases to result in the retirement of stock. The shares repurchased in 2011 were considered retired.
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
  Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in a separate note. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates.
  Segments
  Internal financial information is primarily reported and aggregated in four lines of business; banking, insurance, employee benefit consulting and risk management activities.

  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In December 2010, the FASB amended existing guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. This guidance requires that if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative, a qualitative assessment be performed to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Step 2 of the impairment test shall be performed if it is determined that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. The amendments in this guidance were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. The effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.
  In April 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance for assisting a creditor in determining whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. The amendments clarify the guidance for a creditor’s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. With regard to determining whether a concession has been granted, the ASU clarifies that creditors are precluded from using the effective interest method to determine whether a concession has been granted. In absence of using the effective interest method, a creditor must now focus on other considerations such as the value of the underlying collateral, evaluation of other collateral or guarantees, the debtor’s ability to access other funds at market rates, interest rate increases and whether the restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. This guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2011, and was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. For purpose of measuring impairment on newly identified troubled debt restructuring, the amendments were applied prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.
  In May 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements between U.S. and International accounting principles. Overall, the guidance is consistent with existing U.S accounting principles; however, there are some amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The amendments in this guidance are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
  In June 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements. The amendments in this guidance are effective as of the beginning of a fiscal reporting year and interim periods within that year that begins after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this amendment will change the presentation of the components of comprehensive income for the Company as part of the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity.

Summary                                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards (Continued)
  In September 2011, the FASB amended existing guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. The amendment permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing these events and circumstances, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011 if financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not been issued. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s operating results or financial condition.

  As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s security portfolio consisted of 354 securities, 36 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The majority of the unrealized losses are related to the Company’s agency, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate and trust preferred securities as discussed below.
  U.S. Agency and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the Small Business Administration guarantee the contractual cash flows of our agency and mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Our Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.
  At December 31, 2011, of the six U.S. Government sponsored enterprise agency and mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position in our available-for-sale portfolio, only one was in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality. The Company does not have the intent to sell these agency and mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
  Non-Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
  All of our non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations carry various amounts of credit enhancement. These securities were purchased based on the underlying loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio, credit scores, property type, location and the level of credit enhancement. Current characteristics of each security are reviewed regularly by management. If the level of credit

  loss coverage is sufficient; it indicates that we will receive all of the originally scheduled cash flows. 
  At December 31, 2011, the one non-agency collateralized mortgage obligation in an unrealized loss position was in a continuous unrealized loss position more than 12 months. It was rated Aaa or better at time of purchase. Including the security just disclosed, the Bank currently has two obligations totaling $1.4 million that based on the expected cash flows, delinquencies and credit support the Company has considered impaired and are currently below investment grade. The total impairment recorded during 2011 was $75,334. No impairment was recorded for 2010. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 on these two securities were $89,070 and $144,000 respectively. These securities remain available for sale at December 31, 2011.
  Corporate Debt Securities
  At December 31, 2011, of the 20 corporate debt securities in an unrealized loss position, five were in a continuous unrealized loss position of 12 months or more. We have assessed these securities and determined that the decline in fair value was temporary. In making this determination, we considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, the percentage decline in comparison with the securities’ amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and the delinquency or default rates based on the applicable bond ratings. In addition, we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery of their cost basis, which may be at maturity. Included in the five securities whose unrealized loss position exceeds 12 months was a $2.5 million Strats-
Goldman Sachs Corporation obligation, maturing February 15, 2034 which is a variable rate note based on the 6 month LIBOR. The current rate on the security is 1.77%. The unrealized loss was $1,190,000 and $914,000 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively. In addition to the items noted above, we reviewed capital ratios, public filings of the issuer and related trust documents in the review of the unrealized loss. Strats-Goldman Sachs Corporation is paying as agreed. The other four securities in a continuous unrealized loss position were finance sector corporate debt securities all rated above investment grade with variable interest rates that have maturities ranging from 2015 to 2020. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
  Trust Preferred Securities
  The Company currently has $3.6 million invested in nine trust preferred securities as of December 31, 2011 whose unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position exceeding 12 months or more. All of the trust preferred securities are pooled issuances. Of the $3.6 million, $976,000 has variable rates of interest. $3.6 million of the investments are on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2011. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 on the nine securities totaled $2.7 million and $3.5 million respectively. 
   
  The following table provides detailed information related to the trust preferred securities held as of December 31, 2011:

  The structuring of trust preferred securities generally provide for a waterfall approach to absorbing losses whereby lower tranches are initially impacted and more senior tranches are impacted after lower tranches can no longer absorb losses. Likewise, the waterfall approach also applies to principal and interest payments received, as senior tranches have priority over lower tranches in the receipt of payments. In addition, there may be multiple classes within a single tranche that react differently to assumptions utilized in cash flow models due to the different features of the class such as fixed rate, floating rate, or a combination of both. In determining the amount of “currently performing” collateral for purposes of the table above, the total amount of issuers’ balances outstanding have been reduced by the amount in deferral and default. Also, for some of the securities, management has further reduced the total performing balance for the effects of issuers’ subsequent announcements of their intent to defer on the next applicable payment, and for other relevant circumstances through the date of issuance of the financial statements. Management considered all such announcements and circumstances known to us in evaluating the pooled trust preferred securities for OTTI as of December 31, 2011. 
   
  In the table above, “Excess Subordination Defaults as % of Performing Collateral” (Excess Subordination Ratio) was calculated as follows: total face value of performing collateral minus face value of all outstanding note balances not subordinate to our investment, divided by total face value of performing collateral. The Excess Subordination Ratio measures the extent to which there may be tranches within each pooled trust preferred structure available to absorb credit losses before the Company’s securities would be adversely impacted. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the amount of deferrals and defaults on the pools described above rose significantly, which has resulted in

Investment                                                                   Securities and Mortgage-Backed Securities (Continued)
  substantial reductions in the amounts of performing collateral. As a result, the negative Excess Subordination Ratio percentages shown in the table signify there is no support from subordinate tranches available to absorb losses before the Company’s securities would be adversely impacted. A negative Subordination Ratio is not definitive, in isolation, for determining whether or not OTTI should be recorded for a pooled trust preferred security. Other factors affect the timing and amount of cash flows available for payments to the note holders (investors); including the excess interest paid by the issuers (the issuers typically pay higher rates of interest than are paid out to the note holders).
  The Company uses the OTTI evaluation model to compare the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimates to ensure there are no adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter. The OTTI model considers the structure and term of the trust preferred securities and the financial condition of the underlying issuers, the timing and amount of interest and principal payments of the underlying issuers, and the allocation of the payments to the note classes. The current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of underlying trust preferred securities. Assumptions used in the models are as follows: 
  
         
     Significant     inputs at December 31, 2011
       
      
      Annual     prepayment
     1%     annually
      Projected     severity of loss on current defaults
     100%
      Projected     severity of loss on current deferrals
     0%     - 80%
      Projected     severity of loss on specific deferrals
     0%     - 80%
      Projected     additional defaults:
     0.375%     applied annually
      Projected     severity of loss on additional defaults
     60     - 75%
      Present     value discount rates for OTTI
     3.66%     - 9.91%
      Present     value discount rates for fair value
     15%
 
    
  The discount rates range can vary depending on the index the instruments are tied to as well as the spread for each instrument. The Company uses market-based yield indicators as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates, and then adjusts the resulting discount rates on the basis of its credit and structural analysis of specific trust preferred securities. The Company looks principally to market yields to maturity for investment grade and non investment grade trust preferred securities for which there is an active and liquid market. The next step is to make a series of adjustments to reflect the differences that nevertheless exist between these products (both credit and structural) and, most importantly, to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences (both actual and projected) between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific trust preferred securities. In addition, utilization of the individual trust preferred investment’s interest crediting rate and if applicable, margin index, is utilized in calculating the expected cash flows. 
  Prepayments can occur at the discretion of the issuer on predetermined call increments. The call provision allows the issuer to prepay some or the entire outstanding debt obligation on the fifth year and every fifth year thereafter. Due to the general weakness of the financial sector and the regulatory requirements to maintain and increase the capitalization of U.S. banks, the Company concluded that the issuers were unlikely to prepay their outstanding debt obligation and thereby reducing their individual capital ratios during this continued difficult economic cycle.

  The Company reviews each issuer individually for projected future deferrals and defaults. The purpose of the individual issuer review is to determine if an individual issuer demonstrates a significant likelihood of potential deferral/default so as to require a further addition to the projected additional default percentages as outlined in the above table. This review includes obtaining quarterly financial information and monitoring news releases and pertinent information relative to those issuers. The Company specifically reviews certain financial ratios including Fitch Score and “Texas Ratio” as well as capital adequacy and participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program of each issuer. The Company believes the “Texas Ratio (“TR”)” is a prominent indicator of the stress a financial institution is experiencing. The TR is calculated by dividing nonperforming assets and loans, including past due 90 days or more, by the sum of tangible equity and loan loss reserves. Management judgmentally establishes various credit criteria, and combinations of credit criteria and those issuers meeting some combination of such criteria are considered additional deferrals as of the reporting date. Based on the results of this analysis, the Company ensures that actual deferrals/defaults as well as forecasted deferrals/defaults of specific institutions are appropriately factored into the cash flow projections for each security. The default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral were formed based on the evaluation of collateral credit and a review of historical default data and current/near term operating conditions. There is no recovery estimated for actual defaulted issuers. Projected deferrals are modeled in a consistent manner with actual deferrals. One of these securities was fully impaired in 2009. Our model indicated additional other-than-temporary impairment on three of these securities, which resulted from management projecting additional defaults or deferrals during the period.
  OTTI losses totaled $292,000 during 2011 which was recorded as expense. The other five trust preferred securities had no further other-than-temporary impairment in 2011. These eight securities remain classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2011. It is possible that the underlying collateral of these securities will perform worse than expectations including an increase in deferrals/defaults above projections, which may lead to adverse changes in cash flows on these securities and potential future OTTI losses. Events that may trigger material declines in fair value for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, such as significantly higher levels of defaults, and severity of loss on the underlying collateral and further illiquidity.

  Unrealized losses on other investments have not been recognized into income because the issuer(s) securities are of investment grade (except as indicated above), management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity.

Loans                                                                   Receivable (Continued)
  Credit Quality Indicators
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogenous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate with an outstanding relationship greater than $250,000. Homogenous loans are reviewed when appropriate given foreclosures, bankruptcies or relationships that include non-homogenous loans. For homogenous loan pools, such as residential mortgages, home equity and consumer loans, the Company uses the payment status to identify the credit risk in these loan portfolios. Payment status is reviewed on at least a monthly basis by the Company’s personnel and on a quarterly basis with respect to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis is performed on at least an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
  Special Mention.
 Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncovered, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution’s credit position at some future date. 	
  Substandard.
 Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debts. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
  Doubtful.
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.	
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated are either less than $250,000 or are included in groups of homogenous loans. Based on the most recent analysis performed (all loans graded within the past 12 months), the risk category by class of loans is as follows:

     Fair Value
 
   Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
  The Company uses the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument.
  Securities
: The fair values of trading securities and investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market price of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted cash flows are calculated using spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 
  Trust Preferred Securities which are issued by financial institutions and insurance companies were historically priced using Level 2 inputs. The decline in the level of observable inputs and market activity in this class of investments by the measurement date has been significant and resulted in unreliable external pricing. Broker pricing and bid/ask spreads, when available, vary widely. The once active market has become comparatively inactive. As such, these investments are now priced using Level 3 inputs.
  The Company has developed an internal model for pricing these securities. Information such as historical and current performance of the underlying collateral, deferral/default rates, collateral coverage ratios, break in yield calculations, cash flow projections, liquidity and credit premiums required by a market participant, and financial trend analysis with respect to the individual issuing financial institutions and insurance companies, are utilized in determining individual security valuations. Due to current market conditions as well as the limited trading activity of these securities, the market value of the securities is highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility.
  Non-rated local municipal securities which are Bond Anticipation Notes or other bonds were historically priced using level 2 inputs. The market activity for these types of instruments is localized within our own market. We are considering these to be more level 3 pricing due to the lack of certain brokers providing quotes on this type of security. The Company does obtain broker quotes as available and reviews past history of the contractual payments and financial condition of the municipalities in determining an appropriate market value for this type of security.

     Fair Value (Continued)
 
   Common and preferred equity securities are generally priced using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs due to the market activity of these types of securities. One of the preferred securities is considered level 3 pricing due to the limited trading activity of the individual security in the market and lack of certain brokers providing quotes on this type of security. The Company does obtain available, if any broker quotes, reviews past history of contractual payments and financial condition of the corporation in determining an appropriate market value for this type of security. 			
  Impaired Loans:
 Impaired commercial real estate loans that are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a principal balance of $836,000, with a valuation allowance of $661,000 at December 31, 2011 resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $563,000 for the year then ended. Impaired commercial real estate loans had a principal balance of $1.4 million with a valuation allowance of $98,000 as of December 31, 2010. Estimates of fair value used for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally is not observable in the marketplace and therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 3. Impaired commercial loans had a principal balance of $2.0 million with a valuation allowance of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2010 resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $1.6 million for the year then ended. This loan was charged off in April 2011. There were no impaired commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2011.
  Loan Servicing Rights:
 Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.
  Loans Held for Sale:
 Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments, from third party investors.

  The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows:
  Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully. The method for determining the fair values for securities were described previously. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits

     Fair Value (Continued)
 
   with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. Fair value of debt is based on current rates for similar financing. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The fair value of off-balance-sheet items is not considered material.

  During 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of Parsons, Cote & Company. Goodwill in the amount of $576,000 and intangible assets in the amount of $71,000 were recorded as part of the Parsons, Cote & Company acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, contingent purchase payments based on future performance levels may be made over a three-year period ending December 31, 2008. Additional goodwill in the amount of $84,245 was recorded for the contingent purchase payment made in 2009.
  During 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC. Goodwill in the amount of $2.5 million and other intangible assets in the amount of $1.1 million were recorded as part of the acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, contingent purchase payments based on future performance levels may be made over a five-year period ending December 31, 2010. Additional goodwill in the amount of $95,388, $117,520 and $135,417 was recorded for the contingent purchase payment made in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively based on performance through December 31, 2010. During 2011, $1.1 million of goodwill was transferred between the insurance activities and the benefit consulting activities which represented the movement of a segment of business that was transferred from Bailey and Haskell Associates, Inc. to Benefit Consulting Group LLC after the acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC.
  During 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of David Holmes Agency, Inc., an insurance agency operating in Utica, New York. The Company paid $361,718 in cash and established a note payable for $361,718 to be paid monthly over 24 months with interest at 3.00% per annum for fixed assets and other intangible assets. Goodwill in the amount of $586,445 and intangible assets in the amount of $136,991 were recorded in conjunction with the acquisition. David Holmes Agency, Inc has been subsequently merged into Bailey and Haskell Associates, Inc. During 2011, the Company paid $163,099 in principal and $7,919 in interest payments on the note.
  Impairment exists when a reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test. Management has identified that the Company has four reporting units, its banking unit, its insurance unit, its employee benefits consulting unit and its risk management activities unit. There is no goodwill attributable to the risk management activities unit. Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of each reporting unit, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units exceeds their fair value, we are required to perform a second step to the impairment test.

  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the ability to carry back deductions to prior periods when the deferred tax assets are realized and/or in generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on the Company’s history of taxable income and expected future taxable income, the Company has determined that a valuation allowance is not required.
  At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within the next twelve months.
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, there were no amounts accrued for interest and penalties.
  The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as New York state income tax. The Company is no longer subject to federal or state examinations for tax years prior to 2008. The tax years of 2008-2010 remain open to federal and state examination.
  During 2011, the Internal Revenue Service completed an examination of the 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns. The examination had no material impact on the financial statements. Additionally, during 2011, the State of New York completed an examination of the 2008 New York income tax return. The examination had no material impact on the financial statements.

     Benefit Plans
 
   The Bank provides a noncontributory defined benefit retirement accumulation plan (cash balance plan) covering substantially all employees. Under the plan, retirement benefits are primarily a function of the employee's years of service and level of compensation. As of June 15, 2004, the Bank had a plan amendment to freeze the plan benefits for plan participants. The Bank uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension plan. State Bank of Chittenango, a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary of Oneida Savings Bank, participated in the New York State Bankers

  Oneida Savings Bank Plan Assets
  The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 65% of investments for long-term growth and 35% for near-term benefit payments to preserve the long-term earnings power of the assets. The target allocations for plan assets are shown in the table below. Equity securities primarily include investments in common stock. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds, government issues and mortgage-backed securities. Other fixed income securities include a money market account and checking account.
  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends in the plan assets as well as projected future rates of return on those assets. The following assumptions were used in determining the long-term rate of return:
         
     Equity securities
     Dividend discount model, the smoothed     earnings yield model and the equity risk premium model

   The long term rate of return considers historical returns. There were no adjustments made to historical returns.
  The plan is prohibited from investing in the following investments or transactions: (1) commodities and futures; (2) warrants; (3) Eurobonds; (4) naked option transactions; (5) margin purchase securities; (6) private placements; (7) short sales of securities; (8) unregistered or restricted stock and (9) speculative derivatives. All assets selected for inclusion in the Portfolio must have a readily ascertainable market value and must be generally considered marketable at the time of purchase.

  State Bank of Chittenango Plan Assets
  The Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 97% of investments for long-term growth and 3% for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund managers. The target allocations for System assets are shown in the table below. Cash equivalents consist primarily of short term investment funds. Equity securities primarily include investments in common stock and depository receipts. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds, government issues and mortgage-backed securities. Other financial instruments primarily include rights and warrants.
  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends in the System’s assets as well as projected future rates of return on those assets and reasonable actuarial assumptions based on the guidance provided by ASOP No. 27 ”Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations” for long term inflation, and the real and nominal rate of investment return for a specific mix of asset classes. The following assumptions were used in determining the long-term rate of return:
         
     Equity     securities
     Dividend     discount model, the smoothed earnings yield model and the equity risk premium model
        
      
      
       
     Fixed     income securities
     Current     yield to maturity and forecasts of future yields
       
      
      
       
     Other     financial instruments
     Comparison     of the specific investment’s risk to that of fixed income and equity instruments and using judgment

     Benefit Plans (Continued)
 
   The long term rate of return considers historical returns. Adjustments were made to historical returns in order to reflect expectations of future returns. These adjustments were due to factor forecasts by economists and long-term U.S. Treasury yields to forecast long-term inflation. In addition, forecasts by economists and others for long-term GDP growth were factored into the development of assumptions for earnings growth and per capita income.
  Effective September 2011, the System revised its investment guidelines. The System currently prohibits its investment managers from purchasing any security greater than 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase or greater than 8% at market value in any one issuer. In addition the following are prohibited: (1) Equity security short sales, unregistered securities and margin purchases; (2) fixed income securities that are of Baa2/BBB quality or less, mortgage backed derivatives that have an inverse floating rate coupon or that are interest only securities, any asset backed security that is not issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies or its instrumentalities and securities of less than A-quality may not in the aggregate exceed 10% of the investment manager’s portfolio; and (3) other financial instruments such as unhedged currency exposure in countries not defined as “high income economies” by the World Bank. Prior to September 2011, investments in emerging countries as defined by Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Index and structured notes were prohibited. All other investments not prohibited by the System are permitted. At December 31, 2011, the System holds certain investments which are no longer deemed acceptable to acquire. These positions will be liquidated when the investment managers deem that such liquidation is in the best interest of the System.

     Benefit Plans (Continued)
 
   Employees may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation, with the Company matching the contribution up to 5% of compensation. Employer contributions associated with the plan amounted to $655,808, $622,681 and $570,401 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
  The Bank provides The Oneida Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) with all employees meeting the age and service requirements eligible to participate in the Plan. Employees are eligible for the Plan if they are twenty-one years of age and have one year of service with at least 1,000 hours. The ESOP purchased 157,500 shares of common stock as part of the second step conversion (see Footnote 22) which was funded by a loan from the Company payable in ten equal installments over 10 years bearing a variable interest rate of prime at the beginning of the year which was 3.25% for 2011 and 2010. Loan payments are to be funded by cash contributions from the Bank. The loan can be prepaid without penalty. Shares purchased by the ESOP are maintained in a suspense account and held for allocation among the participants. As loan payments are made, shares are committed to be released and subsequently allocated to employee accounts at each calendar year end. Compensation expense is recognized related to the shares committed to be released based on the average market price during the period. Cash dividends received on unallocated shares are used to pay debt service. For the purpose of computing earnings per share, unallocated ESOP shares are not considered outstanding. Contributions to the ESOP during 2011 and 2010 were $288,538 and $331,100 respectively. Expense recorded for 2011 and 2010 was $343,042 and $302,739 respectively. In 2009, the Company made a discretionary contribution to the plan and recorded compensation expense of $300,000 for the plan to purchase additional shares to allocate to participants.
  Shares held by the ESOP were as follows:

     Stock Based Compensation Plans
 
   The Company had two share based compensation plans as described below. Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for those plans was $185,598 and $258,830 for 2010, and 2009. The total income tax benefit was $71,455 and $99,649. Both plans were final in 2010; therefore there was no activity or expense associated with them for 2011.
  Stock Option Plan
  The Company’s 2000 Stock Option Plan, which was shareholder approved, permitted the granting of share options to its directors, officer and key employees for up to 342,205 share of common stock. The exercise price of options granted was equal to the market value of the Company’s shares at the date of grant; those options vest and become exercisable ratably over a one to five-year period. The plan also has a reload feature which entitles the option holder, who has delivered common stock as payment of the exercise price for option stock, to a new option to acquire additional shares in the amount equal to the shares traded in. The option period during which the

     Stock Based Compensation Plans (Continued)
 
   reload option may be exercised expires at the same time as that of the original option that the holder has exercised. The Company has a policy of using shares held as treasury stock to satisfy share option exercises. Compensation recorded in conjunction with these plans was $13,102 and $78,543 for 2010, and 2009, respectively. All options granted expired April 2010.
  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Company’s common stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of grant date:

  Recognition Plan
  The Management Recognition and Retention Plan provides for the issuance of shares of restricted stock to directors, officers and key employees. Compensation expense equal to the market value of Oneida Financial Corp.’s stock on the grant date is recognized ratably over the five year vesting period for shares of restricted stock granted that were fully vested at December 31, 2010. Compensation recorded in conjunction with these plans was $172,496 and $180,287 for 2010 and 2009 respectively. There were no shares available for future awards as of December 31, 2010. Shares unallocated under the plan available for future awards were 10,311 as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $124,658 and $146,780 respectively.

Commitments
  Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance-sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.
  The contractual amounts of financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk at year end were as follows:

Commitments                                                                    (Continued)
  Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 60 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.75% and maturities ranging from 15 years to 30 years. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but includes residential and commercial real estate.
        15.
     Dividends and Restrictions
 
   The Company’s principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the New York State Banking. In addition to state law requirements and the capital requirements discussed below, the circumstances under which the Bank may pay dividends are limited by federal statutes, regulations, and policies. Retained earnings of the Bank are subject to certain restrictions under New York State Banking regulations. The amount of retained earnings legally available for dividends under these regulations was $9,915,343 and $6,162,202 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively.
  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are authorized to determine under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The payment of dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that banking organizations could generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
        16.
     Regulatory Matters
 
   The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2011, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
  Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At year-end 2011 and 2010, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institution’s category.

  The Qualified Thrift Lender test requires at least 65% of assets be maintained in housing-related finance and other specified areas. If this test is not met, limits are placed on growth, branching, new investments, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and new dividends. Management believes this test is met.

     Conversion and Reorganization
 
   On February 9, 2010, the Board of Directors of Oneida Financial, MHC (“MHC”), the Company and Oneida Savings Bank (“Bank”) adopted a Plan of Conversion and Agreement and Plan of Reorganization under the terms of which the Company undertook a “second step” conversion (the “Conversion”), and the Bank reorganized from the two-tier mutual holding company structure to the stock holding company structure. Prior to the completion of the Conversion, the MHC owned approximately 55.0% of the common stock of the Company.
  In connection with the Conversion, the outstanding shares of Oneida Financial Corp owned by the MHC were sold to the depositors of Oneida Savings Bank and other public investors. Completion of the Conversion and Offering resulted in the issuance of 7,164,794 shares of common stock. A total of 3,937,500 shares were sold in the subscription, community and syndicated offerings, at $8.00 per share. An additional 3,227,294 shares were issued to the former public stockholders of the Company based upon an exchange ratio of 0.9136 new shares for each share of Oneida Financial Corp common stock held at the close of business on July 7, 2010. Common shares held by the Company’s ESOP and Recognition and Retention Plan prior the conversion were also exchanged using the conversion ratio of 0.9136. The Conversion was accounted for as a change in corporate form with no resulting change in the historical basis of the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity. Costs related to the Offering, primarily marketing fees paid to the Company’s investment banking firm, professional fees, registration fees, printing and mailing costs were $2.5 million and

     Conversion and Reorganization (Continued)
 
   accordingly, net proceeds were $27.7 million. In addition, as part of the conversion and dissolution of the MHC, the Company received $36,000 of cash previously held by the MHC. As a result of the Conversion and offering, Oneida Financial Corp. was succeeded by a new, fully public, Maryland corporation with the same name and the MHC ceased to exist.
  Also pursuant to the plan of conversion, a liquidation account was created by the Holding Company for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders (as those terms are defined in the plan of conversion) in an amount equal to (i) the MHC’s ownership interest in the Company’s total stockholders’ equity as of the date of the latest statement of financial condition used in the prospectus plus (ii) the value of the net assets of the MHC as of the date of the latest statement of financial condition of the MHC used in the prospectus. The plan of conversion also provides the establishment of a bank liquidation account at the Bank to support the Holding Company’s liquidation account. The liquidation account is designed to provide payments to depositors of their liquidation interests in the event of a liquidation of the Holding Company and the Bank or a liquidation solely of the Bank. Specifically, in the unlikely event that either the Bank or the Holding Company and the Bank were to liquidate after the conversion, all claims of creditors, including those of depositors, would be paid first, followed by distribution to eligible depositors of their interests in the liquidation account maintained by the Holding Company.

  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
  and Results of Operations 
    
   
  This section presents Management’s Discussion and Analysis of and Changes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations and should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements and notes thereto included herein.
   
  When used in this Annual Report the words or phrases “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “estimate,” “project” or similar expressions are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, changes in economic conditions in the Company’s market area, changes in policies by regulatory agencies, fluctuations in interest rates, demand for loans in the Company’s market area and competition, that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated or projected. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the Company’s financial performance and could cause the Company’s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements.
   
  The Company does not undertake, and specifically declines any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.
 This discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Oneida Financial Corp. provided in the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the financial statements.
   
  Overview – The Companies
   
  Oneida Financial Corp. (“Company”) is a Maryland corporation that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Oneida Savings Bank. In 2010 Oneida Financial MHC (the former mutual holding parent company) converted from mutual to stock form (the “Conversion”). In connection with the Conversion the 55.0% ownership position of Oneida Financial MHC was sold to depositors of the Bank and the public (the “Offering”). Upon completion of the Conversion and Offering, the Company issued 7,164,794 shares of common stock. A total of 3,937,500 shares were sold in the offering at $8.00 per share, and an additional 3,227,294 shares were issued to former public stockholders of the Company’s predecessor based on an exchange ratio of 0.9136 shares of the Company’s stock for each share of old Oneida Financial Corp. common stock held as of the close of business on July 6, 2010. Following the completion of the Conversion and Offering, Oneida Financial MHC ceased to exist.

.
   
  Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents), and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances and other borrowings. Net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, as well as a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets compared to interest-bearing liabilities. Also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income, which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services, fees from our insurance agency, benefits consulting and risk management subsidiaries and fees from trust services, and net gains and losses on sale of investments. Interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for loan losses, general administrative and other expenses, including employee compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment costs, as well as by state and federal income tax expense.
   
  Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly with respect to changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.

  Oneida Savings Bank. 
Oneida Savings Bank is a New York chartered savings bank headquartered in Oneida, New York. Oneida Savings Bank was originally founded in 1866 as a mutual (meaning no stockholders) savings bank. In 1998, Oneida Savings Bank converted to a New York chartered stock savings bank. Since 1998 the Bank has grown its traditional community banking franchise organically and through acquisitions of banks and nonbank companies that offer insurance sales, financial services, employee benefits consulting and other risk management products and services. The expansion into insurance and other financial services businesses has enabled Oneida Savings Bank to evolve from a traditional savings bank to a full-service financial services organization.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Oneida Savings Bank is a community bank engaged primarily in the business of accepting deposits from customers through its main office and 11 full-service branch offices and using those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, to make one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate loans, consumer loans and commercial business loans and to invest in mortgage-backed and other securities. In November 2011, Oneida Savings Bank opened its eleventh full service branch office located in Rome, New York. Municipal deposit banking services are provided through a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary, The State Bank of Chittenango. Oneida Savings Bank also sells insurance and other commercial services and products through Bailey & Haskell Associates, Inc., its wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary, and provides employee benefits consulting services through Benefit Consulting Group, Inc., its wholly owned consulting services subsidiary. In addition, Oneida Savings Bank provides risk management services to help mitigate and prevent work related injuries through its wholly owned subsidiary Workplace Health Solutions, Inc. Oneida Savings Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank’s executive offices are located at 182 Main Street, Oneida, New York 13421. Its telephone number at this address is (315) 363-2000 and its website address is www.oneidabank.com.
   
  The State Bank of Chittenango. 
The State Bank of Chittenango is a New York chartered limited purpose commercial bank headquartered in Chittenango, New York. Oneida Savings Bank acquired State Bank of Chittenango in 2002 and retained the municipal banking operations of the bank in a limited purpose wholly owned subsidiary. New York State law prohibits a savings bank from directly soliciting and servicing public funds (deposits of counties, cities, towns, school districts, etc.). Holding State Bank of Chittenango as a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary has enabled us to offer municipal deposit banking services throughout our market area.
   
  Bailey & Haskell Associates.

   Business Strategy
   
  In guiding our operations, we seek to implement various strategies designed to enhance the institution’s profitability consistent with safety and soundness considerations. These strategies include a continuing focus on our community banking franchise while distinguishing our company as a complete financial services provider, and by promoting and continuing to expand our insurance, consulting and risk management businesses. We believe these strategies will enable us to continue to grow our assets, while providing superior service to our customers, remaining focused on high asset quality, continuing to grow and diversify revenue and generating favorable returns to our stockholders. The following are the key elements of our business strategy:
   
  Continuing Our Community Oriented Focus
.
 We have been committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities we serve and providing quality service to our customers. We believe we can be more effective than many of our competitors in serving our customers because of our ability to promptly and effectively respond to customer needs and inquiries. Our ability to succeed in our communities is enhanced by the stability of senior management. Senior management has an average tenure with Oneida Savings Bank of over 20 years and each individual who comprises senior management has over 25 years experience in the banking industry.
   
  Our community focus is further supported by the community service activities of our employees and the charitable activities of The Oneida Savings Bank Charitable Foundation. Our foundation was established in December 1998 in connection with our initial public offering. The foundation provides funds to eligible nonprofit organizations to help them carry out unique, innovative projects in specific fields of interest. The foundation’s goal is to fund projects that will enhance the quality of life in the communities served by Oneida Savings Bank.
   
  Expanding Our Geographic Reach
.
 Since 1998, we have grown our traditional community banking franchise organically and through acquisitions of banks and nonbank businesses that offer trust services, insurance sales, financial services, employee benefits consulting and risk management services. The expansion into insurance and other financial services businesses has enabled Oneida Savings Bank to evolve from a traditional savings bank to a full-service financial services organization. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to grow our business through a combination of de novo branching and complementary acquisitions in our existing market and contiguous markets. We will consider acquisition opportunities that expand our geographic reach in banking, insurance or other complementary financial service businesses, although we do not currently have any agreements or understandings regarding any specific acquisition.
   
  Continuing to Improve Earnings and Diversify Income Sources. 
We continue to seek ways of increasing our income by increasing our fee income and other sources of non-interest income through traditional banking sources and insurance and financial services businesses.
   
         
     ·
        
     Community Banking. We continue to actively market our core banking products to attract new fee-based deposit accounts and checking account related services to new and existing customers. We offer our customers internet banking, an account overdraft program, e-commerce capabilities and debit cards as an account retention tool and to increase non-interest income. These products and services represent continuing sources of fee income. We also emphasize our trust department services with the expectation that fees generated by the trust department will increase as the assets under management grow. In addition, we receive fee income from servicing loans sold in the secondary market.
 
           
     ·
        
     Financial Service Subsidiaries. 
In recent years, we have increased the services and products we offer through our insurance agency, benefits consulting, and risk management subsidiaries. We initially entered the insurance and financial services business with the acquisition in October 2000 of Bailey & Haskell Associates, Inc. The expansion of our financial services business has continued to provide an increasing revenue source. We intend to continue to expand our financial services businesses to increase our earnings and diversify our revenue sources
 
   Growing Our Loan Portfolios.
 We intend to grow our loan portfolios while continuing to exercise prudent loan underwriting and administration standards.

     Emphasizing Origination of Commercial Real Estate, Consumer and Commercial Business Loans. 
We have sought to increase commercial real estate, consumer and commercial business lending in a controlled, safe and sound manner. Because these loans generally have higher yields and shorter terms than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, our goal is to increase the origination of these loans consistent with safety and soundness considerations. At December 31, 2011, our loan portfolio was composed of 28.5% commercial real estate loans, 11.9% consumer loans and 13.1% commercial business loans.
 
           
     ·
        
     Continuing the Origination of One-to-Four Family Real Estate Loans. 
Historically, Oneida Savings Bank has emphasized the origination of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans within Madison and Oneida counties and the surrounding counties. During 2011, our one-to-four family mortgage loan originations have been primarily fixed-rate loans. We generally sell our fixed-rate one-to-four family loan originations and such loans are sold without recourse and on a servicing-retained basis. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we sold $25.5 million and $36.7 million, respectively, in fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans. In addition, adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans and hybrid ARM loans, which have a fixed rate of interest for the first three to five years and adjust annually thereafter, represented a lower percentage of total originations. Residential real estate loan origination volume, particularly fixed-rate originations, continued to decrease during 2011 compared with 2010 and 2009 due to a reduction in the volume of refinancing and new loan origination.
 
   Continuing Our Conservative Underwriting Standards and Maintaining our Strong Asset Quality.
 We continue to maintain strong asset quality and reserve coverage. At December 31, 2011, our non-performing loans totaled $1.4 million or 0.5% of total loans and our ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 201.81%. At December 31, 2010, our non-performing loans totaled $4.0 million or 1.38% of total loans and our ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans was 107.54%. The decrease in the non-performing loans was primarily attributable to the charge-off of a fully reserved, impaired, unsecured commercial loan with a principal balance of $2.0 million in April 2011. Of the $1.4 million of non-performing loans, $836,000 represents a commercial lending relationship which has been considered to be impaired and a specific allowance of $661,000 has been established at December 31, 2011. Our asset quality reflects our conservative underwriting standards, the diligence and experience of our loan collection personnel and the stability of the local economy. As part of our evaluation of our asset quality, we also use an independent third party loan review firm to evaluate certain parts of the loan portfolio on a semiannual basis. Finally, we have not and do not plan to originate or participate in any sub-prime or Alt-A lending programs or loans.
  Growing Our Core Deposit Base. 
Oneida Savings Bank is a market leader in offering deposit accounts in the communities we serve. We continue to emphasize offering core deposits to individuals, businesses and municipalities located in our market area. Core deposits represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross sell the products and services of our complementary subsidiaries. Core deposits are our least costly source of funds which improves our interest rate spread and also contributes non-interest income from account related services.
   
  Financial Condition
   
  Assets. 
Total assets at December 31, 2011 were $663.7 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 0.3%, from $661.6 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to an increase in loans receivable.
   
  Management continues to maintain a diversified loan portfolio mix. This strategy is supported through the origination and retention of consumer and commercial business loans with the intent of increasing the average yield on our interest-earning assets, and the origination for sale in the secondary market of lower yielding fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Total consumer, commercial business and commercial real estate loans decreased by $391,000 during 2011. The decrease in consumer, commercial business and commercial real estate loans was primarily due to a decrease in commercial lending and consumer loans partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans decreased partially due to the charge-off of a fully reserved, impaired, unsecured commercial loan with a principal balance of $2.0 million in April 2011 as well as a decrease in the outstanding balance on lines of credit. The decrease in consumer lending was largely attributable to a decrease in demand, particularly in automobile lending. Residential real estate loans decreased $1.7 million during 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, a total of $25.5 million in fixed-rate residential mortgage loans were sold compared with loan sales of $36.7 million during 2010.
   
  Oneida Savings Bank reinvests proceeds from loan sales and investment sales and investment security maturities in other loans as new loan origination volume warrants. Investment and mortgage-backed securities provide improved liquidity
  
       66
      
       
  as compared with individual mortgage loans thereby allowing Oneida Savings Bank to accommodate periods of increased loan demand.
  Mortgage-backed securities increased $2.9 million, or 3.2%, to $92.8 million at December 31, 2011 as compared with $89.9 million at December 31, 2010. Investment securities decreased $10.0 million, or 6.2%, to $151.7 million at December 31, 2011 as compared to $161.7 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in investment securities was primarily the result of the increase in loans receivable and cash and cash equivalents due to the timing of the reinvestment of call and maturity proceeds.
  Trading securities decreased $681,000, or 8.9%, to $7.0 million at December 31, 2011 as compared with $7.7 million at December 31, 2010 and represent common and preferred equity securities that we have elected to adjust to fair value. The decrease in trading securities was due to the sale of preferred securities during the year offset by the increase in fair value during 2011 that was reflected through the income statement.
  Cash and cash equivalents increased $6.9 million, or 20.5%, to $40.6 million at December 31, 2011 from $33.7 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to the timing of reinvesting excess cash in investment and mortgage-backed securities.
  Oneida Financial Corp. invests in bank-owned life insurance to provide a funding source for benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides non-interest income that is nontaxable. Federal regulations generally limit the investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of the sum of Oneida Savings Banks’ tier 1 capital and its allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2011, this limit was $16.0 million, and our investment in bank-owned life insurance at that date totaled $17.0 million. We exceeded the limit as a result of acquiring bank-owned life insurance as part of a small bank acquisition but have reduced the excess as a result of the increased capital from our stock offering and conversion.
  Liabilities. 
Total liabilities increased by $93,000, or 0.02%, to $575.8 million at December 31, 2011 from $575.7 million at December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in other liabilities of $2.6 million offset by a decrease in deposits of $1.6 million and a decrease in borrowings of $1.0 million.
  Deposit accounts decreased $1.6 million, or 0.3%, to $550.6 million at December 31, 2011 from $552.2 million at December 31, 2010. Interest-bearing deposit accounts decreased by $5.5 million, or 1.1%, to $481.5 million at December 31, 2011 from $487.0 million at December 31, 2010. Non-interest bearing deposit accounts increased $3.9 million, or 6.0%, to $69.1 million at December 31, 2011 from $65.2 million at December 31, 2010. Core deposit accounts which include checking, savings and money market accounts increased $10.3 million or 2.6%. Time deposits decreased $11.9 million or 7.8%. The increase in core deposit accounts was the result of an increase in municipal deposits offered through our limited purpose commercial banking subsidiary, State Bank of Chittenango, offset by a decrease in our retail deposits. Municipal deposits increased $1.6 million to $118.9 million at December 31, 2011 from $117.3 million at December 31, 2010.
  Borrowings decreased $1.0 million, or 8.3%, to $11.0 million at December 31, 2011 from $12.0 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease in borrowings was due to our decision not to renew a portion of the advances that matured during the year. At December 31, 2011, there were no overnight advances outstanding. Overnight advances are accessed from time to time to fund loan originations and short-term deposit outflows.
  Other liabilities increased $2.6 million, or 22.6%, to $14.1 million at December 31, 2011 from $11.5 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in other liabilities is primarily due to an increase in future dated commissions and premiums payable in our insurance subsidiary at December 31, 2011.
  Stockholders’ Equity.
 Total stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 was $88.0 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 2.4%, from $85.9 million at December 31, 2010. The change in total equity is the result of net income of $5.7 million combined with an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) of $4.1 million at December 31, 2011 resulting from an increase in the market value of mortgage-backed and investment securities and the change in the unrealized loss on pension benefits. Changes in interest rates and market volatility resulted in an increase in the net unrealized gain on our available-for-sale securities. Offsetting these increases in total equity was a reduction of $2.5 million due to the repurchase by the Bank of a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary, the repurchase of 249,224 shares of common stock of the Company and the declaration of cash dividends during the trailing twelve months.

  Analysis of Net Interest Income
  Oneida Savings Bank’s principal business has historically consisted of offering savings accounts and other deposits to the general public and using the funds from such deposits to make loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, as well as consumer and commercial business loans. Oneida Savings Bank also invests a significant portion of its assets in investment securities and mortgage-backed securities both of which have classifications of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. Our results of operations depend primarily upon net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is directly affected by changes in volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which support those assets, as well as the changing interest rates when differences exist in the repricing of assets and liabilities.

  	 Rate and Volume Analysis
.
 The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by current rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume) and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010
   
  General.
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $5.7 million compared to net income of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the basic net income per share was $0.82 as compared with the 2010 reported basic income per share of $0.53. The increase in net income is primarily the result of an increase in net interest income, an increase in net investment gains, an increase in the change in fair value of investment securities, an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses. These increases in income were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense and an increase in income tax provision during 2011 as compared with 2010.
   
  The 
net income from operations for the year ending December 31, 2011, which excludes non-cash impairment charges incurred on eight trust preferred securities and two privately issued collateralized mortgage obligation of $367,000 and the non-cash benefit to earnings recognized in connection with the increase in market value of our trading securities of $199,000, net of $42,000 in income taxes, was $5.9 million or $0.84 per basic share. This compares to net income from operations for the year ending December 31, 2010 of $5.6 million, or $0.79 per basic share. Net income excluding the non-cash charges and benefits to earnings increased due primarily to an increase in net interest income, an increase in non-interest income and a decrease in the provisions for loan losses, partially offset by a decrease in investment gains realized and an increase in non-interest expense and
  
       70
      
       
   
  income tax provisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a meaningful comparison of the underlying operational performance of our business, and facilitate investors’ assessments of business and performance trends in comparison to others in the financial services industry. In addition, we believe the exclusion of these items enables management to perform a more effective evaluation and comparison of our results and to assess the overall performance of our business in relation to our ongoing operations.
   
  Interest and Dividend Income.
 Interest and dividend income increased by $3,000, or 0.01%, to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest and fees on loans decreased by $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with the same period in 2010. Interest and dividend income on mortgage-backed and other investment securities increased $1.3 million to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Interest income earned on federal funds sold decreased $18,000 during 2011 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2010.
   
  The decrease in income on loans resulted from a decrease of 29 basis points in the average yield on loans to 5.43% from 5.72% as well as a decrease of $6.6 million in the average balance of loans to $287.1 million in 2011 from $293.7 million in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, residential real estate loans totaled $89.2 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from December 31, 2010. During 2011, a total of $25.5 million in fixed-rate residential real estate loans were sold in the secondary market. In addition, commercial real estate loans increased $4.4 million to $82.3 million at December 31, 2011 from $77.9 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, total loans receivable were $288.5 million as compared with $287.7 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of 0.3%. The decrease in the yield on loans is a result of continued lower market interest rates during 2011 as compared with 2010.
   
  The increase in interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities was the result of an increase of $57.4 million in the average balance of investment and mortgage-backed securities to $260.1 million at December 31, 2011 from $202.7 million at December 31, 2010 partially offset by a decrease of 26 basis points in the average yield earned to 3.02% from 3.28%. The increase in the average balance on investment and mortgage-backed securities is the result of the investment of the net proceeds of the Company’s stock offering during the second half of 2010.
  Interest income on federal funds sold decreased as a result of a decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold of $7.3 million to $24.6 million during the 2011 period as compared with $31.9 million at December 31, 2010 as well as a decrease of 3 basis points in the average yield. The decrease in the yield is due to decreases in interest rates paid on federal funds during the period. The decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold reflects a decision in 2010 to increase the total liquidity of Oneida Financial Corp. due to the temporary investment of stock proceeds.
  Income from equity securities increased $24,000 due to an increase in the average yield of 36 basis points from 4.09% as of December 31, 2010 to 4.45% as of December 31, 2011. The average balance decreased $64,000 from $7.4 million as of December 31, 2010 to $7.3 million as of December 31, 2011.
  Interest Expense
.
 Interest expense decreased $1.7 million, or 29.8%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest paid on deposit accounts during 2011 of $1.2 million, decreasing to $3.5 million during 2011 from $4.7 million during 2010. In addition, borrowing expense decreased to $503,000 for 2011 compared with $1.0 million for 2010.
  The decrease in interest expense paid on deposits was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits. Core deposits, including money market accounts, savings accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts, experienced an increase in the average balance of $40.7 million, or 13.5%, to $342.9 million at an average cost of 0.42% during 2011 from $302.2 million at an average cost of 0.69% during 2010. During the same period the average balance of time deposits decreased $5.9 million or 3.9%, to $146.8 million in 2011 from $152.7 million during 2010 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 30 basis points.
  The decrease in borrowing expense was due to the decrease in the average balance of borrowings outstanding in 2011 to $11.6 million as compared with $21.1 million during 2010. In addition, the average rate paid on borrowings decreased by 38 basis points to 4.35% for the 2011 period.
  
       71
      
       
   
  Provision for Loan Losses.
 Provision for loan losses decreased $600,000, or 36.4%, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with a provision of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced by the Company over the most recent 3 years. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability and depth of the lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.
   
  The decrease in the provision from 2010 to 2011 was primarily the result of the Company increasing a specific reserve for an impaired unsecured commercial relationship with a principal balance of $2.0 million to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2010 which was subsequently charged-off in the second quarter of 2011. This charge-off did not result in a significant increase in the provision for loan losses using the historical charge-off experience due to the nature of this relationship. The commercial loan portfolio is a small portfolio. Relationships over $250,000 as well as all commercial lines of credit are reviewed at least annually. This relationship was a commercial line of credit. The Bank does not have any other relationships in the type of business this borrower was in. All of our current lines of credit are rating higher than this relationship was and also carry minimal balances on their lines. In addition, the Bank has not taken any net charge-offs on this type of loan over the past five years. Given these circumstances, this charge-off was not considered as part of the actual loss history experienced by the Company when evaluating the allowance allocated to commercial loans at December 31, 2011 and the related provision for loan losses. Non-performing loans have decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011, totaling $1.4 million or 0.2% of total assets at December 31, 2011 compared with $4.0 million or 0.6% of total assets at December 31, 2010. The decrease is due in part to the charge off of the unsecured commercial relationship. Net charge-off activity for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.4 million as compared with $275,000 in net charge-offs during 2010. The balance of the allowance for loan losses was $2.9 million or 1.02% of loans receivable at December 31, 2011 compared with $4.3 million or 1.51% of loans receivable at December 31, 2010.
   
  Non-interest Income.
 Non-interest income increased by $1.8 million, or 7.9%, to $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
  Revenue derived from Oneida Savings Bank’s subsidiaries increased $1.9 million, or 10.9%, to $19.4 million during 2011 as compared with $17.5 million during 2010. Insurance subsidiary revenue of Bailey & Haskell Associates was $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with $10.5 million during 2010. The increase in insurance subsidiary revenue is primarily due to increased sales volume and a high level of account revenue retention from the prior year. Consulting activities of Benefit Consulting Group generated revenue of $6.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with $5.9 million during 2010. The increase in consulting revenue is primarily the result of an increase in employee benefit consulting services and increased pension administration revenue resulting from required pension plan amendments prepared for clients. Risk management activities of Workplace Health Solutions generated $1.3 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared with $1.0 million in revenue during 2010.
  Deposit account service fees remained stable at $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The combination of fee reductions and higher account balances currently maintained resulted in more stable deposit account service fee revenue.
  We experienced a decrease in income from the sale and servicing of fixed-rate residential real estate loans. Such income decreased to $919,000 during 2011 compared with $1.1 million during 2010. The decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the profit on sales of loans in 2011 as compared with 2010 due to the decrease in loan sales.
  Change in fair value of investments.
 We have identified the preferred and common equity securities we hold in the investment portfolio as trading securities and as such the change in fair value of these securities is reflected as a non-cash
  
       72
      
       
  adjustment through the income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2011 the market value of our trading securities increased $199,000 as compared with an increase of $103,000 in the 2010 period.
  Net investment Gains (Losses). 
 Net investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $58,000 as compared to net investment losses of $901,000 during 2010. The increase in net investment gains was the result of the decrease in the non-cash impairment charges. Non-cash impairment charges of $367,000 were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $2.4 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010 for eight trust preferred securities and two privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations which were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The trust preferred securities are diversified pools of collateralized debt obligations primarily issued by domestic financial institutions and their holding companies. Partially offsetting the non-cash impairment charges were investment gains resulting from our decision to realize a portion of the appreciation in our mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio resulting in net gains realized of $425,000 during 2011 and $1.5 million during 2010.
  Non-interest Expense.
 Non-interest expense increased by $2.1 million or 6.2% to $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses associated with our insurance agency and consulting subsidiaries associated with commissions paid concurrent with revenue increases.
  Salaries, wages and other compensation paid to the employees of Oneida Financial Corp. during 2011 was $23.1 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or 7.9%, as compared with compensation expense of $21.4 million during 2010. The increase in compensation expense was primarily the result of the increase in sales of insurance and other non-banking products through our subsidiaries resulting in an increase in commissions paid and employee benefit expense.
  Building occupancy and equipment expense decreased $159,000, or 3.2%, to $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $5.0 million during 2010. In October 2010, the Company sold the building and equipment that represented our South Utica Office.
  Other non-interest expense increased $680,000, or 9.5%, to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $7.2 million during 2010. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily the result of consultant or broker charges related to the sales of insurance and other non-banking products through our subsidiaries. Consultant or broker charges increased by $227,000, or 22.0%, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $1.0 million during 2010.
  Provision for Income Taxes.
 Provision for income taxes was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $1.0 million from the 2010 income tax provision recorded of $914,000. The increase in income tax provision reflects the increase in pre-tax income for 2011 as compared to 2010 as well as an increase in the effective tax rate for the 2011 period. The higher effective tax rate was due to changes in the Bank’s tax exempt and tax preferred investment income and overall tax rate in effect for the year.
  Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009
  General.
 Net income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $3.8 million compared to net income of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the basic net income per share was $0.53 as compared with the 2009 reported basic income per share of $0.58. The decrease in net income is primarily the result of an increase in provision for loan losses, a decrease in the change in fair value of investment securities and an increase in non-interest expense. These decreases in income were partially offset by an increase in net interest income, an increase in non-interest income, a decrease in net investment losses and a decrease in income tax provision during 2010 as compared with 2009.
  The 
net income from operations for the year ending December 31, 2010, which excludes non-cash impairment charges incurred on eight trust preferred securities and one privately issued collateralized mortgage obligation of $2.4 million and the non-cash benefit to earnings recognized in the connection with the increase in market value of our trading securities of $103,000, net of $454,000 in income taxes, was $5.6 million or $0.79 per basic share. This compares to net income from operations for the year ending December 31, 2009 of $4.6 million, or $0.64 per basic share. Net income excluding the non-cash charges and benefits to earnings increased due primarily to an increase in net interest income, an increase in investment gains realized and an increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense, provisions for loan losses and income tax provisions. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a meaningful comparison of the underlying operational performance of our business, and facilitate investors’ assessments of business and performance trends in comparison to others in the financial
  
       73
      
       
  services industry. In addition, we believe the exclusion of these items enables management to perform a more effective evaluation and comparison of our results and assess performance in relation to our ongoing operations.
   
  Interest and Dividend Income.
 Interest and dividend income decreased by $1.2 million, or 4.9%, to $23.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest and fees on loans decreased by $970,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with the same period in 2009. Interest and dividend income on mortgage-backed and other investment securities decreased $253,000 to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Interest income earned on federal funds sold increased $2,000 during 2010 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2009.
   
  The decrease in income on loans resulted from a decrease of 23 basis points in the average yield on loans to 5.72% from 5.95% as well as a decrease of $4.7 million in the average balance of loans to $293.7 million in 2010 from $298.4 million in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, residential real estate loans totaled $90.9 million, a decrease of $10.9 million from December 31, 2009. During 2010, a total of $36.7 million in fixed-rate residential real estate loans were sold in the secondary market. In addition, commercial real estate loans increased $5.8 million to $77.9 million at December 31, 2010 from $72.1 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, total loans receivable were $287.7 million as compared with $298.7 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of 3.7%. The decrease in the yield on loans is a result of continued lower market interest rates during 2010 as compared with 2009.
   
  The decrease in interest income from investment and mortgage-backed securities was the result of a decrease of 120 basis points in the average yield earned to 3.28% from 4.48% partially offset by an increase of $48.5 million in the average balance of investment and mortgage-backed securities to $202.7 million at December 31, 2010 from $154.2 million at December 31, 2009. The increase in the average balance on investment and mortgage-backed securities is the result of purchases during the year reflecting the increase in municipal deposits that require collateral to be pledged against the balances as well as the investment of the net proceeds of the Company’s stock offering.
  Interest income on federal funds sold increased as a result of an increase in the average balance of federal funds sold of $18.2 million to $31.9 million during the 2010 period as compared with $13.7 million at December 31, 2009 partially offset by a decrease of 15 basis points in the average yield. The decrease in the yield is due to decreases in interest rates paid on federal funds during the period. The increase in the average balance of federal funds sold reflects a decision in 2010 to increase the total liquidity of Oneida Financial Corp due to the temporary investment of stock proceeds.
  Income from equity securities increased $4,000 due to an increase in the average balance of $1.1 million from $6.3 million as of December 31, 2009 to $7.4 million as of December 31, 2010. The average yield decreased 65 basis points from 4.74% as of December 31, 2009 to 4.09% as of December 31, 2010.
  Interest Expense
.
 Interest expense decreased $1.9 million, or 25.0%, to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest paid on deposit accounts during 2010 of $1.2 million, decreasing to $4.7 million during 2010 from $5.9 million during 2009. In addition, borrowing expense decreased to $1.0 million for 2010 compared with $1.7 million for 2009.
  The decrease in interest expense paid on deposits was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of deposits. Core deposits, including money market accounts, savings accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts, experienced an increase in the average balance of $57.7 million, or 23.6%, to $302.2 million at an average cost of 0.69% during 2010 from $244.5 million at an average cost of 0.88% during 2009. During the same period the average balance of time deposits decreased $1.2 million or 0.8%, to $152.7 million in 2010 from $153.9 million during 2009 and the average rate paid on time deposits decreased 72 basis points.
   
  The decrease in borrowing expense was due to the decrease in the average balance of borrowings outstanding in the 2010 period to $21.1 million as compared with $36.2 million during the 2009 period, offset by a 5 basis point increase in the average rate paid on borrowed funds to 4.73% for the 2010 period.
   
  Provision for Loan Losses.
 Provision for loan losses increased $890,000, or 117.1%, to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with a provision of $760,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the provision from 2009 to 2010 was primarily the result of the Company increasing a specific reserve for an impaired unsecured commercial relationship with a principal balance of $2.0 million to $2.0 million as of December 31, 2010 as compared to $570,000
  
       74
      
       
  as of December 31, 2009. Non-performing loans have increased during the year ended December 31, 2010, totaling $4.0 million or 0.60% of total assets at December 31, 2010 compared with $551,000 or 0.09% of total assets at December 31, 2009. The increase is due in part to the impaired unsecured commercial relationship as well as an additional commercial relationship with two commercial mortgages totaling $1.4 million that is also considered impaired at December 31, 2010. This commercial relationship was considered impaired due to the contractual terms of the loans not being met as the properties that secure the loans are part of a settlement of an estate involving numerous parties. Net charge-off activity for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $275,000 as compared with $483,000 in net charge-offs during 2009. The balance of the allowance for loan losses was $4.3 million or 1.51% of loans receivable at December 31, 2010 compared with $2.9 million or 0.98% of loans receivable at December 31, 2009.
  Non-interest Income.
 Non-interest income increased by $2.0 million, or 9.6%, to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.
  Revenue derived from Oneida Savings Bank’s subsidiaries increased $1.7 million, or 10.8%, to $17.5 million during 2010 as compared with $15.8 million during 2009. Insurance subsidiary revenue of Bailey & Haskell Associates was $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with $9.7 million during 2009. The increase in insurance subsidiary revenue is primarily due to increased sales volume and a high level of account revenue retention from the prior year. Consulting activities of Benefit Consulting Group generated revenue of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with $5.7 million during 2009. The increase in consulting revenue is primarily the result of an increase in employee benefit consulting services and increased pension administration revenue resulting from required pension plan amendments prepared for clients. Risk management activities of Workplace Health Solutions generated $1.0 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared with $491,000 in revenue during 2009. The increase in risk management revenue was the result of continued client growth for this new subsidiary established at the beginning of 2008.
  Deposit account service fees remained stable at $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The combination of fee reductions and higher account balances currently maintained resulted in more stable deposit account service fee revenue.
  We experienced an increase in income from the sale and servicing of fixed-rate residential real estate loans. Such income increased to $1.1 million during 2010 compared with $985,000 during 2009. The increase is primarily the result of an increase in the profit on sales of loans in 2010 as compared with 2009.
  Change in fair value of investments.
 We have identified the preferred and common equity securities we hold in the investment portfolio as trading securities and as such the change in fair value of these securities is reflected as a non-cash adjustment through the income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2010 the market value of our trading securities increased $103,000 as compared with an increase of $1.7 million in the 2009 period.
  Net investment losses. 
 Net investment losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $901,000 as compared with net investment losses of $1.5 million during 2009. The net investment loss was the result of a non-cash impairment charge of $2.4 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $2.3 million recorded for the year ended December 31, 2009 for eight trust preferred securities and one privately issued collateralized mortgage obligation which were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The trust preferred securities are diversified pools of collateralized debt obligations primarily issued by domestic financial institutions and their holding companies. Partially offsetting the non-cash impairment charges were investment gains resulting from our decision to realize a portion of the appreciation in our mortgage-backed and investment securities portfolio resulting in net gains realized of $1.5 million during 2010 and $788,000 during 2009.
  Non-interest Expense.
 Non-interest expense increased by $1.4 million or 4.3% to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses associated with our insurance agency and consulting subsidiaries associated with commissions paid concurrent with revenue increases
  Salaries, wages and other compensation paid to the employees of Oneida Financial Corp. during 2010 was $21.4 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 4.9%, as compared with compensation expense of $20.4 million during 2009. The increase in compensation expense was primarily the result of the increase in sales of insurance and other non-banking products through our subsidiaries resulting in an increase in commissions paid and employee benefit expense. In 2006, Oneida Financial Corp. approved a Management Recognition and Retention Plan for directors, officers and key employees. The expense associated with this benefit was $172,000 for 2010 as compared with $180,000 in 2009.
  
       75
      
       
  Building occupancy and equipment expense increased $249,000, or 5.2%, to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $4.7 million during 2009.
  Other non-interest expense increased $147,000, or 2.1%, to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $7.0 million during 2009. The increase in other non-interest expense was primarily the result of consultant or broker charges related to the sales of insurance and other non-banking products through our subsidiaries. Consultant or broker charges increased by $251,000, or 32.1%, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $781,000 during 2009.
  Provision for Income Taxes.
 Provision for income taxes was $914,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of $297,000 from the 2009 income tax provision recorded of $1.2 million. The decrease in income tax provision reflects the decrease in effective tax rate for 2010 as compared with 2009. The lower effective tax rate was due to changes in the Bank’s tax exempt and tax preferred investment income and overall tax rate in effect for the year.
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies
  Oneida Financial Corp.’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation allowance to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques.
  The most significant accounting policies followed by Oneida Financial Corp. are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are recorded in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of trading securities and investment securities and the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost, actuarial assumptions associated with Oneida Financial Corp.’s pension plan and the fair value methodologies used to review the carrying value of goodwill to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.
  The allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the collateral value and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of the annual report.
  As of December 31, 2011, $47.2 million of securities were considered held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost on our statement of condition. Securities available-for-sale, which represented $197.3 million at December 31, 2011, are recorded at current market value on our statement of condition. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the deferred tax effect, are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Recorded values are based on prices obtained from nationally recognized resources or securities dealer’s valuations. We conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of the securities portfolios to determine if any declines in fair value are other than temporary. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of the impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other
  
       76
      
       
  comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis.
  Securities in which the fair value option has been elected, which include both common and preferred equity securities, are classified as trading assets and are recorded at fair value on our statement of condition. Changes in fair value are included in earnings.
  The estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets, including trading securities and securities available-for-sale. Fair values are determined based on third party sources, when available. Furthermore, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Fair values may be influenced by a number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates and the shape of the yield curve.
  Fair values for securities available-for-sale are typically based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities or level 3 values. Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information on how we determine level 3 values.
  The valuation of our obligation associated with pension plans utilizes various actuarial assumptions. These assumptions include discount rate and expected return on plan assets. Specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in Note 11.
  Although goodwill is not subject to amortization, we must test the carrying value for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets, including goodwill. Determining the fair value of reporting units requires us to use a high degree of subjective judgment. We utilize discounted cash flow valuation models that incorporate such variables as revenue growth rates, expense trends, interest rates, and terminal values. Management also reviews current acquisition multiples with consideration of market conditions surrounding those acquisitions. Management will compare multiples of revenue, EBITDA as well as book value as a determination of fair value. Future changes in the economic environment or operations of our reporting units could cause changes to these variables, which could result in impairment being identified.
  Management of Market Risk and Other Risks
  Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk, as the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process. We do not own any trading assets other than common and preferred equity securities classified as trading in accordance with fair value accounting. We do not engage in hedging transactions, such as interest rate swaps and caps, other than forward sale commitments on certain mortgage loan commitments. Our interest rate risk management program focuses primarily on evaluating and managing the composition of our assets and liabilities in the context of various interest rate scenarios. Factors beyond Management’s control, such as market interest rates and competition, also have an impact on interest income and interest expense.
  Interest Rate Risk.
 We have used the following strategies to manage interest rate risk: (i) emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans, adjustable-rate commercial mortgage loans, other business purpose loans and consumer loans consisting primarily of auto loans; (ii) selling substantially all newly originated longer-term fixed rate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans into the secondary market without recourse and on a servicing retained basis; (iii) seeking to increase and diversify our sources of revenue, particularly non-interest income and (iv) managing our investment activities in a prudent manner in the context of overall balance sheet asset/liability management. Investing in shorter-term securities will generally bear lower yields as compared to longer-term investments, but improves our position for increases in market interest rates and better matches the maturities of our certificate of deposit accounts. Certificates of deposit that mature in one year or less, at December 31, 2011 totaled $99.6 million, or 19.9% of total interest-bearing liabilities of which $5.8 million represents municipal deposits. Borrowed funds that mature in one year or less at December 31, 2011 totaled $5.0 million, or 1.0% of total interest-bearing liabilities. Management believes that this balanced approach to investing will reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and will enhance long-term profitability.
   
  Net Income and Portfolio Value Analysis
.
 Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a net income model and a net portfolio value (“NPV”) model which generates estimates of the change in our net income and NPV over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets and liabilities. The model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates and reinvestment rates.

  As of December 31, 2011, a 200 basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to have a positive impact of 2.56% on net interest income during 2012 while a 300 basis point increase in rates would have a negative impact of 0.18% on net interest income during 2012. This analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels, prepayment on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits and other assumptions, and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.
   
  There are certain shortcomings inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in net interest income and NPV requires the making of certain assumptions, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income in the table assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results.
   
  Credit Risk.
 Our loan and investment portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk. Credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, limiting exposure to any single industry or customer, collateral protection, standard lending and investment policies and loan underwriting criteria.
  Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to non-performing loans and charge-offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for loan losses. The policies governing non-performing loans and charge-offs are consistent with regulatory standards. We maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The evaluation of each element and the overall allowance are based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and include an assessment of individual problem loans, actual loss experience, current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas, including unemployment levels, and other pertinent factors, including regulatory guidance and general economic conditions.
  
       78
      
       
  While management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on information currently available, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions, delinquencies or loss rates, and management's intent with regard to asset disposition options. In addition, the allowance for loan losses is periodically reviewed by the bank regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process. Based on their review, the agencies may require us to adjust the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their review.
  The securities investment policy is established by the Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets and desired risk parameters. In pursuing these objectives, management considers the ability of an investment to provide earnings consistent with factors of quality, maturity, marketability and risk diversification. We will only purchase securities rated as investment grade by a nationally recognized investment rating agency. The ability of an issuer of a corporate debt instrument to repay the obligation is influenced by a number of factors including general economic conditions, cash flow, events in specific industries, regional crisis, bankruptcy and many other factors. Corporate bonds are not typically guaranteed beyond their ability to repay and therefore may result in a loss to us if conditions change from those in place at the time the investment was acquired. We conduct a quarterly evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in fair value are other-than-temporary. Part of this analysis includes forecasting of rate projections and investment spreads over bond indices as compared to historical performance. Fluctuations in market conditions could impact the evaluation and outcome of projections.
  Concentration Risk. 
 Our lending activities are primarily conducted in Madison and Oneida Counties, located in Central New York State, and the adjacent counties. Our mortgage loan portfolio, consisting primarily of loans on residential real property located in its market area, is subject to risks associated with the local economy. If the local economy, national economy or real estate market weakens, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. A weakening in the local real estate market or a decline in the local economy could increase the number of delinquent or non-performing loans and reduce the value of the collateral securing such loans, which would reduce our net income.
  Legal Proceedings.
 We and our subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. For a complete discussion see our Annual Report on Form 10-K “ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”.
  Liquidity Risk.
 The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as the operating cash needs of our business, are met, taking into account all on- and off-balance sheet funding demands. Liquidity management also includes ensuring cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. We maintain a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk. The policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity requirements which comply with regulatory guidance. The policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or a systemic financial market crisis. The liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the Asset/Liability Management Committee.
  Our primary sources of funds are deposits; FHLB borrowings; proceeds from the principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage-related debt and equity securities; and to a lesser extent, proceeds from the sale of fixed rate residential real estate loans and additional borrowing ability available as needed. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, mortgage prepayments, mortgage loan sales and borrowings are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.
  Liquidity management is both a short-term and long-term responsibility of management. We adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon management’s assessment of (i) expected loan demand, (ii) projected purchases of investment and mortgage-backed securities, (iii) acquisition activities, (iv) expected deposit flows, (v) yields available on interest-bearing deposits, and (vi) liquidity of its asset/liability management program. Excess liquidity is generally invested in interest-earning overnight deposits, federal funds sold and other short-term U.S. agency obligations. At December 31, 2011, cash and interest-earning deposits totaled $40.6 million, or 6.1% of total assets.
  If Oneida Savings Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, it has the ability to borrow funds from the FHLB. Oneida Savings Bank may borrow from the FHLB under a blanket agreement, which assigns all investments in FHLB stock as well as qualifying first mortgage loans equal to 150% of the outstanding balance as collateral to secure the amounts borrowed. At December 31, 2011, Oneida Savings Bank has available $52.6 million of overnight borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011. In addition, we can utilize investment and mortgage-backed securities as collateral for repurchase agreements. We also maintain lines of credit with various commercial banks as an additional source of short-term borrowing. At December 31, 2011 we had approximately $20.0 million available to us under these borrowing arrangements.
  
       79
      
       
  We must also maintain adequate levels of liquidity to satisfy loan commitments. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of $72.1 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet current loan commitments.
  Certificates of deposit, which are scheduled to mature in one year or less from December 31, 2011, totaled $99.6 million of which $5.8 million represent municipal deposits. Based upon our experience and current pricing strategy, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with the Bank. Deposits less than $100,000 totaled $281.2 million at December 31, 2011.
  Management believes that our liquidity policies and sources are effective to satisfy current and anticipated financial commitments.
  Capital Requirements. 
The FDIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines to which Oneida Savings Bank is subject. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Oneida Savings Bank is required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk-weighted assets. The ratio of such regulatory capital to regulatory risk-weighted assets is referred to as the Bank’s “risk-based capital ratio.” Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet items to four risk-weighted categories ranging from 0% to 100%, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk.
  These guidelines divide a savings bank’s capital into two tiers. The first tier (“Tier I”) includes common equity, retained earnings, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (excluding auction rate issues) and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships subject to certain limitations). Supplementary (“Tier II”) capital includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less required deductions.
  Based on the foregoing, Oneida Savings Bank is currently classified as a “well capitalized” savings institution. The following table sets forth information regarding Oneida Savings Bank’s capital levels as of December 31, 2011.

  Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. 
We have various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments.
   
  Contractual Obligations:
 The following table presents as of December 31, 2011, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date. Further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements.

  Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
 In the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, held for purposes other than trading. The financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, for loan commitments and standby letters of credit, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments, assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that collateral or other security is of no value. We use the same credit policies in making such commitments as we do for on-balance sheet loans. The amount of
   
       80
      
       
  
  collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. Commitments to originate loans, unused lines of credit, and unadvanced portions of construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the amounts presented below do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments that we issue to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party. These guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers.
   
  The following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011. Further discussion of these commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

  Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices
  Our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

  As of December 31, 2011, there were 6,913,049 shares of the Company’s common stock issued and approximately 1,316 shareholders of record. The shareholders of record include banks and brokers who act as nominees, each of whom may represent more than one shareholder.
   
  The Board of Directors of the Company declared four quarterly cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2011. The table above represents the payment of the cash dividends. With the second step conversion in 2010, the Board moved to a quarterly dividend payment instead of a semiannual payment. The Board will review the dividend regularly and expects to maintain a regular quarterly dividend in the future, dependent upon the Company’s earnings, financial condition and other factors. The Company relies in part on dividends from the Bank to fund the payment of dividends to Company stockholders. See Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends.
   
  Stock Performance Graph.
 Set forth hereunder is a stock performance graph comparing (a) the cumulative total return on the Common Stock for the period beginning December 31, 2006, as reported by the Nasdaq Market, through December 31, 2011, (b) the cumulative total return on stocks included in the S&P 500 Index over such period, (c) the cumulative total return on stocks included in the Nasdaq Bank Index over such period, and (d) the cumulative total return of publicly traded thrifts or thrift holding companies located in the Mid-Atlantic Region over such period. Cumulative return assumes the reinvestment of dividends, and is expressed in dollars based on an assumed investment of $100. The graph reflects stock price information for the Company since July 7, 2010, and for the Company’s predecessor prior to that date, and reflects the impact of the exchange ratio used in the conversion for the period prior to July 7, 2010.

     a)   
     designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;
 
          
     b)   
     designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and
 
          
     c)   
     evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
 
          
     d)   
     disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; and
 
    
   
5.
The registrant’s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
   
   
         
     a)    
     all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
 
    
         
     b)    
     any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

In making this determination, we considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, thepercentage decline in comparison with the securities&#146; amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and thedelinquency or default rates based on the applicable bond ratings. In addition, we do not have the intent to sell thesesecurities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before their anticipatedrecovery of their cost basis, which may be at maturity. Included in the five securities whose unrealized loss positionexceeds 12 months was a $2.5 million Strats-</font>Goldman Sachs Corporation obligation, maturing February 15, 2034 which isa variable rate note based on the 6 month LIBOR. The current rate on the security is 1.77%. The unrealized loss was$1,190,000 and $914,000 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively. In addition to the items noted above, wereviewed capital ratios, public filings of the issuer and related trust documents in the review of the unrealized loss.Strats-Goldman Sachs Corporation is paying as agreed.

Likewise, the waterfallapproach also applies to principal and interest payments received, as senior tranches have priority over lower tranches in thereceipt of payments. In addition, there may be multiple classes within a single tranche that react differently to assumptions utilizedin cash flow models due to the different features of the class such as fixed rate, floating rate, or a combination of both. Indetermining the amount of &#147;currently performing&#148; collateral for purposes of the table above, the total amount of issuers&#146;balances outstanding have been reduced by the amount in deferral and default. Also, for some of the securities, management hasfurther reduced the total performing balance for the effects of issuers&#146; subsequent announcements of their intent to deferon the next applicable payment, and for other relevant circumstances through the date of issuance of the financial statements.Management considered all such announcements and circumstances known to us in evaluating the pooled trust preferred securitiesfor OTTI as of December 31, 2011. </font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.7pt 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><font style="font-weight: normal">&#160;</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.7pt 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><font style="font-weight: normal">Inthe table above, &#147;Excess Subordination Defaults as % of Performing Collateral&#148; (Excess Subordination Ratio) was calculatedas follows: total face value of performing collateral minus face value of all outstanding note balances not subordinate to ourinvestment, divided by total face value of performing collateral. The Excess Subordination Ratio measures the extent to whichthere may be tranches within each pooled trust preferred structure available to absorb credit losses before the Company&#146;ssecurities would be adversely impacted. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the amount of deferrals and defaults on the pools described aboverose significantly, which has resulted in substantial reductions in the amounts of performing collateral. As a result, the negativeExcess Subordination Ratio percentages shown in the table signify there is no support from subordinate tranches available to absorblosses before the Company&#146;s securities would be adversely impacted. A negative Subordination Ratio is not definitive, inisolation, for determining whether or not OTTI should be recorded for a pooled trust preferred security. Other factors affectthe timing and amount of cash flows available for payments to the note holders (investors); including the excess interest paidby the issuers (the issuers typically pay higher rates of interest than are paid out to the note holders).</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.7pt 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white">&#160;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><font style="font-weight: normal">TheCompany uses the OTTI evaluation model to compare the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimates to ensurethere are no adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter.

TheCompany uses market-based yield indicators as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates, and then adjusts the resultingdiscount rates on the basis of its credit and structural analysis of specific trust preferred securities. The Company looks principallyto market yields to maturity for investment grade and non investment grade trust preferred securities for which there is an activeand liquid market. The next step is to make a series of adjustments to reflect the differences that nevertheless exist betweenthese products (both credit and structural) and, most importantly, to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences (bothactual and projected) between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific trust preferred securities. In addition,utilization of the individual trust preferred investment&#146;s interest crediting rate and if applicable, margin index, is utilizedin calculating the expected cash flows. </font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><font style="font-weight: normal">Prepaymentscan occur at the discretion of the issuer on predetermined call increments. The call provision allows the issuer to prepay someor the entire outstanding debt obligation on the fifth year and every fifth year thereafter. Due to the general weakness of thefinancial sector and the regulatory requirements to maintain and increase the capitalization of U.S. banks, the Company concludedthat the issuers were unlikely to prepay their outstanding debt obligation and thereby reducing their individual capital ratiosduring this continued difficult economic cycle.</font></p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 100%; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0.1in"><tr style="vertical-align: top"><td style="width: 0"></td><td style="width: 0.35in"></td></tr></table><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white"><font style="font-weight: normal">TheCompany reviews each issuer individually for projected future deferrals and defaults. The purpose of the individual issuer reviewis to determine if an individual issuer demonstrates a significant likelihood of potential deferral/default so as to require afurther addition to the projected additional default percentages as outlined in the above table. This review includes obtainingquarterly financial information and monitoring news releases and pertinent information relative to those issuers. The Company specificallyreviews certain financial ratios including Fitch Score and &#147;Texas Ratio&#148; as well as capital adequacy and participationin the Troubled Asset Relief Program of each issuer. The Company believes the &#147;Texas Ratio (&#147;TR&#148;)&#148; is aprominent indicator of the stress a financial institution is experiencing. The TR is calculated by dividing nonperforming assetsand loans, including past due 90 days or more, by the sum of tangible equity and loan loss reserves. Management judgmentally establishesvarious credit criteria, and combinations of credit criteria and those issuers meeting some combination of such criteria are consideredadditional deferrals as of the reporting date. Based on the results of this analysis, the Company ensures that actual deferrals/defaultsas well as forecasted deferrals/defaults of specific institutions are appropriately factored into the cash flow projections foreach security. The default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral were formed based on the evaluation of collateralcredit and a review of historical default data and current/near term operating conditions. There is no recovery estimated for actualdefaulted issuers. Projected deferrals are modeled in a consistent manner with actual deferrals. One of these securities was fullyimpaired in 2009. Our model indicated additional other-than-temporary impairment on three of these securities, which resulted frommanagement projecting additional defaults or deferrals during the period.</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify; background-color: white">OTTIlosses totaled $292,000 during 2011 which was recorded as expense. The other five trust preferred securities had no further other-than-temporaryimpairment in 2011. These eight securities remain classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2011. It is possible that theunderlying collateral of these securities will perform worse than expectations including an increase in deferrals/defaults aboveprojections, which may lead to adverse changes in cash flows on these securities and potential future OTTI losses. Events thatmay trigger material declines in fair value for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deteriorationof credit metrics, such as significantly higher levels of defaults, and severity of loss on the underlying collateral and furtherilliquidity.&#9;<b>&#9;</b></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

Management has identified that the Company has four reporting units, its banking unit, its insurance unit, itsemployee benefits consulting unit and its risk management activities unit. There is no goodwill attributable to the risk managementactivities unit. Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of each reporting unit, including the existing goodwilland intangible assets, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units exceedstheir fair value, we are required to perform a second step to the impairment test.</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.1in; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td style="text-align: justify; width: 0.35in"></td></tr></table><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">Our annualimpairment analysis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 indicated that a step 2 analysis was not necessary.

Other financial instruments primarily include rights and warrants.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">The weighted average expectedlong-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends in the System&#146;s assets as well as projected future rates ofreturn on those assets and reasonable actuarial assumptions based on the guidance provided by ASOP No. 27 &#148;Selection ofEconomic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations&#148; for long term inflation, and the real and nominal rate of investmentreturn for a specific mix of asset classes.

The System currently prohibits its investment managers from purchasing any security greaterthan 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase or greater than 8% at market value in any one issuer. In addition the followingare prohibited: (1) Equity security short sales, unregistered securities and margin purchases; (2) fixed income securities thatare of Baa2/BBB quality or less, mortgage backed derivatives that have an inverse floating rate coupon or that are interest onlysecurities, any asset backed security that is not issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies or its instrumentalities and securitiesof less than A-quality may not in the aggregate exceed 10% of the investment manager&#146;s portfolio; and (3) other financialinstruments such as unhedged currency exposure in countries not defined as &#147;high income economies&#148; by the World Bank.Prior to September 2011, investments in emerging countries as defined by Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Index and structured noteswere prohibited. All other investments not prohibited by the System are permitted. At December 31, 2011, the System holds certaininvestments which are no longer deemed acceptable to acquire. These positions will be liquidated when the investment managers deemthat such liquidation is in the best interest of the System.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in;

Employees are eligible for the Plan if they are twenty-one years of age and have one year of servicewith at least 1,000 hours. The ESOP purchased 157,500 shares of common stock as part of the second step conversion (see Footnote22) which was funded by a loan from the Company payable in ten equal installments over 10 years bearing a variable interest rateof prime at the beginning of the year which was 3.25% for 2011 and 2010. Loan payments are to be funded by cash contributions fromthe Bank. The loan can be prepaid without penalty. Shares purchased by the ESOP are maintained in a suspense account and held forallocation among the participants. As loan payments are made, shares are committed to be released and subsequently allocated toemployee accounts at each calendar year end. Compensation expense is recognized related to the shares committed to be releasedbased on the average market price during the period. Cash dividends received on unallocated shares are used to pay debt service.For the purpose of computing earnings per share, unallocated ESOP shares are not considered outstanding. Contributions to the ESOPduring 2011 and 2010 were $288,538 and $331,100 respectively. Expense recorded for 2011 and 2010 was $343,042 and $302,739 respectively.In 2009, the Company made a discretionary contribution to the plan and recorded compensation expense of $300,000 for the plan topurchase additional shares to allocate to participants.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif;

The plan also hasa reload feature which entitles the option holder, who has delivered common stock as payment of the exercise price for optionstock, to a new option to acquire additional shares in the amount equal to the shares traded in. The option period during whichthe reload option may be exercised expires at the same time as that of the original option that the holder has exercised.

The expected term of options granted isbased on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes intoaccount that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on theU.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.

The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.75%and maturities ranging from 15 years to 30 years. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long asthere is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or othertermination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawnupon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer'screditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension ofcredit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but includes residential and commercialreal estate.</p>

Prior to the completion of the Conversion, the MHC owned approximately 55.0% of the common stock ofthe Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">In connection with the Conversion,the outstanding shares of Oneida Financial Corp owned by the MHC were sold to the depositors of Oneida Savings Bank and otherpublic investors. Completion of the Conversion and Offering resulted in the issuance of 7,164,794 shares of common stock. A totalof 3,937,500 shares were sold in the subscription, community and syndicated offerings, at $8.00 per share. An additional 3,227,294shares were issued to the former public stockholders of the Company based upon an exchange ratio of 0.9136 new shares for eachshare of Oneida Financial Corp common stock held at the close of business on July 7, 2010. Common shares held by the Company&#146;sESOP and Recognition and Retention Plan prior the conversion were also exchanged using the conversion ratio of 0.9136. The Conversionwas accounted for as a change in corporate form with no resulting change in the historical basis of the Company&#146;s assets,liabilities and equity. Costs related to the Offering, primarily marketing fees paid to the Company&#146;s investment bankingfirm, professional fees, registration fees, printing and mailing costs were $2.5 million and accordingly, net proceeds were $27.7million. In addition, as part of the conversion and dissolution of the MHC, the Company received $36,000 of cash previously heldby the MHC. As a result of the Conversion and offering, Oneida Financial Corp. was succeeded by a new, fully public, Marylandcorporation with the same name and the MHC ceased to exist</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.1in; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif"><tr style="vertical-align: top">    <td style="text-align: justify; width: 0.35in"></td></tr></table><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">Also pursuant to the plan ofconversion, a liquidation account was created by the Holding Company for the benefit of Eligible Account Holders and SupplementalEligible Account Holders (as those terms are defined in the plan of conversion) in an amount equal to (i) the MHC&#146;s ownershipinterest in the Company&#146;s total stockholders&#146; equity as of the date of the latest statement of financial condition usedin the prospectus plus (ii) the value of the net assets of the MHC as of the date of the latest statement of financial conditionof the MHC used in the prospectus. The plan of conversion also provides the establishment of a bank liquidation account at theBank to support the Holding Company&#146;s liquidation account. The liquidation account is designed to provide payments to depositorsof their liquidation interests in the event of a liquidation of the Holding Company and the Bank or a liquidation solely of theBank. Specifically, in the unlikely event that either the Bank or the Holding Company and the Bank were to liquidate after theconversion, all claims of creditors, including those of depositors, would be paid first, followed by distribution to eligibledepositors of their interests in the liquidation account maintained by the Holding Company.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify"><b>&#160;</b></p>

Payments on these loans depend to a large degree on the results of operationsand management of the properties or underlying businesses, and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in thereal estate market or the economy in general.

Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateralbased, with loan amounts based on predetermined loan to collateral values and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateralis viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans may be collateralizedby equipment or other business assets, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficientsource of repayment because equipment and other business assets may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. Accordingly,the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), whileliquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. </font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify"><font style="font-weight: normal">Consumerloans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than one-to-four family mortgage loans.

The remaining deficiencyoften does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition,consumer loan collections depend on the borrower&#146;s personal financial stability.

Home equity loans may be underwritten with a loan to value ratio of 90% when combined with the principalbalance of an existing mortgage loan. Home equity loans generally involve greater credit risk than the primary residential mortgageloans due to the potential of declines in collateral values, collectability as a result of foreclosure processes if the Bank isconsidered to be in a secondary position as well as the amount of expenses incurred during the process.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">Residential real estate loanshave as collateral a borrower&#146;s primary residence.

Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available oralternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. Allclasses of servicing assets are subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to beamortized into non-interest income in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated future net servicing income of theunderlying loans. The valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future netservicing income, such as the cost to service, the discount rate, the custodial earnings rate, an inflation rate, ancillaryincome, prepayment speeds and default rates and losses. The Company compares the valuation model inputs and results topublished industry data in order to validate the model results and assumptions. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairmentbased upon the fair value of the rights as compared to carrying amounts. Impairment is determined by stratifying rights intogroupings based on predominant risk characteristics, such as interest rate, loan type and investor type. Impairment isrecognized through a valuation allowance for an individual grouping, to the extent that fair value is less than the carryingamount. If the Company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular grouping, areduction of the allowance may be recorded as an increase in income. The fair values of servicing rights are subject tosignificant fluctuations as a result of changes in estimated and actual prepayment speeds and default rates and losses.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">Servicing fee income which isreported on the income statement as other non-interest income is recorded for fees earned for servicing loans.

This guidance requires that if the carryingamount of a reporting unit is zero or negative, a qualitative assessment be performed to determine if it is more likely than notthat goodwill is impaired. Step 2 of the impairment test shall be performed if it is determined that it is more likely than notthat goodwill is impaired. The amendments in this guidance were effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,beginning after December 15, 2010. The effect of adopting this standard did not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s operatingresults or financial condition.</font></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">In April 2011, the FASB amendedexisting guidance for assisting a creditor in determining whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring. The amendmentsclarify the guidance for a creditor&#146;s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencingfinancial difficulties. With regard to determining whether a concession has been granted, the ASU clarifies that creditors areprecluded from using the effective interest method to determine whether a concession has been granted. In absence of using theeffective interest method, a creditor must now focus on other considerations such as the value of the underlying collateral, evaluationof other collateral or guarantees, the debtor&#146;s ability to access other funds at market rates, interest rate increases andwhether the restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. This guidance was effective for interim and annualreporting periods beginning after June 15, 2011, and was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period ofadoption. For purpose of measuring impairment on newly identified troubled debt restructuring, the amendments were applied prospectivelyfor the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance did not have a materialeffect on the Company&#146;s operating results or financial condition.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">In May 2011, the FASB issuedan amendment to achieve common fair value measurements and disclosure requirements between U.S. and International accounting principles.Overall, the guidance is consistent with existing U.S accounting principles; however, there are some amendments that change a particularprinciple or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The amendments inthis guidance are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.

The amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuousstatement or in two separate consecutive statements. The amendments in this guidance are effective as of the beginning of a fiscalreporting year and interim periods within that year that begins after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this amendment will changethe presentation of the components of comprehensive income for the Company as part of the consolidated statement of stockholders&#146;equity.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">In September 2011, the FASBamended existing guidance related to goodwill impairment testing. The amendment permits an assessment of qualitative factors todetermine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fairvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing these events and circumstances, it is concludedthat it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount, then performingthe two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The amendments in this guidance are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairmenttests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interimgoodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011 if financial statements for the most recent annualor interim period have not been issued. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company&#146;soperating results or financial condition.</p>

margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">The Company categorizes loansinto risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financialinformation, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among otherfactors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogenousloans, such as commercial and commercial real estate with an outstanding relationship greater than $250,000. Homogenous loans arereviewed when appropriate given foreclosures, bankruptcies or relationships that include non-homogenous loans. For homogenous loanpools, such as residential mortgages, home equity and consumer loans, the Company uses the payment status to identify the creditrisk in these loan portfolios. Payment status is reviewed on at least a monthly basis by the Company&#146;s personnel and on aquarterly basis with respect to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis is performed on at leastan annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.5in; text-align: justify"><b>Special Mention.</b> Loansclassified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management&#146;s close attention. If left uncovered, thesepotential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution&#146;s credit positionat some future date.<b>&#9;</b></p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.5in; text-align: justify"><b>Substandard.</b> Loans classifiedas substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged,if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debts. They are characterizedby the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.5in; text-align: justify"><b>Doubtful.</b> Loans classifiedas doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknessesmake collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable andimprobable.&#9;</p><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in; text-align: justify">Loans not meeting the criteriaabove that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listedas not rated are either less than $250,000 or are included in groups of homogenous loans. Based on the most recent analysis performed(all loans graded within the past 12 months), the risk category by class of loans is as follows:</p><p style="color: Red; font: 9pt Arial; margin: 0 0 0.1in 0.35in;

  As of December 31, 2011, the Companys security portfolio consisted of 354 securities, 36 of which were in an unrealized loss position. The majority of the unrealized losses are related to the Companys agency, non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate and trust preferred securities as discussed below.
  U.S. Agency and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities
  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the Small Business Administration guarantee the contractual cash flows of our agency and mortgage-backed securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Our Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.
  At December 31, 2011, of the six U.S. Government sponsored enterprise agency and mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position in our available-for-sale portfolio, only one was in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality. The Company does not have the intent to sell these agency and mortgage-backed securities and it is likely that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
  Non-Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations
  All of our non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations carry various amounts of credit enhancement. These securities were purchased based on the underlying loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio, credit scores, property type, location and the level of credit enhancement. Current characteristics of each security are reviewed regularly by management. If the level of credit loss coverage is sufficient; it indicates that we will receive all of the originally scheduled cash flows. 
  At December 31, 2011, the one non-agency collateralized mortgage obligation in an unrealized loss position was in a continuous unrealized loss position more than 12 months. It was rated Aaa or better at time of purchase. Including the security just disclosed, the Bank currently has two obligations totaling $1.4 million that based on the expected cash flows, delinquencies and credit support the Company has considered impaired and are currently below investment grade. The total impairment recorded during 2011 was $75,334. No impairment was recorded for 2010. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 on these two securities were $89,070 and $144,000 respectively. These securities remain available for sale at December 31, 2011.
  Corporate Debt Securities
  At December 31, 2011, of the 20 corporate debt securities in an unrealized loss position, five were in a continuous unrealized loss position of 12 months or more. We have assessed these securities and determined that the decline in fair value was temporary. In making this determination, we considered the period of time the securities were in a loss position, the percentage decline in comparison with the securities amortized cost, the financial condition of the issuer, and the delinquency or default rates based on the applicable bond ratings. In addition, we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before their anticipated recovery of their cost basis, which may be at maturity. Included in the five securities whose unrealized loss position exceeds 12 months was a $2.5 million Strats-
Goldman Sachs Corporation obligation, maturing February 15, 2034 which is a variable rate note based on the 6 month LIBOR. The current rate on the security is 1.77%. The unrealized loss was $1,190,000 and $914,000 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 respectively. In addition to the items noted above, we reviewed capital ratios, public filings of the issuer and related trust documents in the review of the unrealized loss. Strats-Goldman Sachs Corporation is paying as agreed. The other four securities in a continuous unrealized loss position were finance sector corporate debt securities all rated above investment grade with variable interest rates that have maturities ranging from 2015 to 2020. The Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.
  Trust Preferred Securities
  The Company currently has $3.6 million invested in nine trust preferred securities as of December 31, 2011 whose unrealized losses have been in a continuous loss position exceeding 12 months or more. All of the trust preferred securities are pooled issuances. Of the $3.6 million, $976,000 has variable rates of interest. $3.6 million of the investments are on nonaccrual as of December 31, 2011. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 on the nine securities totaled $2.7 million and $3.5 million respectively.

        (1) The table     above presents ratings information as of December 31, 2011.  The securities had "investment grade"
                ratings by Moody's (Baa2 or better) at the time of purchase, but have since been downgraded by the ratings agencies
      (2) Book value     has been reduced by realized losses to reflect a new amortized cost basis
      (3) Represents     life to date cumulative loss recognized in the income statement
 
    
  The structuring of trust preferred securities generally provide for a waterfall approach to absorbing losses whereby lower tranches are initially impacted and more senior tranches are impacted after lower tranches can no longer absorb losses. Likewise, the waterfall approach also applies to principal and interest payments received, as senior tranches have priority over lower tranches in the receipt of payments. In addition, there may be multiple classes within a single tranche that react differently to assumptions utilized in cash flow models due to the different features of the class such as fixed rate, floating rate, or a combination of both. In determining the amount of currently performing collateral for purposes of the table above, the total amount of issuers balances outstanding have been reduced by the amount in deferral and default. Also, for some of the securities, management has further reduced the total performing balance for the effects of issuers subsequent announcements of their intent to defer on the next applicable payment, and for other relevant circumstances through the date of issuance of the financial statements. Management considered all such announcements and circumstances known to us in evaluating the pooled trust preferred securities for OTTI as of December 31, 2011. 
   
  In the table above, Excess Subordination Defaults as % of Performing Collateral (Excess Subordination Ratio) was calculated as follows: total face value of performing collateral minus face value of all outstanding note balances not subordinate to our investment, divided by total face value of performing collateral. The Excess Subordination Ratio measures the extent to which there may be tranches within each pooled trust preferred structure available to absorb credit losses before the Companys securities would be adversely impacted. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the amount of deferrals and defaults on the pools described above rose significantly, which has resulted in substantial reductions in the amounts of performing collateral. As a result, the negative Excess Subordination Ratio percentages shown in the table signify there is no support from subordinate tranches available to absorb losses before the Companys securities would be adversely impacted. A negative Subordination Ratio is not definitive, in isolation, for determining whether or not OTTI should be recorded for a pooled trust preferred security. Other factors affect the timing and amount of cash flows available for payments to the note holders (investors); including the excess interest paid by the issuers (the issuers typically pay higher rates of interest than are paid out to the note holders).
   
  The Company uses the OTTI evaluation model to compare the present value of expected cash flows to the previous estimates to ensure there are no adverse changes in cash flows during the quarter. The OTTI model considers the structure and term of the trust preferred securities and the financial condition of the underlying issuers, the timing and amount of interest and principal payments of the underlying issuers, and the allocation of the payments to the note classes. The current estimate of expected cash flows is based on the most recent trustee reports and any other relevant market information including announcements of interest payment deferrals or defaults of underlying trust preferred securities. Assumptions used in the models are as follows: 
  
         
     Significant     inputs at December 31, 2011
       
      
      Annual     prepayment
     1%     annually
      Projected     severity of loss on current defaults
     100%
      Projected     severity of loss on current deferrals
     0%     - 80%
      Projected     severity of loss on specific deferrals
     0%     - 80%
      Projected     additional defaults:
     0.375%     applied annually
      Projected     severity of loss on additional defaults
     60     - 75%
      Present     value discount rates for OTTI
     3.66%     - 9.91%
      Present     value discount rates for fair value
     15%
 
    
  The discount rates range can vary depending on the index the instruments are tied to as well as the spread for each instrument. The Company uses market-based yield indicators as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates, and then adjusts the resulting discount rates on the basis of its credit and structural analysis of specific trust preferred securities. The Company looks principally to market yields to maturity for investment grade and non investment grade trust preferred securities for which there is an active and liquid market. The next step is to make a series of adjustments to reflect the differences that nevertheless exist between these products (both credit and structural) and, most importantly, to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences (both actual and projected) between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific trust preferred securities. In addition, utilization of the individual trust preferred investments interest crediting rate and if applicable, margin index, is utilized in calculating the expected cash flows. 
  Prepayments can occur at the discretion of the issuer on predetermined call increments. The call provision allows the issuer to prepay some or the entire outstanding debt obligation on the fifth year and every fifth year thereafter. Due to the general weakness of the financial sector and the regulatory requirements to maintain and increase the capitalization of U.S. banks, the Company concluded that the issuers were unlikely to prepay their outstanding debt obligation and thereby reducing their individual capital ratios during this continued difficult economic cycle.
   
  The Company reviews each issuer individually for projected future deferrals and defaults. The purpose of the individual issuer review is to determine if an individual issuer demonstrates a significant likelihood of potential deferral/default so as to require a further addition to the projected additional default percentages as outlined in the above table. This review includes obtaining quarterly financial information and monitoring news releases and pertinent information relative to those issuers. The Company specifically reviews certain financial ratios including Fitch Score and Texas Ratio as well as capital adequacy and participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program of each issuer. The Company believes the Texas Ratio (TR) is a prominent indicator of the stress a financial institution is experiencing. The TR is calculated by dividing nonperforming assets and loans, including past due 90 days or more, by the sum of tangible equity and loan loss reserves. Management judgmentally establishes various credit criteria, and combinations of credit criteria and those issuers meeting some combination of such criteria are considered additional deferrals as of the reporting date. Based on the results of this analysis, the Company ensures that actual deferrals/defaults as well as forecasted deferrals/defaults of specific institutions are appropriately factored into the cash flow projections for each security. The default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral were formed based on the evaluation of collateral credit and a review of historical default data and current/near term operating conditions. There is no recovery estimated for actual defaulted issuers. Projected deferrals are modeled in a consistent manner with actual deferrals. One of these securities was fully impaired in 2009. Our model indicated additional other-than-temporary impairment on three of these securities, which resulted from management projecting additional defaults or deferrals during the period.
  OTTI losses totaled $292,000 during 2011 which was recorded as expense. The other five trust preferred securities had no further other-than-temporary impairment in 2011. These eight securities remain classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 2011. It is possible that the underlying collateral of these securities will perform worse than expectations including an increase in deferrals/defaults above projections, which may lead to adverse changes in cash flows on these securities and potential future OTTI losses. Events that may trigger material declines in fair value for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, such as significantly higher levels of defaults, and severity of loss on the underlying collateral and further illiquidity.

  Unrealized losses on other investments have not been recognized into income because the issuer(s) securities are of investment grade (except as indicated above), management does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that management would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates. The fair value is expected to recover as the bond(s) approach maturity.

                 Tabular disclosure of investments in certain debt and equity securities (and certain other trading assets) which include all debt and equity securities (other than those equity securities accounted for under the equity or cost methods of accounting) with readily determinable fair values. Other trading assets include assets that are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and held for trading purposes.  A debt security represents a creditor relationship with an enterprise that is in the form of a security. Debt securities include, among other items, US Treasury securities, US government securities, municipal securities, corporate bonds, convertible debt, commercial paper, and all securitized debt instruments. An equity security represents an ownership interest in an enterprise or the right to acquire or dispose of an ownership interest in an enterprise at fixed or determinable prices. Equity securities include, among other things, common stock, certain preferred stock, warrant rights, call options, and put options, but do not include convertible debt. An entity may opt to provide the reader with additional narrative text to better understand the nature of investments in debt and equity securities (and other trading assets).

                 The sum of cash and cash equivalents plus Federal Funds Sold. Cash and cash equivalents consist of short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present negligible risk of changes in value due to changes in interest rates -- usually with an original maturity less than 90 days.

         15.
     Dividends and Restrictions
 
   The Companys principal source of funds for dividend payments is dividends received from the Bank. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the New York State Banking. In addition to state law requirements and the capital requirements discussed below, the circumstances under which the Bank may pay dividends are limited by federal statutes, regulations, and policies. Retained earnings of the Bank are subject to certain restrictions under New York State Banking regulations. The amount of retained earnings legally available for dividends under these regulations was $9,915,343 and $6,162,202 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively.
  In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are authorized to determine under certain circumstances that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment of such dividends. The payment of dividends that deplete a banks capital base could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that banking organizations could generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.

                 The sum of the periodic adjustments of the differences between securities' face values and purchase prices that are charged against earnings. This is called accretion if the security was purchased at a discount and amortization if it was purchased at premium. As a noncash item, this element is an adjustment to net income when calculating cash provided by or used in operations using the indirect method.

                 Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

  Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the ability to carry back deductions to prior periods when the deferred tax assets are realized and/or in generating sufficient taxable income in future periods. Based on the Companys history of taxable income and expected future taxable income, the Company has determined that a valuation allowance is not required.
  At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within the next twelve months.
  The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, there were no amounts accrued for interest and penalties.
  The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as New York state income tax. The Company is no longer subject to federal or state examinations for tax years prior to 2008. The tax years of 2008-2010 remain open to federal and state examination.
  During 2011, the Internal Revenue Service completed an examination of the 2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns. The examination had no material impact on the financial statements. Additionally, during 2011, the State of New York completed an examination of the 2008 New York income tax return. The examination had no material impact on the financial statements.

     Benefit Plans
 
   The Bank provides a noncontributory defined benefit retirement accumulation plan (cash balance plan) covering substantially all employees. Under the plan, retirement benefits are primarily a function of the employee's years of service and level of compensation. As of June 15, 2004, the Bank had a plan amendment to freeze the plan benefits for plan participants. The Bank uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension plan. State Bank of Chittenango, a limited purpose commercial bank subsidiary of Oneida Savings Bank, participated in the New York State Bankers Retirement System (the System) plan which was a noncontributory defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees. Under the plan, retirement benefits were primarily a function of the employees years of service and level of compensation. The plan was frozen as of May 31, 2002. State Bank of Chittenango uses a December 31 measurement date for its pension plan.

  Oneida Savings Bank Plan Assets
  The Companys overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 65% of investments for long-term growth and 35% for near-term benefit payments to preserve the long-term earnings power of the assets. The target allocations for plan assets are shown in the table below. Equity securities primarily include investments in common stock. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds, government issues and mortgage-backed securities. Other fixed income securities include a money market account and checking account.
  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends in the plan assets as well as projected future rates of return on those assets. The following assumptions were used in determining the long-term rate of return:
         
     Equity securities
     Dividend discount model, the smoothed     earnings yield model and the equity risk premium model
 
   
  
        
 
          
     Fixed income securities
     	Current yield to maturity and forecasts     of future yields
 
   The long term rate of return considers historical returns. There were no adjustments made to historical returns.
  The plan is prohibited from investing in the following investments or transactions: (1) commodities and futures; (2) warrants; (3) Eurobonds; (4) naked option transactions; (5) margin purchase securities; (6) private placements; (7) short sales of securities; (8) unregistered or restricted stock and (9) speculative derivatives. All assets selected for inclusion in the Portfolio must have a readily ascertainable market value and must be generally considered marketable at the time of purchase.
  The Companys pension plan asset allocation at year-end 2011 and 2010, target allocation for 2012, and expected long-term rate of return by asset category are as follows:

  There were no plan assets measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for period ending December 31, 2011 and 2010.
  State Bank of Chittenango Plan Assets
  The Companys overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 97% of investments for long-term growth and 3% for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and fund managers. The target allocations for System assets are shown in the table below. Cash equivalents consist primarily of short term investment funds. Equity securities primarily include investments in common stock and depository receipts. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds, government issues and mortgage-backed securities. Other financial instruments primarily include rights and warrants.
  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return is estimated based on current trends in the Systems assets as well as projected future rates of return on those assets and reasonable actuarial assumptions based on the guidance provided by ASOP No. 27 Selection of Economic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations for long term inflation, and the real and nominal rate of investment return for a specific mix of asset classes. The following assumptions were used in determining the long-term rate of return:
         
     Equity     securities
     Dividend     discount model, the smoothed earnings yield model and the equity risk premium model
       
     Fixed     income securities
     Current     yield to maturity and forecasts of future yields
       
      
      
       
     Other     financial instruments
     Comparison     of the specific investments risk to that of fixed income and equity instruments and using judgment
 
   
        
 
   The long term rate of return considers historical returns. Adjustments were made to historical returns in order to reflect expectations of future returns. These adjustments were due to factor forecasts by economists and long-term U.S. Treasury yields to forecast long-term inflation. In addition, forecasts by economists and others for long-term GDP growth were factored into the development of assumptions for earnings growth and per capita income.
  Effective September 2011, the System revised its investment guidelines. The System currently prohibits its investment managers from purchasing any security greater than 5% of the portfolio at the time of purchase or greater than 8% at market value in any one issuer. In addition the following are prohibited: (1) Equity security short sales, unregistered securities and margin purchases; (2) fixed income securities that are of Baa2/BBB quality or less, mortgage backed derivatives that have an inverse floating rate coupon or that are interest only securities, any asset backed security that is not issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies or its instrumentalities and securities of less than A-quality may not in the aggregate exceed 10% of the investment managers portfolio; and (3) other financial instruments such as unhedged currency exposure in countries not defined as high income economies by the World Bank. Prior to September 2011, investments in emerging countries as defined by Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Index and structured notes were prohibited. All other investments not prohibited by the System are permitted. At December 31, 2011, the System holds certain investments which are no longer deemed acceptable to acquire. These positions will be liquidated when the investment managers deem that such liquidation is in the best interest of the System.
  The Companys pension plan asset allocation at year-end 2011 and 2010, target allocation for 2012 and expected long-term rate of return by asset category are as follows:

  In addition to the retirement plan, the Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan which enables employees who meet the plan's eligibility requirements to defer income on a pre-tax basis.
        
 
   Employees may elect to contribute a portion of their compensation, with the Company matching the contribution up to 5% of compensation. Employer contributions associated with the plan amounted to $655,808, $622,681 and $570,401 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
  The Bank provides The Oneida Savings Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) with all employees meeting the age and service requirements eligible to participate in the Plan. Employees are eligible for the Plan if they are twenty-one years of age and have one year of service with at least 1,000 hours. The ESOP purchased 157,500 shares of common stock as part of the second step conversion (see Footnote 22) which was funded by a loan from the Company payable in ten equal installments over 10 years bearing a variable interest rate of prime at the beginning of the year which was 3.25% for 2011 and 2010. Loan payments are to be funded by cash contributions from the Bank. The loan can be prepaid without penalty. Shares purchased by the ESOP are maintained in a suspense account and held for allocation among the participants. As loan payments are made, shares are committed to be released and subsequently allocated to employee accounts at each calendar year end. Compensation expense is recognized related to the shares committed to be released based on the average market price during the period. Cash dividends received on unallocated shares are used to pay debt service. For the purpose of computing earnings per share, unallocated ESOP shares are not considered outstanding. Contributions to the ESOP during 2011 and 2010 were $288,538 and $331,100 respectively. Expense recorded for 2011 and 2010 was $343,042 and $302,739 respectively. In 2009, the Company made a discretionary contribution to the plan and recorded compensation expense of $300,000 for the plan to purchase additional shares to allocate to participants.
  Shares held by the ESOP were as follows:

     Fair Value
 
   Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date.
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.
  The Company uses the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument.
  Securities
: The fair values of trading securities and investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market price of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Discounted cash flows are calculated using spread to swap and LIBOR curves that are updated to incorporate loss severities, volatility, credit spread and optionality. During times when trading is more liquid, broker quotes are used (if available) to validate the model. Rating agency and industry research as well as defaults and deferrals on individual securities are reviewed and incorporated into the calculations. 
  Trust Preferred Securities which are issued by financial institutions and insurance companies were historically priced using Level 2 inputs. The decline in the level of observable inputs and market activity in this class of investments by the measurement date has been significant and resulted in unreliable external pricing. Broker pricing and bid/ask spreads, when available, vary widely. The once active market has become comparatively inactive. As such, these investments are now priced using Level 3 inputs.
  The Company has developed an internal model for pricing these securities. Information such as historical and current performance of the underlying collateral, deferral/default rates, collateral coverage ratios, break in yield calculations, cash flow projections, liquidity and credit premiums required by a market participant, and financial trend analysis with respect to the individual issuing financial institutions and insurance companies, are utilized in determining individual security valuations. Due to current market conditions as well as the limited trading activity of these securities, the market value of the securities is highly sensitive to assumption changes and market volatility.
  Non-rated local municipal securities which are Bond Anticipation Notes or other bonds were historically priced using level 2 inputs. The market activity for these types of instruments is localized within our own market. We are considering these to be more level 3 pricing due to the lack of certain brokers providing quotes on this type of security. The Company does obtain broker quotes as available and reviews past history of the contractual payments and financial condition of the municipalities in determining an appropriate market value for this type of security.
        
 
   Common and preferred equity securities are generally priced using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs due to the market activity of these types of securities. One of the preferred securities is considered level 3 pricing due to the limited trading activity of the individual security in the market and lack of certain brokers providing quotes on this type of security. The Company does obtain available, if any broker quotes, reviews past history of contractual payments and financial condition of the corporation in determining an appropriate market value for this type of security. 			
  Impaired Loans:
 Impaired commercial real estate loans that are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans, had a principal balance of $836,000, with a valuation allowance of $661,000 at December 31, 2011 resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $563,000 for the year then ended. Impaired commercial real estate loans had a principal balance of $1.4 million with a valuation allowance of $98,000 as of December 31, 2010. Estimates of fair value used for other collateral supporting commercial loans generally is not observable in the marketplace and therefore, such valuations have been classified as Level 3. Impaired commercial loans had a principal balance of $2.0 million with a valuation allowance of $2.0 million as of December 31, 2010 resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $1.6 million for the year then ended. This loan was charged off in April 2011. There were no impaired commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2011.
  Loan Servicing Rights:
 Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.
  Loans Held for Sale:
 Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments, from third party investors.

  The methods and assumptions, not previously presented, used to estimate fair value are described as follows:
  Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits, accrued interest receivable and payable, demand deposits, short-term debt, and variable rate loans or deposits that reprice frequently and fully. The method for determining the fair values for securities were described previously. For fixed rate loans or deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life and credit risk. Fair value of debt is based on current rates for similar financing. It is not practicable to determine the fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. The fair value of off-balance-sheet items is not considered material.

     Regulatory Matters
 
   The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2011, the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
  Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as is asset growth and expansion, and capital restoration plans are required. At year-end 2011 and 2010, the most recent regulatory notifications categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institutions category.
        
 
   The Bank's actual capital amounts and ratios are as follows:

  The Qualified Thrift Lender test requires at least 65% of assets be maintained in housing-related finance and other specified areas. If this test is not met, limits are placed on growth, branching, new investments, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and new dividends. Management believes this test is met.

                Stock Based Compensation Plans
         12.
     Stock Based Compensation Plans
 
   The Company had two share based compensation plans as described below. Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for those plans was $185,598 and $258,830 for 2010, and 2009. The total income tax benefit was $71,455 and $99,649. Both plans were final in 2010; therefore there was no activity or expense associated with them for 2011.
  Stock Option Plan
  The Companys 2000 Stock Option Plan, which was shareholder approved, permitted the granting of share options to its directors, officer and key employees for up to 342,205 share of common stock. The exercise price of options granted was equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant; those options vest and become exercisable ratably over a one to five-year period. The plan also has a reload feature which entitles the option holder, who has delivered common stock as payment of the exercise price for option stock, to a new option to acquire additional shares in the amount equal to the shares traded in. The option period during which the reload option may be exercised expires at the same time as that of the original option that the holder has exercised. The Company has a policy of using shares held as treasury stock to satisfy share option exercises. Compensation recorded in conjunction with these plans was $13,102 and $78,543 for 2010, and 2009, respectively. All options granted expired April 2010.
  The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a closed form option valuation (Black-Scholes) model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the Companys common stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected term of options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, which takes into account that the options are not transferable. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The fair value of options granted was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions as of grant date:

  Recognition Plan
  The Management Recognition and Retention Plan provides for the issuance of shares of restricted stock to directors, officers and key employees. Compensation expense equal to the market value of Oneida Financial Corp.s stock on the grant date is recognized ratably over the five year vesting period for shares of restricted stock granted that were fully vested at December 31, 2010. Compensation recorded in conjunction with these plans was $172,496 and $180,287 for 2010 and 2009 respectively. There were no shares available for future awards as of December 31, 2010. Shares unallocated under the plan available for future awards were 10,311 as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested shares granted under the Plan. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $124,658 and $146,780 respectively.

  During 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of Parsons, Cote & Company. Goodwill in the amount of $576,000 and intangible assets in the amount of $71,000 were recorded as part of the Parsons, Cote & Company acquisition. Under the terms of the agreement, contingent purchase payments based on future performance levels may be made over a three-year period ending December 31, 2008. Additional goodwill in the amount of $84,245 was recorded for the contingent purchase payment made in 2009.
  During 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC. Goodwill in the amount of $2.5 million and other intangible assets in the amount of $1.1 million were recorded as part of the acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, contingent purchase payments based on future performance levels may be made over a five-year period ending December 31, 2010. Additional goodwill in the amount of $95,388, $117,520 and $135,417 was recorded for the contingent purchase payment made in 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively based on performance through December 31, 2010. During 2011, $1.1 million of goodwill was transferred between the insurance activities and the benefit consulting activities which represented the movement of a segment of business that was transferred from Bailey and Haskell Associates, Inc. to Benefit Consulting Group LLC after the acquisition of Benefit Consulting Group LLC.
  During 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of David Holmes Agency, Inc., an insurance agency operating in Utica, New York. The Company paid $361,718 in cash and established a note payable for $361,718 to be paid monthly over 24 months with interest at 3.00% per annum for fixed assets and other intangible assets. Goodwill in the amount of $586,445 and intangible assets in the amount of $136,991 were recorded in conjunction with the acquisition. David Holmes Agency, Inc has been subsequently merged into Bailey and Haskell Associates, Inc. During 2011, the Company paid $163,099 in principal and $7,919 in interest payments on the note.
  Impairment exists when a reporting units carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test. Management has identified that the Company has four reporting units, its banking unit, its insurance unit, its employee benefits consulting unit and its risk management activities unit. There is no goodwill attributable to the risk management activities unit. Step 1 includes the determination of the carrying value of each reporting unit, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, and estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of the reporting units exceeds their fair value, we are required to perform a second step to the impairment test.
        
 
   Our annual impairment analysis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 indicated that a step 2 analysis was not necessary. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no impairment was recorded for goodwill.
  Other intangible assets consist of the following at December 31:

Commitments
  Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance-sheet risk to credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.
  The contractual amounts of financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk at year end were as follows:

  Commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of 60 days or less. The fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from 3.75% to 6.75% and maturities ranging from 15 years to 30 years. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon. Therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but includes residential and commercial real estate.

                 This element represents Other Comprehensive Income or Loss, Before Tax, for the period. The pretax revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income, but excluded from net income. Includes the entity's proportionate share of an investee's equity adjustments for other comprehensive income. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a credit balance consistent with its label.

  Credit Quality Indicators
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis includes non-homogenous loans, such as commercial and commercial real estate with an outstanding relationship greater than $250,000. Homogenous loans are reviewed when appropriate given foreclosures, bankruptcies or relationships that include non-homogenous loans. For homogenous loan pools, such as residential mortgages, home equity and consumer loans, the Company uses the payment status to identify the credit risk in these loan portfolios. Payment status is reviewed on at least a monthly basis by the Companys personnel and on a quarterly basis with respect to determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis is performed on at least an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
  Special Mention.
 Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves managements close attention. If left uncovered, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institutions credit position at some future date. 	
  Substandard.
 Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debts. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
  Doubtful.
 Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.	
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Loans listed as not rated are either less than $250,000 or are included in groups of homogenous loans. Based on the most recent analysis performed (all loans graded within the past 12 months), the risk category by class of loans is as follows:
