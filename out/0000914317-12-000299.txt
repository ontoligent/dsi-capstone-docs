Overview
 
Middlesex Water Company (Middlesex) was incorporated
as a water utility company in 1897 and owns and operates regulated water utility and wastewater systems in New Jersey, Delaware
and Pennsylvania. Middlesex also operates water and wastewater systems under contract on behalf of municipal and private clients
in New Jersey and Delaware.
 
The terms “the Company,” “we,”
“our,” and “us” refer to Middlesex Water Company and its subsidiaries, including Tidewater Utilities, Inc.
(Tidewater) and Tidewater’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Southern Shores Water Company, LLC (Southern Shores) and White Marsh
Environmental Systems, Inc. (White Marsh). The Company’s other subsidiaries are Pinelands Water Company (Pinelands Water)
and Pinelands Wastewater Company (Pinelands Wastewater) (collectively, Pinelands), Utility Service Affiliates, Inc. (USA), Utility
Service Affiliates (Perth Amboy) Inc., (USA-PA), Tidewater Environmental Services, Inc. (TESI) and Twin Lakes Utilities, Inc. (Twin
Lakes).
 
The Company’s principal executive offices
are located at 1500 Ronson Road, Iselin, New Jersey 08830. Our telephone number is (732) 634-1500. Our internet website address
is http://www.middlesexwater.com. We make available, free of charge through our internet website, reports and amendments filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after such material is electronically filed
with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).
 
Middlesex System 
 
The Middlesex System in New Jersey provides
water services to approximately 60,000 retail customers, primarily in eastern Middlesex County, New Jersey and provides water under
wholesale contracts to the City of Rahway, Townships of Edison and Marlboro, the Boroughs of Highland Park and Sayreville and the
Old Bridge Municipal Utilities Authority. The Middlesex System treats, stores and distributes water for residential, commercial,
industrial and fire prevention purposes. The Middlesex System also provides water treatment and pumping services to the Township
of East Brunswick under contract. The Middlesex System produced approximately 64% of our 2011 consolidated operating revenues.
 
The Middlesex System’s retail customers
are located in an area of approximately 55 square miles in Woodbridge Township, the City of South Amboy, the Boroughs of Metuchen
and Carteret, portions of the Township of Edison and the Borough of South Plainfield in Middlesex County and, to a minor extent,
a portion of the Township of Clark in Union County. Retail customers include a mix of residential customers, large industrial concerns
and commercial and light industrial facilities. These customers are located in generally well-developed areas of central New Jersey.
 
The contract customers of the Middlesex System
comprise an area of approximately 146 square miles with a population of approximately 303,000. Contract sales to Edison, Sayreville,
Old Bridge, Marlboro and Rahway are supplemental to the existing water systems of these customers. The Middlesex System provides
treated surface water under long-term agreements to East Brunswick, Marlboro, Old Bridge and Sayreville consistent with a plan
approved by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
 
Middlesex provides water service to approximately
300 customers in Cumberland County, New Jersey. This system is referred to as Bayview and is not physically interconnected with
the Middlesex System. Bayview produced less than 1% of our 2011 consolidated operating revenues.

Tidewater System 
 
Tidewater, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Southern Shores, provides water services to approximately 36,000 retail customers for domestic, commercial and fire protection
purposes in over 300 separate community water systems in New Castle, Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware. White Marsh is an additional
wholly-owned subsidiary that is unregulated as to rates and operates water and wastewater systems under contract for approximately
4,700 residential customers. White Marsh also owns the office buildings that Tidewater uses as its central business office campus.
The Tidewater System produced approximately 25% of our 2011 consolidated operating revenues.
 
Utility Service Affiliates-Perth Amboy 
 
USA-PA operates the City of Perth Amboy, New
Jersey’s water and wastewater systems under a 20-year agreement, which expires in 2018. USA-PA serves approximately 11,000
homes and businesses, most of which are served by both the water and wastewater systems. The agreement was effected under New Jersey’s
Water Supply Public-Private Contracting Act and the New Jersey Wastewater Public/Private Contracting Act. Under the agreement,
USA-PA receives fixed fees, and may receive variable fees, based on customer revenue growth. Fixed fee revenues increase over the
term of the 20-year contract based upon a schedule of rates. USA-PA produced approximately 9% of our 2011 consolidated operating
revenues.
 
In connection with the agreement with Perth
Amboy, USA-PA entered into a 20-year subcontract with a wastewater operating company for the operation and maintenance of the Perth
Amboy wastewater collection system. The subcontract provides for the sharing of certain fixed and variable fees and operating expenses.
 
Pinelands System 
 
Pinelands Water provides water services to
approximately 2,500 residential customers in Burlington County, New Jersey. Pinelands Water produced less than 1% of our 2011 consolidated

Pinelands Wastewater provides wastewater services
to approximately 2,400 residential customers. Under contract, it also services one municipal wastewater system in Burlington County,
New Jersey with approximately 200 residential customers. Pinelands Wastewater produced approximately 1% of our 2011 consolidated
operating revenues.
 
 
Utility Service Affiliates, Inc. 
 
USA offers residential customers in New Jersey
and Delaware water service line and sewer lateral maintenance programs (LineCare). In August 2011, USA entered into a 10-year marketing

Water Supplies and Contracts 
 
Our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania water
supply systems are physically separate and are not interconnected. In New Jersey, the Pinelands System and Bayview System are not
interconnected with the Middlesex System or each other. We believe that we have adequate sources of water supply to meet the current
service requirements of our present customers in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania.
 
Middlesex System 
 
Our Middlesex System, which produced approximately
15.6 billion gallons in 2011, obtains water from surface sources and wells, or groundwater sources. In 2011, surface sources of
water provided approximately 75% of the Middlesex System’s water supply, groundwater sources provided approximately 18% from
31 wells and the balance was purchased from a non-affiliated water utility. Middlesex System’s distribution storage facilities
are used to supply water to customers at times of peak demand, outages and emergencies.
 
The principal source of surface water for the
Middlesex System is the Delaware & Raritan Canal, which is owned by the State of New Jersey and operated as a water resource
by the New Jersey Water Supply Authority. Middlesex is under contract with the New Jersey Water Supply Authority, which expires
November 30, 2023. The contract provides for average purchases of 27 million gallons per day (mgd) of untreated water from the
Delaware & Raritan Canal, augmented by the Round Valley/Spruce Run Reservoir System. Surface water is pumped to, and treated
at the Middlesex Carl J. Olsen (CJO) Water Treatment Plant. Middlesex also has an agreement with a non-affiliated regulated water
utility for the purchase of treated water. This agreement provides for minimum purchase of 3.0 mgd of treated water with provisions
for additional purchases.

    Table of Contents
    
Tidewater System 
 
Our Tidewater System produced approximately
2.0 billion gallons in 2011 from 159 wells. In 2011, no new wells were placed into service and we retired 3 wells for the purpose
of consolidating production facilities for more cost-efficient operation. Tidewater expects to continue to submit applications
to Delaware regulatory authorities for the approval of additional wells as growth, demand and water quality warrant. The Tidewater
System does not have a central treatment facility but has several regional, as well as several smaller independent, treatment plants.
Several of its water systems in New Castle, Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware have interconnected transmission systems.  
 
Pinelands System 
 
Water supply to our Pinelands System is derived
from four wells which produced approximately 159.1 million gallons in 2011. The pumping capacity of the four wells is 2.2 million
gallons per day.
 
Pinelands Wastewater System 
 
The Pinelands Wastewater System discharges
into the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek through a tertiary treatment plant that provides clarification, sedimentation, filtration
and disinfection. The total capacity of the plant is 0.5 mgd, and the system treated approximately 113.2 million gallons in 2011.
 
Bayview System 
 
Water supply to Bayview customers is derived
from two wells, which delivered approximately 13.8 million gallons in 2011.
 
TESI System 
 
The TESI System is comprised of seven wastewater
treatment systems in Southern Delaware. The treatment plants provide clarification, sedimentation, and disinfection. The combined
total treatment capacity of the plants is 0.6 mgd. The TESI System treated approximately 76.8 million gallons in 2011.
 
Twin Lakes System
 
Water supply to Twin Lakes’ customers
is derived from two wells, which delivered approximately 26.6 million gallons in 2011.
 
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2011, we had a total of
289 employees. No employees are represented by a union. We believe our employee relations are good. Wages and benefits are reviewed
annually and are considered competitive within both the industry and the regions where we operate.
 
    5
    Table of Contents
    
Competition 
 
Our business in our franchised service area
is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. However, our ability
to provide contract water supply and wastewater services and operations and maintenance services is subject to competition from
other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. Although Tidewater has been granted an exclusive franchise for each
of its existing community water systems, its ability to expand service areas can be affected by the Delaware Public Service Commission
awarding franchises to other regulated water utilities with whom we compete for such franchises and for projects.
 
Regulation 
 
Our rates charged to customers for water and
wastewater services, the quality of the services we provide and certain other matters are regulated by the following state utility
commissions (collectively, the Utility Commissions):
· New Jersey-New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU)
· Delaware-Delaware Public Service Commission (DEPSC)
· Pennsylvania-Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission
(PAPUC)
 
Our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries
are not regulated public utilities. However they are subject to environmental regulation with respect to water and wastewater effluent
quality.
 
We are subject to environmental and water quality
regulation by the following regulatory agencies (collectively, the Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies):
· United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
· New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP)
with respect to operations in New Jersey
· Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control (DEDNREC), the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services-Division of Public Health (DEDPH), and the Delaware River
Basin Commission (DRBC) with respect to operations in Delaware
· Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP)
with respect to operations in Pennsylvania
 
In addition, our issuances of equity securities
are subject to the prior approval of the NJBPU and require registration with the SEC. Our issuances of long-term debt securities
are subject to the prior approval of the appropriate Utility Commissions.
 
Regulation of Rates and Services 
 
For ratemaking purposes, we account separately
for operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania to facilitate independent ratemaking by the applicable Utility Commissions.
 
In determining our rates, the respective Utility
Commissions consider the revenue, expenses, rate base of property used and useful in providing service to the public and a fair
rate of return on investments within their separate jurisdictions. Rate determinations by the respective Utility Commissions do
not guarantee particular rates of return to us for our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania operations. Thus, we may not achieve
the rates of return permitted by the Utility Commissions. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future rate increases
will be granted or, if granted, that they will be in the amounts requested.

Middlesex Rate Matters
  
In January 2012, Middlesex filed an application
with the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $11.3 million per year. The request was made as a
result of capital investments Middlesex has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations and maintenance costs.
We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request. A decision by the NJBPU
is not expected until the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
In August 2011, Middlesex implemented a NJBPU
approved Purchased Water Adjustment Clause (PWAC), which allows for the recovery of increased costs of $0.4 million to purchase
untreated water from the New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) and treated water from a non-affiliated regulated water utility.
It is expected that the PWAC rate will reset to zero as part of the ultimate decision rendered in the aforementioned Middlesex
base rate increase request.
 
In March 2010, the NJBPU granted
an increase in Middlesex’s annual operating revenues of 13.57%, or $7.8 million. The increase was  necessitated
by increased costs, as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of $180.3 million based on a return on
equity of 10.30%.
 
Tidewater Rate Matters
 
In September 2011, Tidewater filed an application
with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $6.9 million per year. The request was made as a
result of capital investments Tidewater has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations and maintenance costs.
We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request. A decision by the DEPSC
is not expected until the second half of 2012. In connection with the rate increase application, Tidewater implemented a DEPSC
approved 10.49% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on November 15, 2011.
 
A Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)
is a DEPSC approved rate-mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in non-revenue producing capital improvements
to the water system between base rate proceedings. The following summarizes Tidewater’s approved DSIC rates from January
1, 2011 through November 15, 2011, when Tidewater’s DSIC was set to 0.0% in connection with the aforementioned 10.49% interim
rate increase:
 
    Date
    January 1, 2011

    % Increase
    0.27%
    0.65%
    Cumulative %
    1.34%
    1.98%
 
In September 2009, the DEPSC approved an overall
14.95% or $3.0 million increase in Tidewater’s base rates. This rate increase approval is based on a 10.0% return on equity.
 
TESI Rate Matters
 
In July 2011, TESI filed an application with
the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $0.8 million per year. The request was made as a result
of capital investments TESI has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations and maintenance costs. We cannot
predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request. A decision by the DEPSC is not expected
until mid 2012. In connection with the rate increase application, TESI implemented a DEPSC approved 7.6% interim rate increase,
subject to refund, on September 28, 2011.

Southern Shores Rate Matters
 
Effective June 1, 2011, the DEPSC approved
a multi-year agreement for a phased-in base rate increase for Southern Shores.  This increase was made as a result of capital
investment in the upgrade and renovation of Southern Shores’ primary water treatment facilities, as well as by increased
operating costs.  Under the terms of the agreement, which expires on June 30, 2020, Southern Shores also increased rates on
January 1, 2012, and will do so on each successive January 1 st through 2015, to generate approximately $0.1 million
of additional revenue on an annual basis with each increase. Thereafter, rate increases, if any, cannot exceed the lesser of the
regional Consumer Price Index or 3%.
 
In accordance with the tariff established for
Southern Shores, a rate increase of 8.9% was implemented in January 2012.
 
Twin Lakes Rate Matters
 
In December 2011, Twin Lakes and the interveners
in the Twin Lakes Rate Case reached a settlement that provided a $0.1 million, three-year phased-in base rate increase for Twin
Lakes.  This increase was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of the Twin Lakes System, as
well as by increased operating costs.  The settlement was approved by the PAPUC in March 2012.
 
Future Rate Filings
 
Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater are
expected to also file for rate increases in 2012. There can be no assurances however, that the NJBPU will approve the anticipated
rate increase requests in whole or in part. In addition, the timing of approval of these rate requests is presently not known.
 
Water and Wastewater Quality and Environmental Regulations 
 
Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies
regulate our operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania with respect to water supply, treatment and distribution systems
and the quality of the water.  They also regulate our operations with respect to wastewater collection and treatment.
 
Regulations relating to water quality require
us to perform tests to ensure our water meets state and federal quality requirements. In addition, Government Environmental Regulatory
Agencies continuously review current regulations governing the limits of certain organic compounds found in the water as byproducts
of the treatment process. We participate in industry-related research to identify the various types of technology that might reduce
the level of organic, inorganic and synthetic compounds found in the water. The cost to water companies of complying with the proposed
water quality standards depends in part on the limits set in the regulations and on the method selected to treat the water to the
required standards. We regularly test our water to determine compliance with existing government environmental regulatory agencies’
primary water quality standards.
 
Well water treatment in our Middlesex System
is by chlorination for disinfection purposes. In addition, at certain locations, air stripping is used for removal of volatile
organic compounds.
 
Surface water treatment in our Middlesex
System is by conventional treatment; coagulation, sedimentation and filtration. The treatment process includes pH adjustment, chlorination
for disinfection, and corrosion control for the distribution system.
 
    8
    Table of Contents
    
Well water treatment in our Tidewater System
is by chlorination for disinfection purposes and, in some cases, pH correction and filtration for nitrate and iron removal.
 
Well water treatment in the Pinelands, Bayview
and Twin Lakes Systems (disinfection only) is performed at individual well sites.
 
The NJDEP, DEDPH and PADEP monitor our activities
and review the results of water quality tests that are performed for adherence to applicable regulations. Other applicable regulations
include the Federal Lead and Copper Rule, maximum contaminant levels established for various volatile organic compounds, the Federal
Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Federal Total Coliform Rule.
 
Seasonality
 
Customer demand for our water during the warmer
months is generally greater than other times of the year due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation
systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer
months, demand may vary with temperature and rainfall timing and overall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically
warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the customer demand for our water may decrease
and therefore, adversely affect our revenues.

Item 1A.
	Risk Factors.
 
Our revenue and earnings depend on the rates
we charge our customers. We cannot raise utility rates in our regulated businesses without filing a petition with the appropriate
Utility Commissions. If these agencies modify, delay, or deny our petition, our revenues will not increase and our earnings will
decline unless we are able to reduce costs.
 
The NJBPU regulates our public utility companies
in New Jersey with respect to rates and charges for service, classification of accounts, awards of new service territory, acquisitions,
financings and other matters. That means, for example, that we cannot raise the utility rates we charge to our customers without
first filing a petition with the NJBPU and going through a lengthy administrative process. In much the same way, the DEPSC and
the PAPUC regulate our public utility companies in Delaware and Pennsylvania, respectively. We cannot give assurance of when we
will request approval for any such matter, nor can we predict whether these Utility Commissions will approve, deny or reduce the
amount of such requests.
 
Certain costs of doing business are not completely
within our control. The failure to obtain any rate increase would prevent us from increasing our revenues and, unless we are able
to reduce costs, would result in reduced earnings.
    10
    Table of Contents
    
General economic conditions may materially
and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
Recent economic conditions have negatively
impacted our customers’ water usage demands, particularly the level of water usage demand by our commercial and industrial
customers in our Middlesex System. We are unable to determine when these customers’ water demands may return to previous
levels, or if the decline in demand will continue indefinitely. If water demand by our commercial and industrial customers in our
Middlesex System does not return to previous levels, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
 
Recent economic conditions have also impacted
the volume and pace of residential construction in our Delaware markets and in other states where developer-projects are in various
stages of completion. The timing and extent of recovery of our engineering and other preliminary survey and investigation (PS&I)
charges either from the construction of a project that yields customers or from reimbursements from a developer is dependent upon
the timing and extent to which such projects may or may not be further developed or from our ability to collect amounts contractually
owed to us. If it is determined that recovery is unlikely, the applicable PS&I costs will be charged against income in the
period of determination.
 
We are subject to environmental laws and
regulations, including water quality and wastewater effluent quality regulations, as well as other state and local regulations.
Compliance with those laws and regulations requires us to incur costs and we are subject to fines or other sanctions for non-compliance.
 
Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies
regulate our operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania with respect to water supply, treatment and distribution systems
and the quality of water. Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies’ regulations relating to water quality require us
to perform expanded types of testing to ensure that our water meets state and federal water quality requirements. We are subject
to EPA regulations under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which include the Lead and Copper Rule, the maximum contaminant levels
established for various volatile organic compounds, the Federal Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Total Coliform Rule. There
are also similar NJDEP regulations for our New Jersey water systems. The NJDEP, DEDPH and PADEP monitor our activities and review
the results of water quality tests that we perform for adherence to applicable regulations. In addition, Government Environmental
Regulatory Agencies are continually reviewing regulations governing the limits of certain organic compounds found in the water
as byproducts of treatment.
 
We are also subject to regulations related
to fire protection services in New Jersey and Delaware. In New Jersey there is no state-wide fire protection regulatory agency.
However, New Jersey regulations exist as to the size of piping required regarding the provision of fire protection services. In
Delaware, fire protection is regulated statewide by the Office of State Fire Marshal.
 
The cost of compliance with the water and wastewater
effluent quality standards depends in part on the limits set in the regulations and on the method selected to implement them. If
new or more restrictive standards are imposed, the cost of compliance could be very high and have an adverse impact on our revenues
and results of operations if we cannot recover those costs through our rates that we charge our customers. The cost of compliance
with fire protection requirements could also be high and make us less profitable if we cannot recover those costs through our rates
charged to our customers.
  
In addition, if we fail to comply
with environmental or other laws and regulations to which our business is subject, we could be fined or subject to other sanctions,
which could adversely impact our business or results of operations. 
 
    11
    Table of Contents
    
We depend upon our ability to raise money
in the capital markets to finance some of the costs of complying with laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations
or to pay for some of the costs of improvements to or the expansion of our utility system assets. Our regulated utility companies
cannot issue debt or equity securities without regulatory approval.
 
We require financing to fund the ongoing capital
program for the improvement of our utility system assets and for planned expansion of those systems. We expect to spend approximately
$56.2 million for capital projects through 2014. We must obtain regulatory approval to sell debt or equity securities to raise
money for these projects. If sufficient capital is not available or the cost of capital is too high, or if the regulatory authorities
deny a petition of ours to sell debt or equity securities, we may not be able to meet the costs of complying with environmental
laws and regulations or the costs of improving and expanding our utility system assets to the level we believe necessary. This
might result in the imposition of fines or restrictions on our operations and may curtail our ability to improve upon and expand
our utility system assets.
 
Weather conditions and overuse of underground
aquifers may interfere with our sources of water, demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers.
 
Our ability to meet the existing and future
water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. Unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply
sources. Drought and overuse of underground aquifers may limit the availability of ground and/or surface water. Freezing weather
may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and/or main breakage. Any interruption in our water supply
could cause a reduction in our revenue and profitability. These factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient
quantities to our customers. Governmental drought restrictions might result in decreased use of water services and can adversely
affect our revenue and earnings.
 
Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations,
which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues.
 
Demand for our water during the warmer months
is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation systems,
swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months,
demand may vary with temperature and rainfall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler
than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.
 
Our water sources may become contaminated
by naturally-occurring or man-made compounds and events. This may cause disruption in services and impose costs to restore the
water to required levels of quality.
 
Our sources of water may become contaminated
by naturally-occurring or man-made compounds and events. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt
the use of that water supply until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated
water source through our transmission and distribution systems. We may also incur significant costs in treating the contaminated
water through the use of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. Our inability to substitute
water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner
may reduce our revenues and make us less profitable.

    Table of Contents
    
We face competition from other water and
wastewater utilities and service providers which might hinder our growth and reduce our profitability.
 
We face risks of competition from other utilities
authorized by federal, state or local agencies. Once a state utility regulator grants a franchise to a utility to serve a specific
territory, that utility effectively has an exclusive right to service that territory. Although a new franchise offers some protection
against competitors, the pursuit of franchises is competitive, especially in Delaware, where new franchises may be awarded to utilities
based upon competitive negotiation. Competing utilities have challenged, and may in the future challenge, our applications for
new franchises. Also, third parties entering into long-term agreements to operate municipal systems might adversely affect us and
our long-term agreements to supply water on a contract basis to municipalities, which could adversely affect our operating results.
 
We have a long-term contractual obligation
for water and wastewater system operation and maintenance under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received.
 
USA-PA operates and maintains the water and
wastewater systems of the City of Perth Amboy, New Jersey under a 20-year contract expiring in 2018. This contract does not protect
us against incurring costs in excess of revenues we earn pursuant to the contract. There can be no absolute assurance that we will
not experience losses resulting from this contract. Losses under this contract, or our failure or inability to perform, may have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
An important element of our growth strategy
is the acquisition of water and wastewater assets, operations, contracts or companies. Any pending or future acquisitions we decide
to undertake may involve risks.
 
The acquisition and/or operation of water and
wastewater systems is an important element in our growth strategy. This strategy depends on identifying suitable opportunities
and reaching mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates or contract partners. These negotiations, as well as the integration
of acquired businesses, could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources.
Further, acquisitions may result in dilution of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, fluctuations
in quarterly results and other related expenses. In addition, the assets, operations, contracts or companies we acquire may not
achieve the sales and profitability expected.
 
The current concentration of our business
in central New Jersey and Delaware makes us susceptible to any adverse development in local regulatory, economic, demographic,
competitive and weather conditions.
 
Our New Jersey water and wastewater businesses
provide services to customers who are located primarily in eastern Middlesex County, New Jersey. Water service is provided under
wholesale contracts to the Townships of Edison and Marlboro, the Boroughs of Highland Park and Sayreville, the Old Bridge Municipal
Utilities Authority, and the City of Rahway in Union County, New Jersey. We also provide water and wastewater services to customers
in the State of Delaware. Our revenues and operating results are therefore subject to local regulatory, economic, demographic,
competitive and weather conditions in a relatively concentrated geographic area. A change in any of these conditions could make
it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. In addition, any such change would have a disproportionate effect on
us, compared to water utility companies that do not have such a geographic concentration.
 
    13
    Table of Contents
    
The necessity for ongoing security has and
may continue to result in increased operating costs.
 
Because of the continuing threats to the health
and security of the United States of America, we employ procedures to review and modify, as necessary, security measures at our
facilities. We provide ongoing training and communications to our employees about threats to our water supply and to their personal
safety. Our security measures include protocols regarding delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We are
at risk for terrorist attacks and have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs for security measures to protect our facilities,
operations and supplies from such risks.
 
Our ability to achieve growth in our market
area is dependent on the residential building market. Housing starts impact our rate of growth and therefore, may not meet our
expectations.
 
We expect our revenues to increase from customer
growth for our regulated water and wastewater operations as a result of anticipated construction and sale of new housing units.
Although the residential building market in Delaware has experienced growth in recent years, this growth has slowed due to current
economic conditions. If housing starts decline further, or do not increase as we have projected, as a result of economic conditions
or otherwise, the timing and extent of our revenue growth may not meet our expectations, our deferred project costs may not produce
revenue-generating projects in the timeframes anticipated and our financial results could be negatively impacted.
 
There can be no assurance that we will continue
to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.
 
We have paid dividends on our common stock
each year since 1912 and have increased the amount of dividends paid each year since 1973. Our earnings, financial condition, capital
requirements, applicable regulations and other factors, including the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases, will determine
both our ability to pay dividends on common stock and the amount of those dividends. There can be no assurance that we will continue
to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.
 
If we are unable to pay the principal and
interest on our indebtedness as it comes due or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness
could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 
Our ability to pay the principal and interest
on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors,
some of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, borrowings under our
existing credit facilities will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not
generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that
are not as favorable to us.
 
No assurance can be given that any refinancing
or sale or equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure
to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness
could lead to a default under these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.

We depend significantly on the services
of the members of our senior management team, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer.
 
Our success depends significantly on the continued
individual and collective contributions of our senior management team. If we lose the services of any member of our senior management
or are unable to hire and retain experienced management personnel, our operating results could be negatively impacted.
 
We are subject to anti-takeover measures
that may be used by existing management to discourage, delay or prevent changes of control that might benefit non-management shareholders.
 
Subsection 10A of the New Jersey Business Corporation
Act, known as the New Jersey Shareholders Protection Act, applies to us. The Shareholders Protection Act deters merger proposals,
tender offers or other attempts to effect changes in control that are not approved by our Board of Directors. In addition, we have
a classified Board of Directors, which means only one-third of the Directors are elected each year. A classified Board can make
it harder for an acquirer to gain control by voting its candidates onto the Board of Directors and may also deter merger proposals
and tender offers. Our Board of Directors also has the ability, subject to obtaining NJBPU approval, to issue one or more series
of preferred stock having such number of shares, designation, preferences, voting rights, limitations and other rights as the Board
of Directors may fix. This could be used by the Board of Directors to discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition that the Board
of Directors determines is not in the best interest of the common stockholders.

The Company has paid dividends on its
common stock each year since 1912. The payment of future dividends is contingent upon the future earnings of the Company, its financial
condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors at its discretion.
 
If four or more quarterly dividends are
in arrears, the preferred shareholders, as a class, are entitled to elect two members to the Board of Directors in addition to
Directors elected by holders of the common stock. In the event dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears, no dividends may
be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company.
 
In June 2010, the Company sold and issued
1.9 million shares of common stock in a public offering that was priced at $15.21 per share. The net proceeds of approximately
$27.8 million were used to repay certain of the Company’s short-term debt outstanding.
 
The Company periodically issues shares of common
stock in connection with its Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (the DRP). The Company raised approximately $1.5
million through the issuance of 0.1 million shares under the Plan during 2011.
 
The Company has a stock compensation plan for
certain management employees (the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan). The Company maintains an escrow account for 0.1 million awarded
shares of the Company's common stock for the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan. Such stock is subject to an agreement requiring forfeiture
by the employee in the event of termination of employment within five years of the award other than as a result of retirement,
death, disability or change in control. The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan
is 0.3 million shares and 0.2 million shares remain available for future awards under the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan.
 
The Company has a stock compensation plan for
its outside directors (the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan). In 2011, 3,833 shares of common stock were granted and issued
to the Company’s outside directors under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan. The maximum number of shares authorized
for grant under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan is 100,000. 93,197 shares remain available for future grants under
the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan.

Item
7.	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.
 
The following discussion of the Company’s
historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial
statements and related notes.
 
Management’s Overview 
 
Operations
 
Middlesex Water Company has operated as a water
utility in New Jersey since 1897, in Delaware through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tidewater, since 1992 and in Pennsylvania through
our wholly-owned subsidiary, Twin Lakes, since 2009. We are in the business of collecting, treating and distributing water for
domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial and fire protection purposes. We also operate a New Jersey municipal water and wastewater
system under contract and provide regulated wastewater services in New Jersey and Delaware through our subsidiaries. We are regulated
as to rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services, as to the quality of water service we provide and as to certain
other matters in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Only our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries are not regulated utilities.
 
    20
    Table of Contents
    
Our New Jersey water utility system (the Middlesex
System) provides water services to approximately 60,000 retail customers, primarily in central New Jersey. The Middlesex System
also provides water service under contract to municipalities in central New Jersey with a total population of approximately 303,000.
In partnership with our subsidiary, USA-PA, we operate the water supply system and wastewater system for the City of Perth Amboy,
New Jersey. Our Bayview subsidiary provides water services in Downe Township, New Jersey. Our other New Jersey subsidiaries, Pinelands
Water and Pinelands Wastewater, provide water and wastewater services to residents in Southampton Township, New Jersey.
 
USA offers residential customers in New Jersey
and Delaware water service line and sewer lateral maintenance programs (LineCare). In August 2011, USA entered into a 10-year marketing
agreement (the Agreement) with HomeServe, a leading provider of home maintenance service programs to service, develop and grow
USA’s LineCare customer base. During this period, USA will receive a service fee for the billing, cash collection and other
administrative matters associated with HomeServe’s service contracts.
 
Our Delaware subsidiaries, Tidewater and Southern
Shores, provide water services to approximately 36,000 retail customers in New Castle, Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware. Tidewater’s
subsidiary, White Marsh, services approximately 4,700 customers in Kent and Sussex Counties through various operations and maintenance
contracts.
 
Our TESI subsidiary provides wastewater services
to approximately 2,200 residential retail customers. We expect the growth of our regulated wastewater operations in Delaware will
eventually become a more significant component of our operations.
 
Our Pennsylvania subsidiary, Twin Lakes, provides
water services to approximately 120 retail customers in the Township of Shohola, Pike County, Pennsylvania.
 
The majority of our revenue is generated from
retail and contract water services to customers in our regulated service areas. We record water service revenue as such service
is rendered and include estimates for amounts unbilled at the end of the period for services provided after the last billing cycle.
Fixed service charges are billed in advance by our subsidiary, Tidewater, and are recognized in revenue as the service is provided.
 
Recent Developments
 
Investment in Ridgewood Green RME, LLC -
Middlesex and NSU Ridgewood, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Natural Systems Utilities, LLC, formed a joint venture, Ridgewood
Green RME, LLC, (Ridgewood Green), which entered into a 20-year public-private partnership with the Village of Ridgewood, New Jersey
(Ridgewood) whereby Ridgewood Green will design, build, own and operate facilities to optimize the production of electricity at
Ridgewood's municipal wastewater treatment plant. Operation of the facilities is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. Wastewater

Rates
 
Middlesex - In January 2012, Middlesex
filed an application with the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $11.3 million per year. The
request was as a result of capital investments Middlesex has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations and
maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request. A decision
by the NJBPU is not expected until the fourth quarter 2012.
 
In August 2011, Middlesex implemented a NJBPU
approved PWAC, which allows for the recovery of increased costs of $0.4 million to purchase untreated water from the NJWSA and
treated water from a non-affiliated regulated water utility. It is expected that the PWAC rate will reset to zero as part of the
ultimate decision rendered in the aforementioned Middlesex base rate increase request.
 
In March 2010, the NJBPU granted an increase
in Middlesex’s annual operating revenues of 13.57%, or $7.8 million. The increase was necessitated by increased costs,
as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of $180.3 million based on a return on equity of 10.30%.
 
Tidewater – In September 2011,
Tidewater filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $6.9 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments Tidewater has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until the second half of 2012. In connection with the rate increase application, Tidewater
implemented a DEPSC approved 10.49% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on November 15, 2011.

A DSIC is a DEPSC approved rate-mechanism that
allows water utilities to recover investment in non-revenue producing capital improvements to the water system between base rate
proceedings. The following summarizes Tidewater’s approved DSIC rates from January 1, 2011 through November 15, 2011, when
Tidewater’s DSIC was set to 0.0% in connection with the aforementioned 10.49% interim rate increase:
 
    Date

    % Increase
    0.27%
    0.64%
    Cumulative %
    1.34%
    1.98%
 
In September 2009, the DEPSC approved an overall
14.95% or $3.0 million increase in Tidewater’s base rates. This rate increase approval is based on a 10.0% return on equity.
 
TESI – In July 2011,
TESI filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $0.8 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments TESI has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until mid 2012. In connection with the rate increase application, TESI implemented a DEPSC
approved 7.6% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on September 28, 2011.
 
Southern Shores – Effective
June 1, 2011, the DEPSC approved a multi-year agreement for a phased-in base rate increase for Southern Shores.  This increase
was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of Southern Shores’ primary water treatment facilities,
as well as by increased operating costs.  Under the terms of the agreement, which expires on June 30, 2020, Southern Shores
also increased rates on January 1, 2012, and will do so on each successive January 1 st through 2015, to generate approximately
$0.1 million of additional revenue on an annual basis with each increase. Thereafter, rate increases, if any, cannot exceed the
lesser of the regional Consumer Price Index or 3%.
 
In accordance with the tariff established for
Southern Shores, a rate increase of 8.9% was implemented in January 2012.
 
Twin Lakes – In
December 2011, Twin Lakes and the interveners in the Twin Lakes Rate Case reached a settlement that provided a $0.1 million,
three-year phased-in base rate increase for Twin Lakes.  This increase was made as a result of capital investment in the
upgrade and renovation of the Twin Lakes System, as well as by increased operating costs.  The settlement was approved
by the PAPUC in March 2012.
 
Outlook 
 
Revenues for 2012 are expected to be favorably
impacted by interim and final approved rate increases at Middlesex, Tidewater, TESI, Southern Shores and Twin Lakes. In addition,
Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater expect to file for rate increases in 2012. The rate increases that Middlesex, Tidewater,
TESI, Twin Lakes, Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater filed, or expect to file, have not been approved by each company’s
respective Utility Commission. There can be no assurances that the requested rate increases will be approved in whole or in part
or when the final decisions will be rendered.
 
Ongoing economic conditions continue to negatively
impact our customers’ water consumption, particularly the level of water usage by our commercial and industrial customers
in our Middlesex system. In the second half of 2010, we began to see an increase in usage by our commercial and industrial customers.
However, we are unable to determine when these customers’ water demands may fully return to previous levels, or if a reduced
level of demand will continue indefinitely. We were given appropriate recognition for a portion of this decrease in customer consumption
in Middlesex’s March 2010 rate increase.
 
    23
    Table of Contents
    
Revenues and earnings are influenced by weather.
Overall customer water consumption decreased in 2011 due to less favorable weather as compared to 2010. Changes in usage patterns,
as well as increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, are the primary factors in determining the need for rate increase
requests. We continue to implement plans to streamline operations and reduce operating costs.
 
As a result of ongoing challenging economic
conditions impacting the pace of new residential home construction, there may be an increase in the amount of PS&I costs that
will not be currently recoverable in rates. If it is determined that recovery is unlikely, the applicable PS&I costs will be
charged against income in the period of determination.
 
Changes in certain actuarial assumptions, including
a lower discount rate and revised plan participant mortality factors, as well as a lower actual return in 2011 on assets held in
our retirement plan funds resulted in a significant increase in our underfunded employee benefit plan obligation and will result in higher employee benefit plan expense and cash contributions in 2012.  Tidewater and Middlesex have included these
increased plan expenses in their rate increase applications currently under review by the respective Utility Commissions. 
 See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Employee Benefit Plans.
 
Operating Results by Segment 
 
Our ability to increase operating income and
net income is based significantly on four factors: weather, adequate and timely rate relief, effective cost management, and customer
growth. These factors are evident in the discussions below which compare our results of operations from prior years.
 
The Company has two operating segments, Regulated
and Non-Regulated. Our Regulated segment contributed approximately 90%, 90% and 88% of total revenues, and approximately 91%, 92%
and 87% of net income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The discussion of the Company’s
results of operations is on a consolidated basis, and includes significant factors by subsidiary. The segments in the tables included
below are comprised of the following companies: Regulated- Middlesex, Tidewater, Pinelands, Southern Shores, TESI and Twin Lakes;
Non-Regulated- USA, USA-PA, and White Marsh.

Operating Revenues
 
Operating revenues for the year ended December
31, 2011 decreased $0.6 million from the same period in 2010. This decrease was primarily related to the following factors:
 
· Middlesex System revenues decreased $0.3 million, primarily
due to the following:
o Lower consumption by our residential and contract customers
resulting from cooler temperatures and higher precipitation during the summer of 2011 as compared to 2010;
o Decreased contract sales due to the ending of a temporary
contract to supply water to the City of Perth Amboy in 2010; offset by
o Increased sales to industrial customers;
· Tidewater System revenues decreased $0.4 million, primarily
due to the following:
o Lower consumption attributable to similar unfavorable
weather patterns experienced in the Middlesex System in 2011 as compared to 2010;
o Lower connection fees resulting from a depressed housing
market; offset by
o Increased fixed service charges for new customers;
· White Marsh’s revenues decreased $0.2 million primarily
due to the expiration of a wastewater operations contract in August 2011;
· With the transfer of USA’s LineCare contracts to
HomeServe, USA’s revenues decreased $0.2 million. USA now earns a service fee for the billing, cash collection and other
administrative matters associated with HomeServe’s service contracts;
· Scheduled increases in the fixed fees paid under contract
with the City of Perth Amboy increased USA-PA’s revenues by $0.4 million; and
· Southern Shores revenues increased $0.1 million due to
the implementation of a June 2011 rate increase.
 
Operation and Maintenance Expense
 
Operation and maintenance expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2011 increased $1.1 million from the same period in 2010. This increase was primarily related to the following
factors:
 
· Labor costs increased $0.3 million due to annual wage
increases and lower capitalized labor;
· Employee healthcare costs and postretirement benefit
plan expenses increased $1.1 million;
· Increased net costs of $0.3 million from the implementation
of a company wide information technology platform;
· Scheduled increases in subcontractor charges of $0.3
million at our USA-PA subsidiary;
· Increased transportation charges of $0.1 million due
to higher average gasoline prices;
· Unfavorable weather resulted in lower consumption which
decreased production costs by $0.5 million;
· Decreased water main break costs of $0.6 million, as

Operating Revenues
 
Operating revenues for the year ended December
31, 2010 increased $11.5 million from the same period in 2009. This increase was primarily related to the following factors:
 
· Revenues in our Middlesex System increased $8.5 million,
primarily as a result of the following:
o Contract Sales to Municipalities increased by $2.6 million
due to higher customer demand for water and the March 2010 rate increase;
o Sales to General Metered Service (GMS) Customers increased
by $4.0 million from the implementation of the March 2010 base water rate increase ($3.2 million) and increased customer demand
for water ($0.8 million). The increased demand primarily resulted from hot, dry weather in the summer months and an increase in
demand by our commercial and industrial customers in the 3 rd and 4 th quarters of 2010, which mitigated decreased
demand through the six months ended June 30, 2010. In 2009 and through the 2 nd quarter of 2010, water consumption by
our commercial and industrial customer class was below the historical average;
o Facilities Charges increased by $2.0 million from the
March 2010 rate increase; and
o All other revenue categories decreased $0.1 million.
· Revenues in our Tidewater System increased $2.7 million
primarily from the following:
o Higher demand by our GMS customers ($1.5 million);
o Increased base water rates that went into effect during
2009 ($0.4 million);
o A contract to temporarily provide water to Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware ($0.4 million);
o New customer growth increased connection fees and facilities
charges ($0.5 million); and
o All other revenue categories decreased $0.1 million.
· Additional services provided by White Marsh under non-regulated
contracts increased revenues by $0.2 million.
· All other subsidiaries’ revenues collectively increased
$0.1 million.

Operation and Maintenance Expense
 
Operation and maintenance expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2010 increased $3.2 million from the same period in 2009. This increase was primarily related to the following
factors:
 
· Increased material and supply and outside contractor
costs of $0.8 million due to water main breaks in our Middlesex and Tidewater Systems;
· Increased purchased water costs of $0.5 million in our
Middlesex and Tidewater Systems, primarily from the aforementioned increased customer demand;
· Increased net costs of $0.5 million from the implementation
of a Company-wide information technology platform;
· Increased labor costs of $0.9 million related to higher
average labor rates and increased overtime related to higher water production and increased main breaks in our Middlesex and Tidewater
Systems.
· Increased employee benefit costs of $0.2 million primarily
related to higher life insurance expenses resulting from market fluctuations in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies;
and
· All other operation and maintenance expense categories
collectively increased $0.3 million.
 
Depreciation
 
Depreciation expense for the year ended December
31, 2010 increased $0.7 million from the same period in 2009 due to a higher level of utility plant in service.
 
Other Taxes

Net Income and Earnings Per Share
 
Favorable results for the year ended December
31, 2010 increased net income by $4.3 million when compared to the same period in 2009. Basic and diluted earnings per share increased
to $0.96 for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $0.73 and $0.72, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The increase in earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 was tempered by
an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding after the Company’s public offering of 1.9 million shares
of common stock in June 2010.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  
Cash flows from operations are largely based
on four factors: weather, adequate and timely rate increases, effective cost management and customer growth. The effect of those
factors on net income is discussed in the Results of Operations section above.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2011,
cash flows from operating activities decreased $2.7 million to $22.8 million. As described more fully in the Results
of Operations section above, decreased earnings was the primary reason for the decrease in cash flow. The $22.8 million of
net cash flow from operations enabled us to fund approximately 97% of our utility plant expenditures internally for
the period.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash
flows from operating activities increased $7.1 million to $25.6 million. As described more fully in the Results of Operations section
above, increased earnings was the primary reason for the increase in cash flow. The $25.6 million of net cash flow from operations
enabled us to fund approximately 86% of our utility plant expenditures internally for the period.
 
Increases in certain operating costs impact
our liquidity and capital resources. Middlesex and several of its subsidiaries filed for rate increases in 2011 and January 2012.
There can be no assurances however, that the respective Utility Commissions will approve the anticipated rate increase requests
in whole or in part or when the decisions will be rendered. We continually monitor the need for timely rate filing to minimize
the lag between the time we experience increased operating and capital costs and the time we receive appropriate rate relief.
 
Capital Expenditures and Commitments
 
To fund our capital program, we use internally
generated funds, short term and long term debt borrowings, and when market conditions are favorable, proceeds from sales of common
stock under our DRP and offerings to the public.
 
The table below summarizes our estimated capital
expenditures for the years 2012-2014.

Our estimated capital expenditures for the
items listed above are primarily comprised of the following:
· Distribution System -Projects associated with installation
and relocation of water mains and service lines, construction of water storage tanks, installation and replacement of hydrants
and meters and our RENEW Program, which is our program to clean and cement unlined mains in the Middlesex System. In connection
with our RENEW Program, we expect to spend $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $4.0 million for 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
· Production System -Projects associated with our
water production and water treatment plants.
· Computer Systems -Purchase of hardware and software
as well as expected costs to complete implementation of our enterprise resource planning system.
· Other -Purchase of vehicles and other transportation
equipment, tools, furniture, laboratory equipment, security requirements and other general infrastructure needs.
 
The actual amount and timing of capital expenditures
is dependent on customer growth, residential new home construction and sales and project scheduling.
 
To pay for our capital program in 2012, we plan on utilizing:
· Internally generated funds
· Proceeds from the sale of common stock through the DRP
· Funds available and held in trust under existing New Jersey State Revolving Fund (SRF)
loans (currently, $1.8 million) and Delaware SRF loans (currently, $2.0 million) and, once the loan transaction is complete, proceeds
from the 2012 New Jersey SRF program. SRF programs provide low cost financing for projects that meet certain water quality and
system improvement benchmarks.
· Short-term borrowings, if necessary, through $60.0 million of available lines of credit
with several financial institutions. As of December 31, 2011, we had $24.3 million outstanding against the lines of credit.
 
Sources of Liquidity
 
Short-term
Debt. The Company had established lines of credit aggregating $60.0 million as of December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011,
the outstanding borrowings under these credit lines were $24.3 million at a weighted average interest rate of 1.33%.
 
The weighted average daily amounts of borrowings
outstanding under the Company’s credit lines and the weighted average interest rates on those amounts were $20.7 million
and $26.4 million at 1.44% and 1.58% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
 
Long-term Debt. Subject to regulatory
approval, the Company periodically finances capital projects under SRF loan programs in New Jersey and Delaware. These government
programs provide financing at interest rates that are typically below rates available in the broader financial markets. A portion
of the borrowings under the New Jersey SRF is interest-free. We participated in the New Jersey and Delaware SRF loan programs during
2011 and expect to participate in the 2012 New Jersey SRF program for up $4.0 million, with an expected closing date in May 2012.
 
In March 2011, Tidewater closed on a $2.8 million
loan with the Delaware SRF program which allows, but does not obligate, Tidewater to draw against a General Obligation Note for
a specific project. The interest rate on any draw will be set at 3.75% with a final maturity of July 1, 2031 on the amount actually
borrowed. As of December 31, 2011, Tidewater has borrowed $2.0 million under this loan.
 
In March 2011, Southern Shores closed on a
$1.6 million loan with the Delaware SRF program, which allows, but does not obligate, Southern Shores to draw against a General
Obligation Note for a specific project. The interest rate on any draw will be set at 3.75% with a final maturity of November 30,
2030 on the amount actually borrowed. As of December 31, 2011, Southern Shores has borrowed $1.4 million under this loan.

In February 2010, Tidewater closed on a $1.1
million loan with the Delaware SRF. This loan allows, but does not obligate, Tidewater to draw down against a General Obligation
Note for a specific project. The interest rate on any draw-down will be set at 3.45% with a final maturity of August 1, 2031 on
the amount actually borrowed. As of December 31, 2011, Tidewater has borrowed $39 thousand under this loan.
 
In March 2009, Tidewater closed on a $22.0
million DEPSC approved loan. In 2009, Tidewater borrowed $12.0 million under this loan. In March 2010, Tidewater borrowed the remaining
$10.0 million at a rate of 5.69% with a final maturity in January 2030.
 
In December 2010, Middlesex issued $4.0 million
of first mortgage bonds through the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Trust under the New Jersey SRF program. The Company
closed on the first mortgage bonds designated as Series MM and NN in December 2010. Proceeds from the Series MM and NN bonds are
included in Restricted Cash and will be used for Middlesex’s 2011 RENEW Program.
 
Substantially all of the Utility Plant
of the Company is subject to the lien of its mortgage, which includes debt service and capital ratio covenants. The Company is
in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions.
 
Common Stock . In June 2010, the
Company sold and issued 1.9 million shares of common stock in a public offering that was priced at $15.21 per share. The net proceeds
of approximately $27.8 million were used to repay certain of the Company’s short-term debt outstanding.
 
The Company periodically issues shares of common
stock in connection with its DRP. The Company raised $1.5 million through the issuance of 0.1 million shares under the DRP during
2011.
 
Contractual Obligations
 
In the course of normal business activities,
the Company enters into a variety of contractual obligations and commercial commitments. Some of these items result in direct obligations
on the Company’s balance sheet while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, which are disclosed
in the Company’s other underlying consolidated financial statements.

The table above does not reflect any anticipated
cash payments for postretirement benefit plan obligations. The effect on the timing and amount of these payments resulting from
potential changes in actuarial assumptions and returns on plan assets cannot be estimated. In 2011, the Company contributed $6.9
million to its postretirement benefit plans and expects to contribute approximately $8.9 million in 2012.
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
The application of accounting policies and
standards often requires the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company regularly evaluates these estimates, assumptions
and judgments, including those related to the calculation of pension and postretirement benefits, unbilled revenues, and the recoverability
of certain assets, including regulatory assets. The Company bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience
and current operating environment. Changes in any of the variables that are used for the Company’s estimates, assumptions
and judgments may lead to significantly different financial statement results.
 
Our critical accounting policies are set forth
below.
 
Regulatory Accounting
 
We maintain our books and records in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Middlesex and certain of its subsidiaries, which
account for approximately 90% of Operating Revenues and 98% of Total Assets, are subject to regulation in the states in which they
operate. Those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities’ rules and guidelines,
which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows the guidance in the
Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 980 Regulated Operations (Regulatory Accounting).
 
In accordance with Regulatory Accounting, costs
and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate-making purposes in future rates. Accordingly,
we have recorded costs and obligations, which will be amortized over various future periods. Any change in the assessment of the
probability of rate-making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item. We have no reason
to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future.
 
 
    32
    Table of Contents
    
Revenues 
 
Revenues from metered customers include amounts
billed on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting period. The
estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current climate and
economic conditions. Differences between estimated revenues and actual billings are recorded in a subsequent period.
 
Revenues from unmetered customers are billed
at a fixed tariff rate in advance at the beginning of each service period and are recognized in revenue ratably over the service
period.
 
Revenues from the Perth Amboy management contract
are comprised of fixed and variable fees. Fixed fees, which have been set for the life of the contract, are billed monthly and
recorded as earned. Variable fees, which are based on billings and other factors and are not material, are recorded upon approval
of the amount by Perth Amboy.
 
Postretirement Benefit Plans
 
The costs for providing postretirement benefits
are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Future postretirement
benefit plan obligations and expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various
other demographic factors related to the population participating in the Company’s postretirement benefit plans, all of which
can change significantly in future years.
 
We maintain a noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) which covers substantially all employees who were hired prior to March 31, 2007. In addition,
the Company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers.
 
The Company has a postretirement benefit
plan other than pensions (Other Benefits Plan) for substantially all of its retired employees. Employees hired after March 31,
2007 are not eligible to participate in the Other Benefits Plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance.
 
The allocation by asset category of postretirement
benefit plan assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:

For the 2011 valuation, costs and
obligations for our Other Benefits Plan assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare
benefits in 2012 with a decline of 1.0% per year for 2013-2015 and 0.5% per year for 2016-2017, resulting in an annual rate
of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 5% by year 2017.

The discount rates used at our December 31
measurement date for determining future postretirement benefit plans’ obligations and costs are determined based on market
rates for long-term, high-quality corporate bonds specific to our Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan’s asset allocation.
The expected long-term rate of return for Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan assets is determined based on historical returns
and our asset allocation.

Item 7A.	Qualitative
and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuating
interest rates in the normal course of business. Our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of fixed rate long-term
debt and, to a lesser extent, short-term debt. The Company’s interest rate risk related to existing fixed rate, long-term
debt is not material due to the term of the majority of our First Mortgage Bonds, which have final maturity dates ranging from
2018 to 2038. Over the next twelve months, approximately $4.6 million of the current portion of 31 existing long-term debt instruments
will mature. Applying a hypothetical change in the rate of interest charged by 10% on those borrowings, would not have a material
effect on our earnings.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Middlesex Water Company
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and consolidated statements of capital stock and long-term debt of Middlesex Water Company (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Middlesex Water Company as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their  operations and  their cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
 
We also have audited,
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Middlesex
Water Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO), and our report dated March 8, 2012 expressed an unqualified
opinion.

Middlesex Water Company
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Note 1 – Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Recent Developments
 
(a) Organization - Middlesex
Water Company (Middlesex) is the parent company and sole shareholder of Tidewater Utilities, Inc. (Tidewater), Tidewater Environmental
Services, Inc. (TESI), Pinelands Water Company (Pinelands Water) and Pinelands Wastewater Company (Pinelands Wastewater) (collectively,
Pinelands), Utility Service Affiliates, Inc. (USA), Utility Service Affiliates (Perth Amboy) Inc. (USA-PA) and Twin Lakes Utilities,
Inc. (Twin Lakes). Southern Shores Water Company, LLC (Southern Shores) and White Marsh Environmental Systems, Inc. (White Marsh)
are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Tidewater. The financial statements for Middlesex and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company)
are reported on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Middlesex Water Company has operated as a water
utility in New Jersey since 1897, in Delaware, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tidewater, since 1992 and in Pennsylvania,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Twin Lakes, since 2009. We are in the business of collecting, treating, distributing and selling
water for domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial and fire protection purposes. We also operate a New Jersey municipal water
and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in New Jersey and Delaware through our subsidiaries. Our rates
charged to customers for water and wastewater services, the quality of services we provide and certain other matters are regulated
in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), Delaware Public Service Commission
(DEPSC) and Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC), respectively. Only our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries are
not regulated utilities.
 
Certain reclassifications have been made
to the prior year financial statements to conform with current period presentation.
 
(b) System of Accounts –
Middlesex, Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater maintain their accounts in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts
prescribed by the NJBPU. Tidewater, TESI and Southern Shores maintain their accounts in accordance with DEPSC requirements. Twin
Lakes maintains its accounts in accordance with PAPUC requirements.
 
(c) Utility Plant –
Utility Plant is stated at original cost as defined for regulatory purposes. Property accounts are charged with the cost of
betterments and major replacements of property. Cost includes direct material, labor and indirect charges for pension benefits
and payroll taxes. The cost of labor, materials, supervision and other expenses incurred in making repairs and minor replacements
and in maintaining the properties is charged to the appropriate expense accounts. At December 31, 2011, there was no event or change
in circumstance that would indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset was not recoverable.
 
(d) Depreciation –
Depreciation is computed by each regulated member of the Company utilizing a rate approved by the applicable regulatory authority.
The Accumulated Provision for Depreciation is charged with the cost of property retired, less salvage. The following table sets
forth the range of depreciation rates for 
    41
    Table of Contents
    
the major utility plant categories used
to calculate depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. These rates have been approved by the NJBPU,
DEPSC or PAPUC:
 
    Source of Supply
    1.15% -   3.44%
    Transmission and Distribution (T&D):
    Pumping
    2.87% -   5.39%
    T&D – Mains
    1.10%  -   3.13%
    Water Treatment
    1.65% -   7.09%
    T&D – Services
    2.12%  -   3.16%
    General Plant
    2.08% - 17.84%
    T&D – Other
    1.61%  -   4.63%
 
Non-regulated fixed assets consist primarily
of office buildings, furniture and fixtures, and transportation equipment. These assets are recorded at original cost and depreciation
is calculated based on the estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 40 years.
 
(e) Preliminary Survey and Investigation
(PS&I) Costs – In the design of water and wastewater systems that the Company ultimately intends to
construct, own and operate certain expenditures are incurred to advance those project activities. These PS&I costs are recorded
as deferred charges on the balance sheet because these costs are expected to be recovered through future rates charged to customers
as the underlying projects are placed into service as utility plant. If it is subsequently determined that costs for a project
recorded as PS&I are not recoverable through rates charged to our customers, the applicable PS&I costs are recorded as
a charge to the income statement at that time.
 
(f) Customers’
Advances for Construction (CAC) – Water utility plant and/or cash advances are contributed to the Company by
customers, real estate developers and builders in order to extend water service to their properties. These contributions are
recorded as CAC. Refunds on these advances are made by the Company in accordance with agreements with the contributing party
and are based on either additional operating revenues related to the utility plant or as new customers are connected to and
take service from the utility plant. After all refunds are made and/or contract terms have expired, any remaining balance
is transferred to Contributions in Aid of Construction.
 
Contributions in Aid of Construction
(CIAC) – CIAC include direct non-refundable contributions of water utility plant and/or cash and the portion of CAC
that becomes non-refundable.
 
CAC and CIAC are not depreciated in accordance
with regulatory requirements. In addition, these amounts reduce the investment base for purposes of setting rates.
 
(g) Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC) - Middlesex and its regulated subsidiaries capitalize AFUDC, which represents the cost of financing
projects during construction. AFUDC is added to the construction costs of individual projects exceeding specific cost and construction
period thresholds established for each company and then depreciated along with the rest of the utility plant’s costs over
its estimated useful life. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately $0.8 million, $1.0 million, and
$1.0 million, respectively of AFUDC was added to the cost of construction projects. AFUDC is calculated using each company’s
weighted cost of debt and equity as approved in their most recent respective regulatory rate order. The AFUDC rates for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for Middlesex and Tidewater are as follows:
 
     
    For The Year Ended December 31, 
     
    2011
    2010
    2009
    Middlesex
    7.54%
    7.54%
    7.65%
    Tidewater
    8.24%
    8.24%
    8.24%
    42
    Table of Contents
    
(h) Accounts Receivable –
We record bad debt expense based on historical write-offs combined with an evaluation of current conditions. The allowance for
doubtful accounts was $0.6 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Bad debt expense for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Receivables not expected
to be received in 2012 are included as non-current assets in Operations and Developer Contracts Receivable.
 
(i) Revenues - General metered
customer’s bills for regulated water service are typically comprised of two components; a fixed service charge and a volumetric
or consumption charge. Revenues from general metered service water customers, except Tidewater fixed service charges, include amounts
billed in arrears on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting
period. The estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current
climate and economic conditions. Actual billings may differ from our estimates. Tidewater customers are billed in advance for their
fixed service charge and these revenues are recognized as the service is provided to the customer.
 
Southern Shores is an unmetered system. Customers
are billed a fixed service charge in advance at the beginning of each month and revenues are recognized as earned.
 
Revenues from the City of Perth Amboy management
contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees. Fixed fees, which have been set for the life of the contract, are billed monthly
and recorded as earned. Variable fees, which are not significant, are recorded upon approval of the amount by the City of Perth
Amboy.
 
(j) Deferred Charges and Other
Assets - Unamortized Debt Expense is amortized over the lives of the related issues. Restricted Cash represents proceeds from
loans entered into through state financing programs and is held in trusts. The proceeds are restricted for specific capital expenditures
and debt service requirements.
 
(k) Income Taxes - Middlesex
files a consolidated federal income tax return for the Company and income taxes are allocated based on the separate return method.
Investment tax credits have been deferred and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the related property. For more information
on income taxes, see Note 3 – Income Taxes.
 
(l) Statements of Cash Flows
- For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents represent bank balances and money market funds with investments
maturing in less than 90 days.
 
(m) Use of Estimates - Conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
(n) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
- In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-04, which
amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (ASC 820), to update guidance
related to fair value measurements and disclosures as a step towards achieving convergence between generally accepted accounting
principles and international financial reporting standards. ASU 2011-04 clarifies intent about application of existing fair value
measurements and disclosures, changes certain requirements for fair value measurements and requires expanded disclosures. ASU
2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Adoption of 2011-04 is not expected to
have any impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
 
In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, which amends ASC 820, to add new requirements for
disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of
disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Further, ASU 2010-06 amends guidance on
employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement
Benefits to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets.  Adoption
of ASU 2010-06 had no impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

    Table of Contents
    
(o) Regulatory Accounting - We
maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Middlesex
and certain of its subsidiaries, which account for 90% of Operating Revenues and 98% of Total Assets, are subject to regulation
in the state in which they operate. Those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities’
rules and guidelines, which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows
the guidance provided in ASC 980, Regulated Operations .
 
In accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations ,
costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate-making purposes in future rates.
Accordingly, we have recorded costs and obligations, which will be amortized over various future periods. Any change in the assessment
of the probability of rate-making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item. We have no
reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future. For
additional information, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters.
 
(p) Postretirement Benefit Plans
- We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) which covers substantially all active employees who
were hired prior to March 31, 2007. In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers.
The Company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions (Other Benefits Plan) for substantially all of its retired employees.
Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate in this plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance.
 
The Company’s costs for providing postretirement
benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postretirement
benefit plan obligations and expense are determined based on investment performance, discount rates and various other demographic
factors related to the population participating in the Company’s postretirement benefit plans, all of which can change significantly
in future years. For more information on the Company’s Postretirement Benefit Plans, see Note 7 – Employee Benefit
Plans.

Note 2 - Rate and Regulatory Matters
 
Rate Matters
 
Middlesex - In January 2012, Middlesex
filed an application with the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $11.3 million per year. The
request was made as a result of capital investments Middlesex has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the NJBPU is not expected until the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
In August 2011, Middlesex implemented a NJBPU
approved Purchased Water Adjustment Clause (PWAC), which allows for the recovery of increased costs of $0.4 million to purchase
untreated water from the New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) and treated water from a non-affiliated regulated water utility.
It is expected that the PWAC rate will reset to zero as part of the ultimate decision rendered in the aforementioned Middlesex
base rate increase request.
 
In March 2010, the NJBPU granted
an increase in Middlesex’s annual operating revenues of 13.57%, or $7.8 million. The increase was  necessitated
by increased costs, as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of $180.3 million based on a return on
equity of 10.30%.
 
Tidewater – In September 2011,
Tidewater filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $6.9 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments Tidewater has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until the second half of 2012. In connection with the base rate increase request, Tidewater
implemented a DEPSC approved 10.49% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on November 15, 2011.
 
A Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)
is a DEPSC approved rate-mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in non-revenue producing capital improvements
to the water system between base rate proceedings. The following summarizes Tidewater’s approved DSIC rates from January
1, 2011 through November 15, 2011, when Tidewater’s DSIC was set to 0.0% in connection with the aforementioned 10.49% interim
rate increase:

    % Increase
    0.27%
    0.64%
    Cumulative %
    1.34%
    1.98%
 
In September 2009, the DEPSC approved an overall
14.95% or $3.0 million increase in Tidewater’s base rates. This rate increase approval is based on a 10.0% return on equity.
 
TESI – In July 2011,
TESI filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $0.8 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments TESI has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until mid 2012. In connection with the base rate increase request, TESI implemented a DEPSC
approved 7.6% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on September 28, 2011.

    Table of Contents
    
Southern Shores – Effective
June 1, 2011, the DEPSC approved a multi-year agreement for a phased-in base rate increase for Southern Shores.  This increase
was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of Southern Shores’ primary water treatment facilities,
as well as by increased operating costs.  Under the terms of the agreement, which expires on June 30, 2020, Southern Shores
also increased rates on January 1, 2012, and will do so on each successive January 1 st through 2015, to generate approximately
$0.1 million of additional revenue on an annual basis with each increase. Thereafter, rate increases, if any, cannot exceed the
lesser of the regional Consumer Price Index or 3%.
 
In accordance with the tariff established for
Southern Shores, an annual rate increase of 8.9% was implemented in January 2012.
 
Twin Lakes – In
December 2011, Twin Lakes and the interveners in the Twin Lakes Rate Case reached a settlement that provided a $0.1 million,
three-year phased-in base rate increase for Twin Lakes.  This increase was made as a result of capital investment in the
upgrade and renovation of the Twin Lakes System, as well as by increased operating costs.  The settlement was approved
by the PAPUC in March 2012.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
We have recorded certain costs as regulatory
assets because we expect full recovery of, or are currently recovering, these costs in the rates we charge customers. These deferred
costs have been excluded from rate base and, therefore, we are not earning a return on the unamortized balances. These items are
detailed as follows:

Postretirement benefits include pension and
other postretirement benefits that have been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with the guidance provided
in ASC 715 , Compensation – Retirement Benefits. These amounts represent obligations in excess of current funding,
which the Company believes will be fully recovered in rates set by the regulatory authorities.
 
The recovery period for income taxes is dependent
upon when the temporary differences between the tax and book treatment of various items reverse.
 
The Company uses composite depreciation rates
for its regulated utility assets, which is currently an acceptable method under generally accepted accounting principles and is
widely used in the utility industry. Historically, under the composite depreciation method, the anticipated costs of removing assets
upon retirement are provided for over the life of those assets as a component of depreciation expense. The Company recovers certain
asset retirement costs through rates charged to customers as an approved component of depreciation expense. As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the Company has approximately $8.0 and $7.4 million, respectively, of expected costs of removal recovered currently
in rates in excess of actual costs incurred. These amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities.
 
    46
    Table of Contents
    
The Company is recovering in current rates
acquisition premiums totaling $0.7 million over the remaining lives of the underlying Utility Plant. These deferred costs have
been included in rate base as utility plant and a return is being earned on the unamortized balances during the recovery periods.
The Company expects to recover training costs of approximately $0.8 million associated with implementation of a new information
technology system in future rates. These costs are included in General Utility Plant.

The statutory review periods for income tax returns for the
years prior to 2009 have been closed. An examination by the Internal Revenue Service of Middlesex’s Federal income tax returns
for 2007 and 2008 was completed during 2010 and resulted in a net refund, including interest, of less than $0.1 million. The refund
noted above was recorded to the appropriate current and deferred tax accounts and the interest was reported as other income. In
the event that there are interest and penalties associated with income tax adjustments in future examinations, these amounts will
be reported under interest expense and other expense, respectively. There are no unrecognized tax benefits resulting from prior
period tax positions. The Company is not aware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in a future tax liability.

Note 6 - Capitalization
 
All the transactions discussed below related
to the issuance of securities were approved by either the NJBPU or DEPSC, except where otherwise noted.
 
Common Stock
In June 2010, the Company sold and issued
1.9 million shares of common stock in a public offering that was priced at $15.21 per share. The net proceeds of approximately
$27.8 million were used to repay certain of the Company’s short-term debt outstanding.
 
The number of shares authorized under
the Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) is 2.3 million shares. The cumulative number of shares issued under
the DRP at December 31, 2011, is 2.0 million.
 
The Company issues shares under a restricted
stock plan for certain management employees, which is described in Note 7 – Employee Benefit Plans.
 
The Company maintains a stock plan for its
outside directors (the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan). In 2011, 3,833 shares of common stock were granted and issued
to the Company’s outside directors under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan and 93,197 shares remain available
for future awards. The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan is 100,000.
 
In the event dividends on the preferred
stock are in arrears, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company. At December 31, 2011, no preferred

    49
    Table of Contents
    
Preferred Stock
If four or more quarterly dividends are
in arrears, the preferred shareholders, as a class, are entitled to elect two members to the Board of Directors in addition to
Directors elected by holders of the common stock. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were less than 0.1 million shares of preferred
stock authorized and outstanding and there were no dividends in arrears.
 
The Company may not pay any dividends
on its common stock unless full cumulative dividends to the preceding dividend date for all outstanding shares of preferred stock
have been paid or set aside for payment. All such preferred dividends have been paid. In addition, if Middlesex were to liquidate,
holders of preferred stock would be paid back the stated value of their preferred shares before any distributions could be made
to common stockholders.
 
The conversion feature of the no par $7.00
Series Cumulative and Convertible Preferred Stock allows the security holders to exchange one convertible preferred share for twelve
shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the outstanding convertible stock in any
calendar year at a price equal to the fair market value of twelve shares of the Company's common stock for each share of convertible
stock redeemed. In February 2011, the Company repurchased 93 shares of its $7.00 Series, nonredeemable cumulative preferred stock
at par value for approximately $9 thousand.
 
The conversion feature of the no par $8.00
Series Cumulative and Convertible Preferred Stock allows the security holders to exchange one convertible preferred share for 13.714
shares of the Company's common stock. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock at the election of the security holder
or Middlesex.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were
used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,
accounts payable and notes payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt relating to First Mortgage and SRF bonds is based on quoted market prices
for similar issues. The carrying amount and fair value of the Company’s bonds were as follows:

    State Revolving Bonds  
    $ 793    
    $ 799    
    $ 919    
    $ 937  
 
For other long-term debt for which there was
no quoted market price, it was not practicable to estimate their fair value. The carrying amount of these instruments was $49.3
million and $48.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customer advances for construction have a carrying amount
of $21.9 million and $21.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Their relative fair values cannot be accurately
estimated since future refund payments depend on several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption levels
and future rate increases.
 
Note 7 - Employee Benefit Plans
 
Pension Benefits
The Company’s Pension Plan covers
substantially all active employees hired prior to March 31, 2007. Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate
in this plan, but can participate in a defined contribution plan that provides an annual contribution at the discretion of the
Company, based upon a percentage of the participants’ compensation. In order to be eligible for contribution, the eligible
employee must be employed by the Company on December 31 st of the year to which the award relates. In addition, the Company
maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers. The Accumulated Benefit Obligation for the Company’s
Pension Plan at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $46.5 million and $33.8 million, respectively.
 
Other Benefits
The Company’s Other Benefits Plan
covers substantially all of its retired employees. Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate in this
plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance. Accrued retirement benefit costs are recorded each year.
 
The Company has recognized a deferred
regulatory asset relating to the difference between the accrued retirement benefit costs and actual cash paid for plan premiums
in years prior to 1998. Included in the regulatory asset is a transition obligation from adopting Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No.106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,” on January 1, 1993.
In addition to the recognition of annual accrued retirement benefit costs in rates, Middlesex is also recovering the transition
obligation over 15 years. The regulatory asset related to this transition obligation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $0.1 million
and $0.2 million, respectively.

Regulatory Treatment of Over/Underfunded
Retirement Obligations
Because the Company is subject to regulation
in the states in which it operates, it is required to maintain its accounts in accordance with the regulatory authority’s
rules and guidelines, which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows
the guidance of ASC 980, Regulated Operations . Based on prior regulatory practice, and in accordance with the guidance in
ASC 980, Regulated Operations , the Company records underfunded Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan obligations, which otherwise
would be recognized as Other Comprehensive Income under  ASC 715, Compensation – Retirement Benefits , as a
Regulatory Asset, and expects to recover those costs in rates charged to customers.
 
The Company uses a December 31 measurement
date for all of its employee benefit plans. The table below sets forth information relating to the Company’s Pension Plan
and Other Benefits Plan for 2011 and 2010.

The compensation increase assumption for
the Other Benefits Plan is attributable to life insurance provided to qualifying employees upon their retirement. The insurance
coverage will be determined based on the employee’s base compensation as of their retirement date.
 
For the 2011 valuation, costs and
obligations for our Other Benefits Plan assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare
benefits in 2012 with a decline of 1.0% per year for 2013-2015 and 0.5% per year for 2016-2017, resulting in an annual rate
of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 5% by year 2017.

Two outside investment firms each manage
a portion of the Pension Plan asset portfolio. One of those investment firms also manages the Other Benefits Plan asset portfolio.
Quarterly meetings are held between the Company’s Pension Committee of the Board of Directors and the investment managers
to review their performance and asset allocation. If the actual asset allocation is outside the targeted range, the Pension Committee
reviews current market conditions and advice provided by the investment managers to determine the appropriateness of rebalancing
the portfolio.
 
The objective of the Company is to maximize
the long-term return on retirement plan assets, relative to a reasonable level of risk, maintain a diversified investment portfolio
and maintain compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The expected long-term rate of return is based
on the various asset categories in which plan assets are invested and the current expectations and historical performance for these
categories.
 
Equity securities include Middlesex common
stock in the amounts of $0.7 million (2.3% of total plan assets) and $0.7 million (2.4 % of total pension plan assets) at December
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements
Accounting guidance provides a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
 
     
    ·         
    Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical
assets or liabilities in accessible active markets.
     
    ·         
    Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. If the
asset or liability has a specified contractual term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability.
     
    ·         
    Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair
value measurement.
 
Certain investments in cash and cash equivalents,
equity securities, and commodities are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1 investments.
Certain investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities and fixed income securities are valued using prices received
from pricing vendors that utilize observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2 investments.

Benefit Plans Contributions
For the Pension Plan, Middlesex made total
cash contributions of $3.6 million in 2011 and expects to make cash contributions of approximately $4.1 million in 2012.
 
For the Other Benefits Plan, Middlesex made
total cash contributions of $3.3 million in 2011 and expects to make contributions of approximately $4.8 million in 2012.
 
401(k) Plan
The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution
plan, which covers substantially all employees with more than 1,000 hours of service. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company
matches 100% of a participant’s contributions, which do not exceed 1% of a participant’s compensation, plus 50% of
a participant’s contributions exceeding 1%, but not more than 6%. The Company’s matching contributions were $0.5 million
for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
 
For those employees hired after March
31, 2007 and still employed on December 31, 2011, the Company approved and will fund discretionary contribution of $0.2 million,
which was based on 5.0% of eligible 2011 compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company made discretionary
contributions of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for those employees hired after March 31, 2007.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has a stock compensation plan
for certain management employees (the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan). The Company maintains an escrow account for 0.1 million shares
of the Company's common stock for the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan. Such stock is subject to an agreement requiring forfeiture by
the employee in the event of termination of employment within five years of the award other than as a result of retirement, death,
disability or change in control. The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan is 0.3
million shares, for which 0.2 million remain as unissued shares.
 
The Company recognizes compensation expense at fair value for
the restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation . Compensation expense
is determined by the market value of the stock on the date of the award and is being amortized over a five-year period.

    Controls and Procedures
 
(1) Disclosure controls and procedures
are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
 
As
required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures was conducted by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer along with the Company’s
Chief Financial Officer for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. Based upon that evaluation the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and the Company’s Chief Financial Officer concluded: 
(a)
Disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
(b)
No changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly,
management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
(2) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting
 
The management of Middlesex Water Company (Middlesex
or the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13A-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Middlesex’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance
to the Company’s management and Board of Directors of adequate preparation and fair presentation of the published financial
statements.
 
All internal control systems, no matter how
well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to the adequacy of financial statement preparation and presentation. Middlesex’s management assessed
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework . Based on our assessment, we believe that as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is operating as designed and is effective based on those criteria.
 
Middlesex’s independent registered public
accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 as stated
in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered

Board of Directors and Stockholders
Middlesex Water Company
 
We have audited Middlesex Water Company’s
(the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). Middlesex Water Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
An entity’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, Middlesex Water Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
 
We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements
of capital stock and long-term debt and the related consolidated statements of income, common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows of Middlesex Water Company and our report dated March 8, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion.

CHANGE IN CONTROL TERMINATION AGREEMENT
 
 
This Change in Control Termination Agreement
(the “Agreement”) is entered into as of March 1, 2012, between Middlesex Water Company, a New Jersey corporation, with
its principal place of business located at 1500 Ronson Road, P.O. Box 1500, Iselin, New Jersey 08830-0452, (the “Company”),
and Lorrie Ginegaw, residing at 1808 Cypress Lane, East Brunswick, New Jersey 08816, (referred to as “You” in this
Agreement).
 
Recitals
 
A.	The Company considers it essential to the best interests of
its stockholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel. In this connection, the Board of Directors of
the Company (the “Board”) recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held Companies, the possibility of a Change
in Control may exist. This possibility, and the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management, may result in the
departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.
 
B.	The Board has determined that appropriate steps should be
taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company’s management, including
You, to the assigned duties without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility
of a Change in Control of the Company.
 
C.	To induce You to remain in the employ of the Company, and
in consideration of your agreement set forth below, the Company agrees that You shall receive the severance benefits set forth
in this Agreement in the event your employment with the Company is terminated by the Company, or is terminated by You for “Good
Reason” as defined herein in connection with a “Change in Control of the Company” (as defined in Section 2 below)
under the circumstances described below. This Agreement is meant to supersede any other specific written agreements that may have
been entered into between yourself and the Company concerning termination of employment.
 
Therefore, in consideration of your continued
employment and the parties’ agreement to be bound by the terms contained in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows:
 
1.        Term
of Agreement . This Agreement shall commence as of  March 1, 2012 and shall continue in effect through December
31, 2012. However, commencing on December 31, 2012, and each December 31 afterwards, the term of this Agreement shall
automatically be extended for one (1) additional year unless, no later than the preceding November 1st, the Company shall
have given notice that it does not wish to extend this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Change in Control of
the Company shall be proposed to occur or have occurred during the original or any extended term of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall continue in effect until your termination of employment with the Company or its successor or when all
amounts due under this Agreement following a termination have been paid, whichever is later.
    Page 1 of 11
     
    
 
2. Change In Control . No benefits
shall be payable under this Agreement unless there shall have been a Change in Control of the Company, as set forth herein. For
purposes of this Agreement, a “Change in Control” of the Company shall be deemed to occur if any party or group acquires
beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the voting shares of the Company; or if shareholder approval is obtained for a transaction
involving the acquisition of the Company through the purchase or exchange of the stock or assets of the Company by merger or otherwise;
or if one-third or more of the Board elected in a 12-month period or less are so elected without the approval of a majority of
the Board as constituted at the beginning of such period; or a liquidation or dissolution of Company.
 
3. Termination Following Change In Control .
If any of the events described in Section 2 above constituting a Change in Control of the Company shall have occurred, then unless
the termination is (A) because of your death, Disability or Retirement, (B) by the Company for Cause, or (C) by You other than
for Good Reason, on the subsequent termination of your employment during the term of this Agreement, You shall be entitled to the
severance benefits provided in Section 4.3 below if such termination occurs on or before the third (3 rd ) anniversary
of the Change in Control date .
 
3.1 Disability; Retirement . If,
as a result of your incapacity due to physical or mental illness, You shall have been absent from the full-time performance of
your duties with the Company for 6 consecutive months, and within 30 days after written notice of termination is given You shall
not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties, your employment may be terminated for "Disability." Termination
of your employment by the Company or You due to your "Retirement" shall mean termination in accordance with the Company's
retirement policy, including early retirement, generally applicable to its salaried employees or in accordance with any retirement
arrangement established with your consent with respect to You.
 
3.2 Cause . Termination by the Company
of your employment for "Cause" shall mean termination as a result of:
 
3.2.1 The willful and continued failure by You to substantially
perform your duties with the Company as such employment was performed by You prior to the Change in Control (other than any such
failure resulting from your Disability or any such actual or anticipated failure after the issuance by You of a Notice of Termination
for Good Reason as defined herein) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to You by the Board, which demand
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that You have not substantially performed your duties; or
 
    Page 2 of 11
     
    
3.2.2 The willful act by You in conduct that is demonstrably
and materially injurious to the Company, and which the Board deems to cause or will cause substantial economic damage to the Company
or injury to the business reputation of the Company, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this Section, no act, or failure
to act, on your part shall be deemed “willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by You not in good faith and without
a reasonable belief that your action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, You shall
not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to You a copy of a resolution
duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the
Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to You and an opportunity for You, together with your counsel,
to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board You were guilty of conduct set forth above in
clauses 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 of this Section and specifying the particulars in detail.
 
3.3 Good Reason . You shall be entitled
to receive severance benefits as provided in this Agreement if You terminate your employment with the Company for “Good Reason.”
For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean, without your consent, the occurrence in connection with a Change
in Control of the Company of any of the following circumstances unless, in the case of Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.5, 3.3.6, 3.3.7, or
3.3.8, the circumstances are fully corrected prior to the Date of Termination specified in the Notice of Termination, as defined
in Sections 3.5 and 3.4, respectively, given in respect of them. If You terminate your employment with the Company for Good Reason,
as provided below, your employment with the Company shall be considered to have been involuntarily terminated by the Company:
 
3.3.1 The assignment to You of any significant employment
duties which are inconsistent with your status and position (i) prior to the Change in Control where such change is a direct result
of any pending Change in Control; or (ii) as such status exists immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company, or (iii)
which are a substantial adverse alteration in the nature or status of your responsibilities from those in effect immediately prior
to the Change in Control of the Company whichever is applicable;
    Page 3 of 11
     
    
 
 
3.3.2 A reduction by the Company in your annual base
salary as in effect on the initial date of this Agreement, or as same may be increased from time to time irrespective of future
Company policies including any across-the-board salary reductions similarly affecting all key employees of the Company;
 
3.3.3 Your relocation, without your consent, to an
employment location not within twenty-five (25) miles of your present office or job location, except for required travel on the
Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with your present business travel obligations;
 
3.3.4 The failure by the Company, without your consent,
to pay to You any part of your current compensation, or to pay to You any part of an installment of deferred compensation under
any deferred compensation program of the Company, within fourteen (14) days of the date the compensation is due;
 
3.3.5 The failure by the Company to continue in effect
any bonus to which You were entitled, or any compensation plan in which You participate (i) prior to the Change in Control where
such change is a direct result of any pending Change in Control, or (ii) immediately prior to the Change in Control of the Company
that is material to your total compensation, including but not limited to the Company's Restricted Stock Plan, 401(k) Plan, and
Benefit Plans, or any substitute plans adopted prior to the Change in Control of the Company, unless an equitable arrangement (embodied
in an ongoing substitute or alternative plan) has been made with respect to the plan, or the failure by the Company to continue
your participation in it (or in such substitute or alternative plan) on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of
the amount of benefits provided and the level of your participation relative to other participants, as existed at the time of the
Change in Control;
 
3.3.6 The failure by the Company to continue to provide
You with (i) benefits substantially similar to those enjoyed by You under any of the Company's life insurance, medical, health
and accident, or disability plans in which You were participating at the time of the Change in Control of the Company was in effect
for the employees of the Company generally at the time of the Change in Control, (ii) the failure to continue to provide You with
a Company automobile or allowance in lieu of it at the time of the Change in Control of the Company, (iii) the taking of any action
by the Company that would directly or indirectly materially reduce any of such benefits or deprive You of any material fringe benefit
enjoyed by You at the time of the Change in Control of the Company, or (iv) the failure by the Company to provide You with the
number of paid vacation days to which You are entitled on the basis of years of service with the Company in accordance with the
Company's normal vacation policy in effect at the time of the Change in Control of the Company;
    Page 4 of 11
     
    
 
 
3.3.7 The failure of the Company to obtain a satisfactory
agreement from any successor to assume and agree to perform this Agreement, as contemplated in Section 5 of this Agreement; or
 
3.3.8 Any purported termination of your employment
that is not effected pursuant to a Notice of Termination satisfying the requirements of Section 3.4 below (and, if applicable,
the requirements of Section 3.2 above); for purposes of this Agreement, no such purported termination shall be effective.
 
3.4 Notice of Termination . Any purported
termination of your employment by the Company or by You shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the other party
to this Agreement in accordance with Section 6 of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Notice of Termination"
shall mean a notice that shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied on, and shall set forth in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment under the provision
so indicated. Your rights to terminate your employment pursuant to this Section shall not be affected by your incapacity due to
Disability. Your continued employment shall not constitute consent to, or a waiver of rights with respect to, any circumstance
constituting Good Reason under this Agreement. In the event You deliver Notice of Termination based on circumstances set forth
in Sections 3.3.1, 3.3.5, 3.3.6, 3.3.7, or 3.3.8 above, which are fully corrected prior to the Date of Termination set forth in
your Notice of Termination, the Notice of Termination shall be deemed withdrawn and of no further force or effect.
 
3.5 Date of Termination, etc . "Date
of Termination" shall mean (A) if your employment is terminated for Disability, 30 days after Notice of Termination is given
(provided that You shall not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such 30-day period), and (B) if your
employment is terminated pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.3 above or for any other reason (other than Disability), the date specified
in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 3.2 above shall not be less than 30 days,
and in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 3.3 above shall not be less than 15 nor more than 60 days, respectively, from
the date the Notice of Termination is given). However, if within 15 days after any Notice of Termination is given, or, if later,
prior to the Date of Termination (as determined without regard to this provision), the party receiving the Notice of Termination
notifies the other party that a dispute exists concerning the termination, then the Date of Termination shall be the date on which
the dispute is finally determined, either by mutual written agreement of the parties, by a binding arbitration award, or by a final
judgment, order, or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the time for
appeal has expired and no appeal has been perfected). The Date of Termination shall be extended by a notice of dispute only if
the notice is given in good faith and the party giving the notice pursues the resolution of the dispute with reasonable diligence.
Notwithstanding the pendency of any such dispute, the Company will continue to pay You your full compensation in effect when the
notice giving rise to the dispute was given (including, but not limited to, base salary) and continue You as a participant in all
compensation, benefit, and insurance plans in which You were participating when the notice giving rise to the dispute was given,
until the dispute is finally resolved in accordance with this Section. Amounts paid under this Section are in addition to all other
amounts due under this Agreement and shall not be offset against or reduce any other amounts due under this Agreement.

4. Compensation on Termination or During
Disability . Following a Change in Control of the Company, as defined by Section 2, on termination of your employment or
during a period of Disability You shall be entitled to the following benefits:
 
4.1 During any period that You fail to
perform your full-time duties with the Company as a result of incapacity due to Disability, You shall continue to receive your
base salary at the rate in effect at the commencement of any such period, together with all amounts payable to You under any compensation
plan of the Company during the period, until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to section 3.1 above. Thereafter, or in the
event your employment shall be terminated by the Company or by You for Retirement, or by reason of your death, your benefits shall
be determined under the Company's retirement, insurance, and other compensation programs then in effect in accordance with the
terms of those programs.
 
4.2 If your employment shall be terminated by
the Company for Cause or by You other than for Good Reason, Disability, death, or Retirement, the Company shall pay You your full
base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts
and benefits to which You are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company at the time the payments are due. The Company
shall have no obligations to You under this Agreement.
 
4.3 On or before the third anniversary of the
Change in Control, if your employment by the Company shall be terminated (a) by the Company other than for Cause, Retirement or
Disability, or (b) by You for Good Reason (as defined in Section 3.3 herein), then You shall be entitled to the benefits provided
below:
 
    Page 6 of 11
     
    
4.3.1 The Company shall pay You your full salary through
the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the time Notice of Termination is given, plus all other amounts and benefits to
which You are entitled under any compensation plan of the Company, at the time the payments are due, except as otherwise provided
below.
 
4.3.2 In lieu of any further salary payments to You
for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay to You, as severance pay the following: (i) a lump sum
severance payment equal to three (3) times the average of your Compensation for the five (5) years prior to the occurrence of the
circumstance giving rise to the Notice of Termination (or if employed less than 5 years, the average annualized compensation of
the period worked to date), plus (ii) the amounts in the forms set forth in paragraphs 4.3.3, 4.3.4 and 4.3.5 (the “Severance
Payments”). In addition to the Severance Payments, the Company shall pay to You an additional amount equal to the amount
of the Excise Tax, if any, that is due or determined to be due under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
resulting from the Severance Payments or any other payments under this Agreement or any other agreement between You and the Company
and an amount sufficient to pay the taxes on any such Excise Taxes (the “Gross-up”).
 
4.3.3 The Company shall continue coverage for You
and your dependents under any health or welfare benefit plan under which You and your dependents were participating prior to the
Change in Control for a period ending on the earlier to occur of (i) the date You become covered by a new employer’s
health and welfare benefit plan, (ii) the date You become covered by Medicare, or (iii) the date which is thirty-six (36) months
from the Date of Termination. The coverage for your dependents shall end earlier than (i), (ii) or (iii) if required by the health
or welfare benefit plan due to age eligibility.
 
4.3.4 The Company shall pay to You any deferred compensation,
including, but not limited to deferred bonuses, allocated or credited to You or your account as of the Date of Termination.
 
4.3.5 Outstanding stock options or Restricted Stock
grants, if any, granted to You under the Company's Stock Plans which are not vested on Termination shall immediately vest.
    Page 7 of 11
     
    
 
 
4.3.6 Where You shall prevail in any action against
the Company to recover benefits hereunder, the Company shall also pay to You all reasonable legal and accounting fees and expenses
incurred by You as a result of the termination, including all such fees and expenses incurred by You as a result of the termination,
(including all such fees and expenses, if any, incurred in contesting or disputing any termination or in seeking to obtain or enforce
any right or benefit provided by this Agreement or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to
the application of Code Section 4999 to any payment or benefit provided under this Agreement) or any other agreement with the Company.
 
4.3.7 The amount of Severance Payments and any Gross-up
due to You under this or any other relevant agreement with the Company shall be determined by a third party agreed to by You and
the Company. If You cannot agree on a third party, then both third parties shall determine the amounts due under this Agreement.
If the third parties do not agree on the amount to be paid to You, then either party may submit the calculation of the amounts
which are in dispute to Arbitration in accordance with this Agreement. The payments provided for in Paragraphs 4.3.2, 4.3.4 and
4.3.5 above, shall be made no later than the thirtieth (30 th ) day following the Date of Termination. However, if the
amounts of the payments cannot be finally determined on or before that day, the Company shall pay to You on that day an estimate,
as determined in good faith by the Company, of the minimum amount of such payments and shall pay the remainder of those payments
(together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code) as soon as the amount can be determined but
in no event later than the 30th day after the Date of Termination. In the event that the amount of the estimated payments exceeds
the amount subsequently determined to have been due, the excess shall constitute a loan by the Company to You payable on the 30th
day after demand by the Company (together with interest at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code).
 
4.4 For purposes
of this Agreement, “Compensation” shall mean the gross earnings reported on Form W-2 during a calendar year (which
may include but is not limited to the value of the personal use of an automobile, any third-party sick pay, and any fees paid to
You for serving as a Director of the Company or its subsidiaries); awards under the Company’s Restricted Stock Plan or other
equity awards; and Company contributions to your 401(k) account.
 
4.5 You shall not be required to mitigate
the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any
payment or benefit provided for in this Section 4 be reduced by any compensation earned by You as the result of employment by another
employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by You to the Company, or otherwise except as
specifically provided in this Section 4.
    Page 8 of 11
     
    
 
4.6 In addition to all other amounts payable
to You under this Section 4, You shall be entitled to receive all qualified benefits payable to You under the Company's 401(k)
Plan, Defined Benefit Plan and any other plan or agreement relating to retirement benefits in accordance with the terms of those
plans.
 
5. Successors; Binding Agreement .
 
5.1 The Company will require any successor
(whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or
assets of the Company to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the
Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain the assumption
and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle You to compensation
from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as You would have been entitled to under this Agreement if You had terminated
your employment for Good Reason following a Change in Control of the Company, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing,
the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination.
 
5.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, and legatees.
If You should die while any amount would still be payable to You if You had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise
provided in this Agreement, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your legatee or other designee or,
if there is no such designee, to your estate.
 
6. Notice . For the purpose of
this Agreement, all notices and other communications provided for in the Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed to the respective addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement, provided that all notices to the Company shall
be directed to the attention of the Board with a copy to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other address as either party
may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance this Agreement, except that notice of a change of address shall be effective
only on receipt.

7. Miscellaneous
 
7.1 No provision of this Agreement may
be modified, waived, or discharged unless the waiver, modification, or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by You and
such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board.
 
7.2 No waiver by either party to this Agreement
at any time of any breach by the other party of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed
by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent
time.
 
7.3 No agreements or representations, oral
or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement have been made by either party that are

Amended and

Committed Line Of Credit Note
(Multi-Rate Options)
    $20,000,000.00
    January 29, 2010
 
FOR VALUE RECEIVED , MIDDLESEX
WATER COMPANY (the “Borrower” ), with an address at 1500 Ronson Road, Iselin, New Jersey 08830-3020, promises
to pay to the order of PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (the “Bank” ), in lawful money of the United
States of America in immediately available funds at its offices located at Two Tower Center Boulevard, East Brunswick, New Jersey
08816, or at such other location as the Bank may designate from time to time, the principal sum of TWENTY MILLION AND 00/100
DOLLARS ($20,000,000.00) (the “Facility” ) or such lesser amount as may be advanced to or for the benefit
of the Borrower hereunder, together with interest accruing on the outstanding principal balance from the date hereof, all as provided
below.
 
1.	 Advances . The
Borrower may request advances, repay and request additional advances hereunder until the Expiration Date, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Note and the Loan Documents (as hereinafter defined). The “Expiration Date” shall mean
January 29, 2011, or such later date as may be designated by the Bank by written notice from the Bank to the Borrower. The Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that in no event will the Bank be under any obligation to extend or renew the Facility or this Note beyond
the Expiration Date. The Borrower may request advances hereunder upon giving oral or written notice to the Bank by 11:00 a.m. (Eastern,
Standard time) (a) on the day of the proposed advance, in the case of advances to bear interest under the Base Rate Option (as
hereinafter defined) and (b) three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed advance, in the case of advances to bear interest
under the LIBOR Option (as hereinafter defined), followed promptly thereafter by the Borrower’s written confirmation to the
Bank of any oral notice. The aggregate unpaid principal amount of advances under this Note shall not exceed the face amount of
this Note.
 
2.	 Rate of Interest .
Each advance outstanding under this Note will bear interest at a rate or rates per annum as may be selected by the Borrower from
the interest rate options set forth below (each, an “ Option ”):
 
(i)	
Base Rate Option . A rate of interest per annum which is at all times equal to the Base Rate. If and when the Base
Rate (or any component thereof) changes, the rate of interest with respect to any advance to which the Base Rate Option applies
will change automatically without notice to the Borrower, effective on the date of any such change. There are no required minimum
interest periods for advances bearing interest under the Base Rate Option.
 
(ii)	 LIBOR
Option . A rate per annum equal to (A) LIBOR plus (B) one hundred (100) basis points (1.00%), for the applicable
LIBOR Interest Period.
 
     
     
    
For purposes hereof, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:
 
“ Base Rate ”
shall mean the highest of (A) the Prime Rate, and (B) the sum of the Federal Funds Open Rate plus fifty (50) basis points
(0.50%), and (C) the sum of the Daily LIBOR Rate plus one hundred (100) basis points (1.0%), so long as a Daily LIBOR Rate
is offered, ascertainable and not unlawful.
 
“ Business Day ”
shall mean any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a legal holiday on which commercial banks are authorized or required by law
to be closed for business in East Brunswick, New Jersey.
 
“ Daily LIBOR Rate ”
shall mean, for any day, the rate per annum determined by the Bank by dividing (x) the Published Rate by (y) a number equal to
1.00 minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage.
 
“Federal Funds Open
Rate” shall mean, for any day, the rate per annum (based on a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) which
is the daily federal funds open rate as quoted by ICAP North America, Inc. (or any successor) as set forth on the Bloomberg Screen
BTMM for that day opposite the caption “OPEN” (or on such other substitute Bloomberg Screen that displays such rate),
or as set forth on such other recognized electronic source used for the purpose of displaying such rate as selected by the Bank
(an “Alternate Source”) (or if such rate for such day does not appear on the Bloomberg Screen BTMM (or any substitute
screen) or on any Alternate Source, or if there shall at any time, for any reason, no longer exist a Bloomberg Screen BTMM (or
any substitute screen) or any Alternate Source, a comparable replacement rate determined by the Bank at such time (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error); provided however, that if such day is not a Business Day, the Federal Funds Open Rate
for such day shall be the “open” rate on the immediately preceding Business Day. The rate of interest charged shall
be adjusted as of each Business Day based on changes in the Federal Funds Open Rate without notice to the Borrower.
 
“ LIBOR ”
shall mean, with respect to any advance to which the LIBOR Option applies for the applicable LIBOR Interest Period, the interest
rate per annum determined by the Bank by dividing (the resulting quotient rounded upwards, at the Bank’s discretion, to the
nearest 1/100th of 1%) (i) the rate of interest determined by the Bank in accordance with its usual procedures (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) to be the eurodollar rate two (2) Business Days prior to the first day of such LIBOR
Interest Period for an amount comparable to such advance and having a borrowing date and a maturity comparable to such LIBOR Interest
Period by (ii) a number equal to 1.00 minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage.
 
     
     
    
“ LIBOR Interest Period ”
shall mean, as to any advance to which the LIBOR Option applies, the period of one (1), two (2), or three (3) months as selected
by the Borrower in its notice of borrowing or notice of conversion, as the case may be, commencing on the date of disbursement
of an advance (or the date of conversion of an advance to the LIBOR Option, as the case may be) and each successive period selected
by the Borrower thereafter; provided that, (i) if a LIBOR Interest Period would end on a day which is not a Business
Day, it shall end on the next succeeding Business Day unless such day falls in the next succeeding calendar month in which case
the LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day, (ii) the Borrower may not select a LIBOR Interest Period
that would end on a day after the Expiration Date, and (iii) any LIBOR Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of
a calendar month (or a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the last calendar month of such LIBOR Interest
Period) shall end on the last Business Day of the last calendar month of such LIBOR Interest Period.
 
“ LIBOR Reserve Percentage ”
shall mean the maximum effective percentage in effect on such day as prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (or any successor) for determining the reserve requirements (including, without limitation, supplemental, marginal and emergency
reserve requirements) with respect to eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as “Eurocurrency liabilities”).
 
“Prime Rate”
shall mean the rate publicly announced by the Bank from time to time as its prime rate. The Prime Rate is determined from time
to time by the Bank as a means of pricing some loans to its borrowers. The Prime Rate is not tied to any external rate of interest
or index, and does not necessarily reflect the lowest rate of interest actually charged by the Bank to any particular class or
category of customers.
 
“ Published Rate ”
shall mean the rate of interest published each Business Day in the Wall Street Journal “Money Rates” listing under
the caption “London Interbank Offered Rates” for a one month period (or, if no such rate is published therein for any
reason, then the Published Rate shall be the eurodollar rate for a one month period as published in another publication selected
by the Bank).
 
LIBOR and the Daily LIBOR Rate shall
be adjusted with respect to any advance to which the LIBOR Option or Base Rate Option applies, as applicable, on and as of the
effective date of any change in the LIBOR Reserve Percentage. The Bank shall give prompt notice to the Borrower of LIBOR or the
Daily LIBOR Rate as determined or adjusted in accordance herewith, which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
 
If the Bank determines (which determination
shall be final and conclusive) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the eurodollar market generally, deposits in dollars
(in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to banks in the eurodollar market for the selected term, or adequate means do
not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then the Bank shall give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Bank notifies
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (a) the availability of the LIBOR Option shall
be suspended, and (b) the interest rate for all advances then bearing interest under the LIBOR Option shall be converted at the
expiration of the then current LIBOR Interest Period(s) to the Base Rate Option.
 
     
     
    
In addition, if, after the date
of this Note, the Bank shall determine (which determination shall be final and conclusive) that any enactment, promulgation or
adoption of or any change in any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof
by a governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by the Bank with any guideline, request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank
or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Bank to make or maintain or fund loans based on LIBOR, the Bank
shall notify the Borrower. Upon receipt of such notice, until the Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise
to such determination no longer apply, (a) the availability of the LIBOR Option shall be suspended, and (b) the interest rate on
all advances then bearing interest under the LIBOR Option shall be converted to the Base Rate Option either (i) on the last day
of the then current LIBOR Interest Period(s) if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain advances based on LIBOR to such day,
or (ii) immediately if the Bank may not lawfully continue to maintain advances based on LIBOR.
 
The foregoing notwithstanding, it
is understood that the Borrower may select different Options to apply simultaneously to different portions of the advances and
may select up to three (3) different interest periods to apply simultaneously to different portions of the advances bearing interest
under the LIBOR Option. Interest hereunder will be calculated based on the actual number of days that principal is outstanding
over a year of 360 days. In no event will the rate of interest hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowed by law.
 
3.	 Interest Rate Election .
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Note, at the end of each interest period applicable to any advance, the Borrower may
renew the Option applicable to such advance or convert such advance to a different Option; provided that , during
any period in which any Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) has occurred and is continuing, any advances bearing interest
under the LIBOR Option shall, at the Bank’s sole discretion, be converted at the end of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period
to the Base Rate Option and the LIBOR Option will not be available to Borrower with respect to any new advances (or with respect
to the conversion or renewal of any existing advances) until such Event of Default has been cured by the Borrower or waived by
the Bank. The Borrower shall notify the Bank of each election of an Option, each conversion from one Option to another, the amount
of the advances then outstanding to be allocated to each Option and where relevant the interest periods therefor. In the case of
converting to the LIBOR Option, such notice shall be given at least three (3) Business Days prior to the commencement of any LIBOR
Interest Period. If no interest period is specified in any such notice for which the resulting advance is to bear interest under
the LIBOR Option, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected a LIBOR Interest Period of one month’s duration. If no notice
of election, conversion or renewal is timely received by the Bank with respect to any advance, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have elected the Base Rate Option. Any such election shall be promptly confirmed in writing by such method as the Bank may require.
 
     
     
    
4.	 Advance Procedures .
A request for advance made by telephone must be promptly confirmed in writing by such method as the Bank may require. The Borrower
authorizes the Bank to accept telephonic requests for advances, and the Bank shall be entitled to rely upon the authority of any
person providing such instructions. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds the Bank harmless from and against any and all damages,
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) which may arise or be created
by the acceptance of such telephone requests or making such advances. The Bank will enter on its books and records, which entry
when made will be presumed correct, the date and amount of each advance, the interest rate and interest period applicable thereto,
as well as the date and amount of each payment.
 
5.  	 Payment
Terms . The Borrower shall pay accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance of this Note in arrears: (a) for the portion
of advances bearing interest under the Base Rate Option, on the first day of each month during the term hereof, (b) for the portion
of advances bearing interest under the LIBOR Option, on the last day of the respective LIBOR Interest Period, as the case may be,
for such advance, and (c) for all advances, at maturity, whether by acceleration of this Note or otherwise, and after maturity,
on demand until paid in full. All outstanding principal and accrued interest hereunder shall be due and payable in full on the
Expiration Date.
 
If any payment under this Note shall
become due on a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday under the laws of the State where the Bank’s office indicated above is
located, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Bank to charge the Borrower’s deposit account
at the Bank for any payment when due hereunder. Payments received will be applied to charges, fees and expenses (including attorneys’
fees), accrued interest and principal in any order the Bank may choose, in its sole discretion.
 
6.	 Late Payments; Default
Rate . If the Borrower fails to make any payment of principal, interest or other amount coming due pursuant to the provisions
of this Note within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date due and payable, the Borrower also shall pay to the Bank a late charge
equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of the amount of such payment or $100.00 (the “Late Charge” ). Such
fifteen (15) day period shall not be construed in any way to extend the due date of any such payment. Upon maturity, whether by
acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at the Bank’s option upon the occurrence of any Event of Default (as hereinafter defined)
and during the continuance thereof, each advance outstanding under this Note shall bear interest at a rate per annum (based on
the actual number of days that principal is outstanding over a year of 360 days) which shall be three percentage points (3%)
in excess of the interest rate in effect from time to time under this Note but not more than the maximum rate allowed by law (the
“Default Rate” ). The Default Rate shall continue to apply whether or not judgment shall be entered on this Note.
Both the Late Charge and the Default Rate are imposed as liquidated damages for the purpose of defraying the Bank’s expenses
incident to the handling of delinquent payments, but are in addition to, and not in lieu of, the Bank’s exercise of any rights
and remedies hereunder, under the other Loan Documents or under applicable law, and any fees and expenses of any agents or attorneys
which the Bank may employ. In addition, the Default Rate reflects the increased credit risk to the Bank of carrying a loan that
is in default. The Borrower agrees that the Late Charge and Default Rate are reasonable forecasts of just compensation for anticipated
and actual harm incurred by the Bank, and that the actual harm incurred by the Bank cannot be estimated with certainty and without
difficulty.
 
     
     
    
7.	 Prepayment .
The Borrower shall have the right to prepay any advance hereunder at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part; subject,
however, to payment of any break funding indemnification amounts owing pursuant to paragraph 8 below.
 
8.	 Yield Protection; Break
Funding Indemnification . The Borrower shall pay to the Bank on written demand therefor, together with the written evidence
of the justification therefor, all direct costs incurred, losses suffered or payments made by Bank by reason of any change in law
or regulation or its interpretation imposing any reserve, deposit, allocation of capital, or similar requirement (including without
limitation, Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) on the Bank, its holding company or any of their
respective assets. In addition, the Borrower agrees to indemnify the Bank against any liabilities, losses or expenses (including,
without limitation, loss of margin, any loss or expense sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties,
and any loss or expense incurred in connection with funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any advance (or any part thereof)
bearing interest under the LIBOR Option) which the Bank sustains or incurs as a consequence of either (i) the Borrower’s
failure to make a payment on the due date thereof, (ii) the Borrower’s revocation (expressly, by later inconsistent notices
or otherwise) in whole or in part of any notice given to Bank to request, convert, renew or prepay any advance bearing interest
under the LIBOR Option, or (iii) the Borrower’s payment or prepayment (whether voluntary, after acceleration of the maturity
of this Note or otherwise) or conversion of any advance bearing interest under the LIBOR Option on a day other than the last day
of the applicable LIBOR Interest Period. A notice as to any amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph given to the Borrower by
the Bank shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and shall be payable upon demand. The Borrower’s indemnification
obligations hereunder shall survive the payment in full of the advances and all other amounts payable hereunder.
 
9.	 Other Loan Documents .
 This Note is issued in connection with a Letter Agreement dated August 27, 2001 between the Borrower and the Bank, dated on
or before the date hereof, and the other agreements and documents executed and/or delivered in connection therewith or referred
to therein, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference (as amended, modified or renewed from time to time, collectively
the “Loan Documents” ), and is secured by the property (if any) described in the Loan Documents and by such other
collateral as previously may have been or may in the future be granted to the Bank to secure this Note. 
 
10.	 Events of Default .
The occurrence of any of the following events will be deemed to be an “Event of Default” under this Note: (i)
the nonpayment of any principal, interest or other indebtedness under this Note when due; (ii) the occurrence of any event of default
or any default and the lapse of any notice or cure period, or any Obligor’s failure to observe or perform any covenant or
other agreement, under or contained in any Loan Document or any other document now or in the future evidencing or securing any
debt, liability or obligation of any Obligor to the Bank; (iii) the filing by or against any Obligor of any proceeding in bankruptcy,
receivership, insolvency, reorganization, liquidation, conservatorship or similar proceeding (and, in the case of any such proceeding
instituted against any Obligor, such proceeding is not dismissed or stayed within 30 days of the commencement thereof, provided
that the Bank shall not be obligated to advance additional funds hereunder during such period); (iv) any assignment by any Obligor
for the benefit of creditors, or any levy, garnishment, attachment or similar proceeding is instituted against any property of
any Obligor held by or deposited with the Bank; (v) a default with respect to any other indebtedness of any Obligor for borrowed
money, if the effect of such default is to cause or permit the acceleration of such debt; (vi) the commencement of any foreclosure
or forfeiture proceeding, execution or attachment against any collateral securing the obligations of any Obligor to the Bank; (vii)
the entry of a final judgment against any Obligor and the failure of such Obligor to discharge the judgment within ten (10) days
of the entry thereof; (viii) any material adverse change in any Obligor’s business, assets, operations, financial condition
or results of operations; (ix) any Obligor ceases doing business as a going concern; (x) any representation or warranty made by
any Obligor to the Bank in any Loan Document or any other documents now or in the future evidencing or securing the obligations
of any Obligor to the Bank, is false, erroneous or misleading in any material respect; (xi) if this Note or any guarantee executed
by any Obligor is secured, the failure of any Obligor to provide the Bank with additional collateral if in the Bank’s opinion
at any time or times, the market value of any of the collateral securing this Note or any guarantee has depreciated below that
required pursuant to the Loan Documents or, if no specific value is so required, then in an amount deemed material by the Bank;
(xii) the revocation or attempted revocation, in whole or in part, of any guarantee by any Obligor; or (xiii) the death, incarceration,
indictment or legal incompetency of any individual Obligor or, if any Obligor is a partnership or limited liability company, the
death, incarceration, indictment or legal incompetency of any individual general partner or member. As used herein, the term “Obligor”
means any Borrower and any guarantor of, or any pledgor, mortgagor or other person or entity providing collateral support for,
the Borrower’s obligations to the Bank existing on the date of this Note or arising in the future.
 
     
     
    
Upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default: (a) the Bank shall be under no further obligation to make advances hereunder; (b) if an Event of Default specified
in clause (iii) or (iv) above shall occur, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest hereunder together with any additional
amounts payable hereunder shall be immediately due and payable without demand or notice of any kind; (c) if any other Event
of Default shall occur, the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest hereunder together with any additional amounts payable
hereunder, at the Bank’s option and without demand or notice of any kind, may be accelerated and become immediately due and
payable; (d) at the Bank’s option, this Note will bear interest at the Default Rate from the date of the occurrence
of the Event of Default; and (e) the Bank may exercise from time to time any of the rights and remedies available under the
Loan Documents or under applicable law.
 
11.	 Right of Setoff .
In addition to all liens upon and rights of setoff against the Borrower’s money, securities or other property given to the
Bank by law, the Bank shall have, with respect to the Borrower’s obligations to the Bank under this Note and to the extent
permitted by law, a contractual possessory security interest in and a contractual right of setoff against, and the Borrower hereby
grants the Bank a security interest in, and hereby assigns, conveys, delivers, pledges and transfers to the Bank, all of the Borrower’s
right, title and interest in and to, all of the Borrower’s deposits, moneys, securities and other property now or hereafter
in the possession of or on deposit with, or in transit to, the Bank or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., whether held in a general or special account or deposit, whether held jointly with someone else, or whether
held for safekeeping or otherwise, excluding, however, all IRA, Keogh, and trust accounts. Every such security interest and right
of setoff may be exercised without demand upon or notice to the Borrower. Every such right of setoff shall be deemed to have been
exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default hereunder without any action of the Bank, although the Bank may
enter such setoff on its books and records at a later time.
 
12.	 Indemnity .
The Borrower agrees to indemnify each of the Bank, each legal entity, if any, who controls, is controlled by or is under common
control with the Bank, and each of their respective directors, officers and employees (the “Indemnified Parties” ),
and to defend and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses
(including all fees and charges of internal or external counsel with whom any Indemnified Party may consult and all expenses of
litigation and preparation therefor) which any Indemnified Party may incur or which may be asserted against any Indemnified Party
by any person, entity or governmental authority (including any person or entity claiming derivatively on behalf of the Borrower),
in connection with or arising out of or relating to the matters referred to in this Note or in the other Loan Documents or the
use of any advance hereunder, whether (a) arising from or incurred in connection with any breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant by the Borrower, or (b) arising out of or resulting from any suit, action, claim, proceeding or governmental investigation,
pending or threatened, whether based on statute, regulation or order, or tort, or contract or otherwise, before any court or governmental
authority; provided , however , that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not apply to any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses solely attributable to an Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The indemnity agreement
contained in this Section shall survive the termination of this Note, payment of any advance hereunder and the assignment of any
rights hereunder. The Borrower may participate at its expense in the defense of any such action or claim.
 
     
     
    
13.	 Miscellaneous.

Notices may be given in any manner to which the parties may separately agree, including electronic mail. Without limiting the foregoing,
first-class mail, facsimile transmission and commercial courier service are hereby agreed to as acceptable methods for giving Notices.
Regardless of the manner in which provided, Notices may be sent to a party’s address as set forth above or to such other
address as any party may give to the other for such purpose in accordance with this paragraph. No delay or omission on the Bank’s

hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies which the Bank may have under other agreements, at law
or in equity. No modification, amendment or waiver of, or consent to any departure by the Borrower from, any provision of this

illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court, all the other provisions of this Note will remain in full force and effect.
The Borrower and all other makers and indorsers of this Note hereby forever waive presentment, protest, notice of dishonor and
notice of non-payment. The Borrower also waives all defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral. If this Note is executed

the Loan Documents, if any, through but not including the date of the execution and de livery of this letter and the extension

construed as a waiver of any other provision of the Loan Documents or any other document executed in connection with the Loan Documents
or a waiver of any presently existing or future default in the non-payment of principal and/or interest or any other amounts due
under the Loan Documents.
The
Borrower hereby warrants and represents that the representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents continue to be
true and correct and that no event of default, and no event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become
an event of default, has occurred or is continuing under the Loan Documents. The Borrower acknowledges that as of the date hereof
there are no offsets, defenses, claims, counterclaims, charges or deductions of any nature against amounts due and owing under
the Note or against the Bank or any of its officers, directors or employers.

MASTER
PROMISSORY NOTE
    $25,000,000
    February 2, 2009
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned ,
MIDDLESEX WATER COMPANY , a New Jersey corporation (the “ Borrower ”), hereby
promises to pay to the order of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (the “ Lender ”), at its office at 750 Walnut
Avenue, Cranford, New Jersey 07016 (or at such other place as the Lender may designate from time to time), in lawful money of the
United States of America and in immediately available funds, the principal amount of Twenty Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000)
or such lesser amount as shall equal the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the advances (the “ Loans ”) made
by the Lender to the Borrower under this Master Promissory Note (this “ Note ”), and to pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each such Loan at the rates per annum and on the dates specified below.
Each Loan hereunder shall be at the
sole discretion of the Lender. Each Loan shall have a maturity date and shall bear interest at the rate per annum quoted to the
Borrower by the Lender and accepted by the Borrower prior to the making of such Loan (which acceptance shall in any event be deemed
to occur upon receipt by the Borrower of the proceeds of any Loan). Each Loan, and accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be
due and payable, on the earlier of (a) the maturity date of such Loan, or (b) May 30, 2010 (“Maturity Date”). No Loan
shall have a maturity of more than ninety (90) days or three months (whichever is longer) after the
date made. No Lo an shall have a maturity beyond the Maturity Date. The Lender may, if and to the extent any payment is not
made when due hereunder, charge from time to time against any or all of the Borrower’s accounts with the Lender any amount
so due.
The date, amount, interest rate,
and maturity date of each Loan, and each payment of principal and interest hereon, shall be recorded by the Lender on its books,
which recordations shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as to such matters; provided that the failure
of the Lender to make any such recordation or any error therein shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower
hereunder.
The Borrower may not prepay any Loan
in whole or in part without the Lender’s prior written consent; provided , however , that if any such prepayment
is made the Borrower shall at the time of prepayment compensate the Lender for any loss, cost, or expense that the Lender incurs
as a result of such prepayment. In addition, the Borrower shall compensate the Lender for any loss, cost or expense that the Lender
incurs as a result of a prepayment by reason of acceleration of the indebtedness hereunder.
Interest shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days and the actual days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Overdue principal
and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest shall bear interest, payable upon demand, for each day from and including
the due date to but excluding the date of actual payment at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate of interest publicly
announced by the Lender from time to time as its prime rate. The Lender’s prime rate is a rate set by the Lender based upon
various factors including the Lender’s costs and desired return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used
as a reference point for pricing some loans, which may be priced at, above, or below such announced rate. Whenever any payment
under this Note is due on a day that is not a day the Lender is open to conduct substantially all of its business, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding day on which the Lender is open to conduct substantially all of its business, and such extension
of time shall in such case be included in the computation of the payment of interest.
Each of the following shall constitute
an Event of Default hereunder: (a) the Borrower shall fail to pay when due any principal of or interest on any Loan; (b) a default
or event of default shall occur under the terms of any other indebtedness for which the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries is
liable, whether as principal obligor, guarantor, or otherwise having an aggregate principal amount (including
undrawn committed or available amounts and including amounts owing to all creditors under any combined or syndicated credit arrangement)
in excess of $10,000,000; (c) any representation, warranty, certification, or statement made or deemed made by the Borrower
to the Lender shall prove to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect; (d) the Borrower shall dissolve, liquidate,
or terminate its legal existence or shall convey, transfer, lease, or dispose of (whether in one transaction or a series of transactions)
all or substantially all of its assets to any person or entity; (e) a petition shall be filed by or against the Borrower or any
of its subsidiaries under any law relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency, or (f) the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries
shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or fail generally to pay its debts as they become due, or a receiver, trustee,
or similar official shall be appointed over the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries or a substantial portion of any of their respective
assets. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lender may declare the outstanding principal of and accrued
and unpaid interest on this Note, together with all other amounts payable hereunder, to be immediately due and payable without
presentment, protest, demand, or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; provided , however ,
that upon the occurrence with respect to the Borrower of any event specified in clause (e) of the preceding sentence, the outstanding
principal and accrued and unpaid interest on this Note, together with all other amounts payable hereunder, shall become immediately
due and payable without presentment, protest, demand, or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.
     
     
    
 
The request of the Borrower for any
Loan and the receipt by the Borrower of the proceeds thereof shall be deemed a representation by the Borrower as of the date of
each such request or receipt that no Event of Default has occurred and that the Borrower is duly authorized to incur such indebtedness
hereunder.
No failure or delay by the Lender
in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies of the Lender provided herein shall be cumulative
and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided by law. If any provision of this Note shall be held invalid or unenforceable
in whole or in part, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof. No provision of this
Note may be modified or waived except by a written instrument signed by the Lender and the Borrower.
The Lender shall incur no liability
to the Borrower in acting upon any telephone, telex, or other communication that the Lender in good faith believes has been given
by an authorized representative of the Borrower.
The Lender may assign to one or more
banks or other entities all or any part of, or may grant participations to one or more banks or other entities in or to all or
any part of, this Note or any Loan or Loans hereunder.
The Borrower shall pay on demand
all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and the allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred by the
Lender in connection with any Event of Default or the enforcement or attempted enforcement of this Note.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the interest paid or agreed to be paid hereunder shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted
by applicable law (the “ Maximum Rate ”). If the Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excessive interest shall be applied to the principal of this Note or, if it exceeds the unpaid principal, refunded to
the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the Lender may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee,
or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate,
and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the stated term of this Note.
This Note shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey. The Borrower hereby submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
of the United States District Court and each state court in New Jersey as determined appropriate by the Lender for the purposes
of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Note. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and
any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. The Borrower and the Lender
by acceptance of this Note hereby irrevocably waive any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Note.

Re: Extension of Maturity Date
 
Dear Mr. O'Connor:
 
Reference is made to the Master Promissory
Note, dated July 18, 2008 (the "Note") in the original maximum principal amount of Three Million and 00/100 Dollars ($3,000,000),
executed by Utility Service Affiliates (Perth Amboy) Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Borrower") and delivered to
Bank of America, N.A. (the "Bank"), and the Uncommitted Line of Credit Letter Agreement, dated May 1, 2008, between the
Borrower and Bank (the "Letter Agreement”). The obligations to the Bank are guaranteed by Middlesex Water Company (the
“Guarantor”) under Continuing and Unconditional Guaranty, dated July 22, 2008 (the “Guaranty”). The Note,
Letter Agreement, Guaranty, and any and all other documents, instruments, and agreements executed in connection therewith are referred
to herein as the "Loan Documents". Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Loan
Documents.
 
The Borrower has requested that the
Note, the Letter Agreement, and alI documents, instruments, agreements and amendments that evidence, govern or secure the Note
(together with the Note, and the Loan Documents) be modified for the purpose of extending the Maturity Date (as such term is defined
in the Loan Documents) and the Bank has agreed to such extension.
 
The Bank agrees that the Maturity Date
as set forth in the Loan Documents shalI be extended from May 30, 2011 to May 30, 2012.
 
Upon (a) the execution and
delivery of this Letter Agreement by the Borrower and (b) receipt by the Bank of any unpaid payments under the Loan
Documents, if any, through but not including the date of the execution and delivery of this letter and the extension set
forth in this letter shall be effective and enforceable against the Borrower and Guarantor. Nothing herein contained or
implied shalI be construed as a waiver of any other provision of the Loan Documents or any other document executed in
connection with the Loan Documents or a waiver of any presently existing or future default in the non-payment of principal
and/or interest or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents.

Each of the Borrower and the Guarantor
hereby warrants and represents that the representations and warranties contained in the Loan Documents continue to be true and
correct and that no event of default, and no event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both would become an event
of default, has occurred or is continuing under the Loan Documents. The Borrower acknowledges that as of the date hereof there
are no offsets, defenses, claims, counterclaims, charges or deductions of any nature against amounts due and owing under the Note
or against the Bank or any of its officers, directors or employers.
 
The Borrower and the Guarantor hereby
ratify and confirm all respects and without condition all of the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents, as modified herein,
as applicable, and each agrees that said terms and provisions, except to the extent expressly modified herein, continue in full
force and effect.
 
This letter shall be binding upon
the Borrower and each endorser and guarantor of the Loan Documents (including the Guarantor) and their respective successors,
heirs and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Bank and its successors and assigns. This Agreement shall take effect
as a sealed instrument and shall be governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey.
 
In no event shall this letter
agreement constitute or be construed as a waiver or release of the obligations of any maker, guarantor, endorser or other
person liable for the Borrower's obligations under the Note, and the obligations of such parties shall remain in full force
and effect.
 
If this letter extending the Maturity
Date is acceptable, please acknowledge below and return the acknowledged copy to me.
 
If you have any questions, please contact
me.
 
     
    Sincerely,

    The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining

    a)       
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control
over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information; and
 
     
    b)       
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.

        Note 1  Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Recent Developments
 
(a) Organization - Middlesex
Water Company (Middlesex) is the parent company and sole shareholder of Tidewater Utilities, Inc. (Tidewater), Tidewater Environmental
Services, Inc. (TESI), Pinelands Water Company (Pinelands Water) and Pinelands Wastewater Company (Pinelands Wastewater) (collectively,
Pinelands), Utility Service Affiliates, Inc. (USA), Utility Service Affiliates (Perth Amboy) Inc. (USA-PA) and Twin Lakes Utilities,
Inc. (Twin Lakes). Southern Shores Water Company, LLC (Southern Shores) and White Marsh Environmental Systems, Inc. (White Marsh)
are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Tidewater. The financial statements for Middlesex and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company)
are reported on a consolidated basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Middlesex Water Company has operated as a water
utility in New Jersey since 1897, in Delaware, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tidewater, since 1992 and in Pennsylvania,
through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Twin Lakes, since 2009. We are in the business of collecting, treating, distributing and selling
water for domestic, commercial, municipal, industrial and fire protection purposes. We also operate a New Jersey municipal water
and wastewater system under contract and provide wastewater services in New Jersey and Delaware through our subsidiaries. Our rates
charged to customers for water and wastewater services, the quality of services we provide and certain other matters are regulated
in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), Delaware Public Service Commission
(DEPSC) and Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC), respectively. Only our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries are
not regulated utilities.
 
Certain reclassifications have been made
to the prior year financial statements to conform with current period presentation.
 
(b) System of Accounts 
Middlesex, Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater maintain their accounts in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts
prescribed by the NJBPU. Tidewater, TESI and Southern Shores maintain their accounts in accordance with DEPSC requirements. Twin
Lakes maintains its accounts in accordance with PAPUC requirements.
 
(c) Utility Plant 
Utility Plant is stated at original cost as defined for regulatory purposes. Property accounts are charged with the cost of
betterments and major replacements of property. Cost includes direct material, labor and indirect charges for pension benefits
and payroll taxes. The cost of labor, materials, supervision and other expenses incurred in making repairs and minor replacements
and in maintaining the properties is charged to the appropriate expense accounts. At December 31, 2011, there was no event or change
in circumstance that would indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset was not recoverable.
 
(d) Depreciation 
Depreciation is computed by each regulated member of the Company utilizing a rate approved by the applicable regulatory
authority. The Accumulated Provision for Depreciation is charged with the cost of property retired, less salvage. The
following table sets forth the range of depreciation rates for the major utility plant categories used to calculate
depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. These rates have been approved by the NJBPU, DEPSC or
PAPUC:

Non-regulated fixed assets consist primarily
of office buildings, furniture and fixtures, and transportation equipment. These assets are recorded at original cost and depreciation
is calculated based on the estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 40 years.
 
(e) Preliminary Survey and Investigation
(PS&I) Costs  In the design of water and wastewater systems that the Company ultimately intends to
construct, own and operate certain expenditures are incurred to advance those project activities. These PS&I costs are recorded
as deferred charges on the balance sheet because these costs are expected to be recovered through future rates charged to customers
as the underlying projects are placed into service as utility plant. If it is subsequently determined that costs for a project
recorded as PS&I are not recoverable through rates charged to our customers, the applicable PS&I costs are recorded as
a charge to the income statement at that time.
 
(f) Customers
Advances for Construction (CAC)  Water utility plant and/or cash advances are contributed to the Company by
customers, real estate developers and builders in order to extend water service to their properties. These contributions are
recorded as CAC. Refunds on these advances are made by the Company in accordance with agreements with the contributing party
and are based on either additional operating revenues related to the utility plant or as new customers are connected to and
take service from the utility plant. After all refunds are made and/or contract terms have expired, any remaining balance
is transferred to Contributions in Aid of Construction.
 
Contributions in Aid of Construction
(CIAC)  CIAC include direct non-refundable contributions of water utility plant and/or cash and the portion of CAC
that becomes non-refundable.
 
CAC and CIAC are not depreciated in accordance
with regulatory requirements. In addition, these amounts reduce the investment base for purposes of setting rates.
 
(g) Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC) - Middlesex and its regulated subsidiaries capitalize AFUDC, which represents the cost of financing
projects during construction. AFUDC is added to the construction costs of individual projects exceeding specific cost and construction
period thresholds established for each company and then depreciated along with the rest of the utility plants costs over
its estimated useful life. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately $0.8 million, $1.0 million, and
$1.0 million, respectively of AFUDC was added to the cost of construction projects. AFUDC is calculated using each companys
weighted cost of debt and equity as approved in their most recent respective regulatory rate order. The AFUDC rates for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 for Middlesex and Tidewater are as follows:

    7.65%
    Tidewater
    8.24%
    8.24%
    8.24%
(h) Accounts Receivable 
We record bad debt expense based on historical write-offs combined with an evaluation of current conditions. The allowance for
doubtful accounts was $0.6 million and $0.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Bad debt expense for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Receivables not expected
to be received in 2012 are included as non-current assets in Operations and Developer Contracts Receivable.
 
(i) Revenues - General metered
customers bills for regulated water service are typically comprised of two components; a fixed service charge and a volumetric
or consumption charge. Revenues from general metered service water customers, except Tidewater fixed service charges, include amounts
billed in arrears on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts estimated from the last meter reading date to the end of the accounting
period. The estimated unbilled amounts are determined by utilizing factors which include historical consumption usage and current
climate and economic conditions. Actual billings may differ from our estimates. Tidewater customers are billed in advance for their
fixed service charge and these revenues are recognized as the service is provided to the customer.
 
Southern Shores is an unmetered system. Customers
are billed a fixed service charge in advance at the beginning of each month and revenues are recognized as earned.
 
Revenues from the City of Perth Amboy management
contract are comprised of fixed and variable fees. Fixed fees, which have been set for the life of the contract, are billed monthly
and recorded as earned. Variable fees, which are not significant, are recorded upon approval of the amount by the City of Perth
Amboy.
 
(j) Deferred Charges and Other
Assets - Unamortized Debt Expense is amortized over the lives of the related issues. Restricted Cash represents proceeds from
loans entered into through state financing programs and is held in trusts. The proceeds are restricted for specific capital expenditures
and debt service requirements.
 
(k) Income Taxes - Middlesex
files a consolidated federal income tax return for the Company and income taxes are allocated based on the separate return method.
Investment tax credits have been deferred and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the related property. For more information
on income taxes, see Note 3  Income Taxes.
 
(l) Statements of Cash Flows
- For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents represent bank balances and money market funds with investments
maturing in less than 90 days.
 
(m) Use of Estimates - Conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
(n) Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
- In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-04, which
amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (ASC 820), to update guidance
related to fair value measurements and disclosures as a step towards achieving convergence between generally accepted accounting
principles and international financial reporting standards. ASU 2011-04 clarifies intent about application of existing fair value
measurements and disclosures, changes certain requirements for fair value measurements and requires expanded disclosures. ASU
2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Adoption of 2011-04 is not expected to
have any impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
 
In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, which amends ASC 820, to add new requirements for
disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and
settlements relating to Level 3 measurements. ASU 2010-06 also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of
disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Further, ASU 2010-06 amends guidance on
employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets under ASC 715, Compensation  Retirement
Benefits to require that disclosures be provided by classes of assets instead of by major categories of assets.  Adoption
of ASU 2010-06 had no impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
 
(o) Regulatory Accounting - We
maintain our books and records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Middlesex
and certain of its subsidiaries, which account for 90% of Operating Revenues and 98% of Total Assets, are subject to regulation
in the state in which they operate. Those companies are required to maintain their accounts in accordance with regulatory authorities
rules and guidelines, which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows
the guidance provided in ASC 980, Regulated Operations .
 
In accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations ,
costs and obligations are deferred if it is probable that these items will be recognized for rate-making purposes in future rates.
Accordingly, we have recorded costs and obligations, which will be amortized over various future periods. Any change in the assessment
of the probability of rate-making treatment will require us to change the accounting treatment of the deferred item. We have no
reason to believe any of the deferred items that are recorded will be treated differently by the regulators in the future. For
additional information, see Note 2  Rate and Regulatory Matters.
 
(p) Postretirement Benefit Plans
- We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan) which covers substantially all active employees who
were hired prior to March 31, 2007. In addition, the Company maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers.
The Company has a postretirement benefit plan other than pensions (Other Benefits Plan) for substantially all of its retired employees.
Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate in this plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance.
 
The Companys costs for providing postretirement
benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience. Postretirement
benefit plan obligations and expense are determined based on investment performance, discount rates and various other demographic
factors related to the population participating in the Companys postretirement benefit plans, all of which can change significantly
in future years. For more information on the Companys Postretirement Benefit Plans, see Note 7  Employee Benefit
Plans.

            - Definition
                Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

            - Definition
                Represents the noncurrent portion of deferred tax liabilities, which result from applying the applicable tax rate to net taxable temporary differences pertaining to each jurisdiction to which the entity is obligated to pay income tax. A noncurrent taxable temporary difference is a difference between the tax basis and the carrying amount of a noncurrent asset or liability in the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In a classified statement of financial position, an enterprise separates deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting. A deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting, including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards, are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference.

            - Definition
                Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

                The net cash from (used in) all of the entity's operating activities, including those of discontinued operations, of the reporting entity. Operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and providing services. Operating activity cash flows include transactions, adjustments, and changes in value that are not defined as investing or financing activities. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a debit balance consistent with its label.

Contract Operations - USA-PA operates
the City of Perth Amboy, NJs water and wastewater systems under a 20-year agreement, which expires in 2018. In connection
with the agreement with Perth Amboy, USA-PA entered into a 20-year subcontract with a wastewater operating company for the operation
and maintenance of the Perth Amboy wastewater collection system. The subcontract provides for the sharing of certain fixed and
variable fees and operating expenses.
 
Construction The Company may
spend up to $21.8 million in 2012, $18.0 million in 2013 and $16.4 million in 2014 on its construction program. The actual amount
and timing of capital expenditures is dependent on customer growth, residential new home construction and sales and project scheduling.
There is no assurance that projected customer growth and residential new home construction and sales will occur.
 
Litigation  The Company is a
defendant in lawsuits in the normal course of business. We believe the resolution of pending claims and legal proceedings will
not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.
 
Change in Control Agreements 
The Company has Change in Control Agreements with certain of its officers that provide compensation and benefits in the event of
termination of employment in connection with a change in control of the Company.

The statutory review periods for income tax returns for the
years prior to 2009 have been closed. An examination by the Internal Revenue Service of Middlesexs Federal income tax returns
for 2007 and 2008 was completed during 2010 and resulted in a net refund, including interest, of less than $0.1 million. The refund
noted above was recorded to the appropriate current and deferred tax accounts and the interest was reported as other income. In
the event that there are interest and penalties associated with income tax adjustments in future examinations, these amounts will
be reported under interest expense and other expense, respectively. There are no unrecognized tax benefits resulting from prior
period tax positions. The Company is not aware of any uncertain tax positions that could result in a future tax liability.
 
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net
tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. The components of the net deferred tax liability are as follows:

        Employee Benefit Plans
        Note 7 - Employee Benefit Plans
 
Pension Benefits
The Companys Pension Plan covers
substantially all active employees hired prior to March 31, 2007. Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate
in this plan, but can participate in a defined contribution plan that provides an annual contribution at the discretion of the
Company, based upon a percentage of the participants compensation. In order to be eligible for contribution, the eligible
employee must be employed by the Company on December 31 st of the year to which the award relates. In addition, the Company
maintains an unfunded supplemental plan for its executive officers. The Accumulated Benefit Obligation for the Companys
Pension Plan at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $46.5 million and $33.8 million, respectively.
 
Other Benefits
The Companys Other Benefits Plan
covers substantially all of its retired employees. Employees hired after March 31, 2007 are not eligible to participate in this
plan. Coverage includes healthcare and life insurance. Accrued retirement benefit costs are recorded each year.
 
The Company has recognized a deferred
regulatory asset relating to the difference between the accrued retirement benefit costs and actual cash paid for plan premiums
in years prior to 1998. Included in the regulatory asset is a transition obligation from adopting Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No.106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions, on January 1, 1993.
In addition to the recognition of annual accrued retirement benefit costs in rates, Middlesex is also recovering the transition
obligation over 15 years. The regulatory asset related to this transition obligation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $0.1 million
and $0.2 million, respectively.
 
Regulatory Treatment of Over/Underfunded
Retirement Obligations
Because the Company is subject to regulation
in the states in which it operates, it is required to maintain its accounts in accordance with the regulatory authoritys
rules and guidelines, which may differ from other authoritative accounting pronouncements. In those instances, the Company follows
the guidance of ASC 980, Regulated Operations . Based on prior regulatory practice, and in accordance with the guidance in
ASC 980, Regulated Operations , the Company records underfunded Pension Plan and Other Benefits Plan obligations, which otherwise
would be recognized as Other Comprehensive Income under  ASC 715, Compensation  Retirement Benefits , as a
Regulatory Asset, and expects to recover those costs in rates charged to customers.
 
The Company uses a December 31 measurement
date for all of its employee benefit plans. The table below sets forth information relating to the Companys Pension Plan
and Other Benefits Plan for 2011 and 2010.

The compensation increase assumption for
the Other Benefits Plan is attributable to life insurance provided to qualifying employees upon their retirement. The insurance
coverage will be determined based on the employees base compensation as of their retirement date.
 
For the 2011 valuation, costs and
obligations for our Other Benefits Plan assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare
benefits in 2012 with a decline of 1.0% per year for 2013-2015 and 0.5% per year for 2016-2017, resulting in an annual rate
of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits of 5% by year 2017.
 
A one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates
would have the following effects on the Other Benefits Plan:

Two outside investment firms each manage
a portion of the Pension Plan asset portfolio. One of those investment firms also manages the Other Benefits Plan asset portfolio.
Quarterly meetings are held between the Companys Pension Committee of the Board of Directors and the investment managers
to review their performance and asset allocation. If the actual asset allocation is outside the targeted range, the Pension Committee
reviews current market conditions and advice provided by the investment managers to determine the appropriateness of rebalancing
the portfolio.
 
The objective of the Company is to maximize
the long-term return on retirement plan assets, relative to a reasonable level of risk, maintain a diversified investment portfolio
and maintain compliance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. The expected long-term rate of return is based
on the various asset categories in which plan assets are invested and the current expectations and historical performance for these
categories.
 
Equity securities include Middlesex common
stock in the amounts of $0.7 million (2.3% of total plan assets) and $0.7 million (2.4 % of total pension plan assets) at December
31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Fair Value Measurements
Accounting guidance provides a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:
 
     
    ·         
    Level 1  Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical
assets or liabilities in accessible active markets.
     
    ·         
    Level 2  Inputs to the valuation methodology that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. If the
asset or liability has a specified contractual term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the
asset or liability.
     
    ·         
    Level 3  Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair
value measurement.
 
Certain investments in cash and cash equivalents,
equity securities, and commodities are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1 investments.
Certain investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities and fixed income securities are valued using prices received
from pricing vendors that utilize observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2 investments.

For the Pension Plan, Middlesex made total
cash contributions of $3.6 million in 2011 and expects to make cash contributions of approximately $4.1 million in 2012.
 
For the Other Benefits Plan, Middlesex made
total cash contributions of $3.3 million in 2011 and expects to make contributions of approximately $4.8 million in 2012.
 
401(k) Plan
The Company has a 401(k) defined contribution
plan, which covers substantially all employees with more than 1,000 hours of service. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company
matches 100% of a participants contributions, which do not exceed 1% of a participants compensation, plus 50% of
a participants contributions exceeding 1%, but not more than 6%. The Companys matching contributions were $0.5 million
for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
 
For those employees hired after March
31, 2007 and still employed on December 31, 2011, the Company approved and will fund discretionary contribution of $0.2 million,
which was based on 5.0% of eligible 2011 compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company made discretionary
contributions of $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for those employees hired after March 31, 2007.
 
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has a stock compensation plan
for certain management employees (the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan). The Company maintains an escrow account for 0.1 million shares
of the Company's common stock for the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan. Such stock is subject to an agreement requiring forfeiture by
the employee in the event of termination of employment within five years of the award other than as a result of retirement, death,
disability or change in control. The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the 2008 Restricted Stock Plan is 0.3
million shares, for which 0.2 million remain as unissued shares.
 
The Company recognizes compensation expense at fair value for
the restricted stock awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation  Stock Compensation . Compensation expense
is determined by the market value of the stock on the date of the award and is being amortized over a five-year period.

All the transactions discussed below related
to the issuance of securities were approved by either the NJBPU or DEPSC, except where otherwise noted.
 
Common Stock
In June 2010, the Company sold and issued
1.9 million shares of common stock in a public offering that was priced at $15.21 per share. The net proceeds of approximately
$27.8 million were used to repay certain of the Companys short-term debt outstanding.
 
The number of shares authorized under
the Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) is 2.3 million shares. The cumulative number of shares issued under
the DRP at December 31, 2011, is 2.0 million.
 
The Company issues shares under a restricted
stock plan for certain management employees, which is described in Note 7  Employee Benefit Plans.
 
The Company maintains a stock plan for its
outside directors (the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan). In 2011, 3,833 shares of common stock were granted and issued
to the Companys outside directors under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan and 93,197 shares remain available
for future awards. The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the Outside Director Stock Compensation Plan is 100,000.
 
In the event dividends on the preferred
stock are in arrears, no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company. At December 31, 2011, no preferred
stock dividends were in arrears.
 
Preferred Stock
If four or more quarterly dividends are
in arrears, the preferred shareholders, as a class, are entitled to elect two members to the Board of Directors in addition to
Directors elected by holders of the common stock. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were less than 0.1 million shares of preferred
stock authorized and outstanding and there were no dividends in arrears.
 
The Company may not pay any dividends
on its common stock unless full cumulative dividends to the preceding dividend date for all outstanding shares of preferred stock
have been paid or set aside for payment. All such preferred dividends have been paid. In addition, if Middlesex were to liquidate,
holders of preferred stock would be paid back the stated value of their preferred shares before any distributions could be made
to common stockholders.
 
The conversion feature of the no par $7.00
Series Cumulative and Convertible Preferred Stock allows the security holders to exchange one convertible preferred share for twelve
shares of the Company's common stock. In addition, the Company may redeem up to 10% of the outstanding convertible stock in any
calendar year at a price equal to the fair market value of twelve shares of the Company's common stock for each share of convertible
stock redeemed. In February 2011, the Company repurchased 93 shares of its $7.00 Series, nonredeemable cumulative preferred stock
at par value for approximately $9 thousand.
 
The conversion feature of the no par $8.00
Series Cumulative and Convertible Preferred Stock allows the security holders to exchange one convertible preferred share for 13.714
shares of the Company's common stock. The preferred shares are convertible into common stock at the election of the security holder
or Middlesex.

Note for a specific project. The interest rate on any draw-down will be set at 3.45% with a final maturity of August 1, 2031 on
the amount actually borrowed. As of December 31, 2011, Tidewater has borrowed $39 thousand under this loan.
 
In March 2009, Tidewater closed on a $22.0
million DEPSC approved loan. In 2009, Tidewater borrowed $12.0 million under this loan. In March 2010, Tidewater borrowed the remaining
$10.0 million at a rate of 5.69% with a final maturity in January 2030.
 
First Mortgage Bonds Series S through
W and Series DD are term bonds with single maturity dates subsequent to 2015. Principal repayments for all series of the Companys
long-term debt extend beyond 2016. The aggregate annual principal repayment obligations for all long-term debt over the next five
years are shown below:

    2016
    $5.2
The weighted average interest rate on
all long-term debt at both December 31, 2011 and 2010 was 5.13%. Except for the Amortizing Secured Notes, all of the Companys
outstanding long-term debt has been issued through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority ($57.5 million), the NJEIT program
($29.9 million) and the Delaware SRF program ($9.6 million).
Restricted cash includes proceeds from
various New Jersey SRF loans. These funds are held in trusts and restricted for specific capital expenditures and debt service
requirements. As discussed above, Series MM and NN proceeds can only be used for the applicable RENEW Program. All other bond issuance
balances in restricted cash are for debt service requirements.
In 2011, the NJEIT deobligated $560 thousand
of principal payments on several Series of SRF long-term debt.
Substantially all of the Utility
Plant of the Company is subject to the lien of its mortgage, which includes debt service and capital ratio covenants. The Company
is in compliance with all of its mortgage covenants and restrictions.
Earnings Per Share
The following table presents the calculation
of basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the three years ended December 31, 2011. Basic EPS is computed on the basis of
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted EPS assumes the conversion of both the Convertible Preferred Stock $7.00
Series and $8.00 Series.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were
used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value. The carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables,
accounts payable and notes payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt relating to First Mortgage and SRF bonds is based on quoted market prices
for similar issues. The carrying amount and fair value of the Companys bonds were as follows:

    State Revolving Bonds  
    $ 793    
    $ 799    
    $ 919    
    $ 937  
 
For other long-term debt for which there was
no quoted market price, it was not practicable to estimate their fair value. The carrying amount of these instruments was $49.3
million and $48.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Customer advances for construction have a carrying amount
of $21.9 million and $21.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Their relative fair values cannot be accurately
estimated since future refund payments depend on several variables, including new customer connections, customer consumption levels
and future rate increases.

        Note 8  Business Segment
Data
 
The Company has identified two reportable segments.
One is the regulated business of collecting, treating and distributing water on a retail and wholesale basis to residential, commercial,
industrial and fire protection customers in parts of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. This segment also includes regulated
wastewater systems in New Jersey and Delaware. The Company is subject to regulations as to its rates, services and other matters
by the states of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania with respect to utility service within these states. The other segment is
primarily comprised of non-regulated contract services for the operation and maintenance of municipal and private water and wastewater
systems in New Jersey and Delaware.
 
Inter-segment transactions relating to operational
costs are treated as pass-through expenses. Finance charges on inter-segment loan activities are based on interest rates that are
below what would normally be charged by a third party lender.

        Rate Matters
        Note 2 - Rate and Regulatory Matters
 
Rate Matters
 
Middlesex - In January 2012, Middlesex
filed an application with the NJBPU seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $11.3 million per year. The
request was made as a result of capital investments Middlesex has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the NJBPU is not expected until the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
In August 2011, Middlesex implemented a NJBPU
approved Purchased Water Adjustment Clause (PWAC), which allows for the recovery of increased costs of $0.4 million to purchase
untreated water from the New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA) and treated water from a non-affiliated regulated water utility.
It is expected that the PWAC rate will reset to zero as part of the ultimate decision rendered in the aforementioned Middlesex
base rate increase request.
 
In March 2010, the NJBPU granted
an increase in Middlesexs annual operating revenues of 13.57%, or $7.8 million. The increase was  necessitated
by increased costs, as well as to provide a return on invested capital in rate base of $180.3 million based on a return on
equity of 10.30%.
 
Tidewater  In September 2011,
Tidewater filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $6.9 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments Tidewater has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until the second half of 2012. In connection with the base rate increase request, Tidewater
implemented a DEPSC approved 10.49% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on November 15, 2011.
 
A Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)
is a DEPSC approved rate-mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investment in non-revenue producing capital improvements
to the water system between base rate proceedings. The following summarizes Tidewaters approved DSIC rates from January
1, 2011 through November 15, 2011, when Tidewaters DSIC was set to 0.0% in connection with the aforementioned 10.49% interim
rate increase:
 
             Date
    January 1, 2011
    July 1, 2011
    % Increase
    0.27%
    0.64%
    Cumulative %
    1.34%
    1.98%
 
In September 2009, the DEPSC approved an overall
14.95% or $3.0 million increase in Tidewaters base rates. This rate increase approval is based on a 10.0% return on equity.
 
TESI  In July 2011,
TESI filed an application with the DEPSC seeking permission to increase its base rates by approximately $0.8 million per year.
The request was made as a result of capital investments TESI has made, or has committed to make, as well as increased operations
and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the DEPSC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the request.
A decision by the DEPSC is not expected until mid 2012. In connection with the base rate increase request, TESI implemented a DEPSC
approved 7.6% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on September 28, 2011.
 
Southern Shores  Effective
June 1, 2011, the DEPSC approved a multi-year agreement for a phased-in base rate increase for Southern Shores.  This increase
was made as a result of capital investment in the upgrade and renovation of Southern Shores primary water treatment facilities,
as well as by increased operating costs.  Under the terms of the agreement, which expires on June 30, 2020, Southern Shores
also increased rates on January 1, 2012, and will do so on each successive January 1 st through 2015, to generate approximately
$0.1 million of additional revenue on an annual basis with each increase. Thereafter, rate increases, if any, cannot exceed the
lesser of the regional Consumer Price Index or 3%.
 
In accordance with the tariff established for
Southern Shores, an annual rate increase of 8.9% was implemented in January 2012.
 
Twin Lakes  In
December 2011, Twin Lakes and the interveners in the Twin Lakes Rate Case reached a settlement that provided a $0.1 million,
three-year phased-in base rate increase for Twin Lakes.  This increase was made as a result of capital investment in the
upgrade and renovation of the Twin Lakes System, as well as by increased operating costs.  The settlement was approved
by the PAPUC in March 2012.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
We have recorded certain costs as regulatory
assets because we expect full recovery of, or are currently recovering, these costs in the rates we charge customers. These deferred
costs have been excluded from rate base and, therefore, we are not earning a return on the unamortized balances. These items are
detailed as follows:

      2-9 years  
    Total  
    $ 67,302    
    $ 38,771    
         
 
 
Postretirement benefits include pension and
other postretirement benefits that have been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with the guidance provided
in ASC 715 , Compensation  Retirement Benefits. These amounts represent obligations in excess of current funding,
which the Company believes will be fully recovered in rates set by the regulatory authorities.
 
The recovery period for income taxes is dependent
upon when the temporary differences between the tax and book treatment of various items reverse.
 
The Company uses composite depreciation rates
for its regulated utility assets, which is currently an acceptable method under generally accepted accounting principles and is
widely used in the utility industry. Historically, under the composite depreciation method, the anticipated costs of removing assets
upon retirement are provided for over the life of those assets as a component of depreciation expense. The Company recovers certain
asset retirement costs through rates charged to customers as an approved component of depreciation expense. As of December 31,
2011 and 2010, the Company has approximately $8.0 and $7.4 million, respectively, of expected costs of removal recovered currently
in rates in excess of actual costs incurred. These amounts are recorded as regulatory liabilities.
 
The Company is recovering in current rates
acquisition premiums totaling $0.7 million over the remaining lives of the underlying Utility Plant. These deferred costs have
been included in rate base as utility plant and a return is being earned on the unamortized balances during the recovery periods.
The Company expects to recover training costs of approximately $0.8 million associated with implementation of a new information
technology system in future rates. These costs are included in General Utility Plant.
