General development of business
 
Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the “Fund”) is a limited partnership, which was organized on May 11, 1993 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. The Registrant operates as a commodity investment pool, whose purpose is to trade speculatively in the U.S. and international futures and forward markets. Specifically, the Fund trades in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies and commodities.
 
The general partner and trading advisor of the Registrant is Campbell & Company, Inc. (“Campbell & Company”). In addition to making all trading decisions in its capacity as trading advisor, Campbell & Company conducts and manages all aspects of the business and administration of the Registrant in its role as general partner. Campbell & Company uses a systematic trading approach combined with quantitative portfolio management analysis and seeks to identify and profit from price movements in the futures and forward markets. Multiple trading models are utilized across most markets traded. Each model analyzes market movements and internal market and price configurations in order to generate signals to be executed through a variety of execution platforms.
 
During the continuous offering, the Fund was a registrant with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and was subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. (Units in the Fund are no longer offered, as described below.) The Fund is a "reporting company" subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a commodity investment pool, the Fund is subject to the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC"), an agency of the United States government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association (the "NFA"), an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various commodity exchanges where the Fund executes transactions. Additionally, the Fund is subject to the requirements of futures commission merchants and interbank market makers through which the Fund trades.
 
Effective January 6, 2012, Units in the Fund were no longer offered for sale. For existing investors in the Fund, business has been and will be conducted as usual. There will be no change in trading, operations or monthly statements, etc., and redemptions will continue to be offered on a monthly basis. 
 
A total of $6,078,611,354 was raised during the initial and continuing offering periods ending with the withdrawal of the Fund's Registration Statement on January 6, 2012.
 
The Registrant will be terminated and dissolved promptly thereafter upon the happening of the earlier of: (a) the expiration of the Registrant’s stated term of December 31, 2023; (b) an election to dissolve the Registrant at any time by Limited Partners owning more than 50% of the Units then outstanding; (c) the withdrawal of Campbell & Company, unless one or more new general partners have been elected or appointed pursuant to the Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended; (d) Campbell & Company determines that the purpose of the Fund cannot be fulfilled; or (e) any event which shall make unlawful the continuing existence of the Registrant.
  
Financial information about industry segments
 
The Fund’s business constitutes only one segment for financial reporting purposes, i.e., a speculative “commodity pool.” The Fund does not engage in sales of goods or services.
 
Narrative description of business
 
General
 
The purpose of the Fund is to engage in the speculative trading, buying, selling, or otherwise acquiring, holding or disposing of commodities, including futures contracts, forward contracts and any other rights pertaining thereto, and for such other purposes as may be incidental or related thereto. Prior to September 1, 2011, the Fund also traded options on forward currency contracts. The Fund has no employees.
 
The Fund trades pursuant to Campbell's Financial, Metal & Energy Large Portfolio (the “FME Large Portfolio”) . The FME Large Portfolio seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a broad range of market conditions through systematic investments in a diversified portfolio of futures and forward contracts in a diverse array of global assets, including global interest rates, stock indices, currencies and commodities. The FME Large Portfolio consists of underlying investment strategies, both trend following and non-trend following in nature, that aim for low correlation and are diversified by investment style, investment holding period and instrument. Trend following strategies apply traditional and alternative trend following methods to systematically exploit futures market moves through the use of price information. Some trend following strategies trade all markets while others are specific to certain sectors or factors. Non-trend following strategies develop relative value and fundamental themes to systematically exploit asset mispricings using carry, spread, and directional methods. Non-trend following strategies tend to be specific to certain sectors and employ global tactical asset allocation methodologies. Other technical strategies, based on statistical indicators, use varying lookback and holding periods to identify mispricings, complimentary to trend following. Additional models, markets and/or over-the-counter contracts may also be included or eliminated from time to time at Campbell & Company’s sole discretion without notice to unitholders.
  
1
  
The average sector allocation for each sector as of the previous six month ends, through December 31, 2011 is as follows: 31% to interest rates, 28% to foreign exchange, 28% to commodities, and 13% to equity indices. Sector allocation for each sector is calculated using the dollar value of margin posted as collateral to support trading in each sector as a percentage of the total dollar value of margin posted to support trading in all sectors. 
 
Use of Proceeds 
 
Effective January 6, 2012, Units in the Fund were no longer offered for sale. For existing investors in the Fund, business has been and will be conducted as usual. The entire offering proceeds, without deductions, were credited to the Fund’s bank, brokerage and/or cash management accounts. The Fund meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash or U.S. government securities with the futures brokers and the over-the-counter counterparties. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures and forward contracts. The Fund receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Fund assets.
 
Approximately 10% to 30% of the Fund’s assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 10% to 30% of the Fund’s assets are deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparties.
 
The general partner deposits the majority of those assets of the Fund that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in custodial accounts with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial accounts with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial accounts constitute approximately 40% to 80% of the Fund’s assets and are invested directly by Horizon Cash Management LLC (“Horizon”). Horizon is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Horizon does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Fund’s assets in the custodial account. Horizon will invest according to agreed upon investment guidelines that are modeled after those investments allowed by the futures broker as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act, Title 17, Part 1, § 1.25 Investment of customer funds. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; and (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt.
 
The Fund occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparties, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody accounts at Northern Trust to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Fund has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.
 
The Fund’s assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell & Company or any affiliated entities.
 
Cash Manager and Custodian
 
The Fund appointed Horizon as cash manager (the “Cash Manager”) under the Investment Advisory Agreement dated July 8, 2009 to manage and control the liquid assets of the Fund. The Cash Manager is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC of the United States under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Cash Manager specializes in investments which are predominately short-term in maturity and high grade, high quality in nature with particular emphasis on U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government Agencies’ issues. 
 
The Fund opened a custodial account at The Northern Trust Company (the “Custodian”), and has granted the Cash Manager a limited power of attorney over such accounts. Such power of attorney gives the Cash Manager authority to make certain investments on behalf of the Fund provided such investments are consistent with the investment guidelines created by the managing operator to the Fund. Such investments include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, securities issued by U.S. Government Agencies, high quality money-market securities and repurchase agreements. All securities purchased by the Cash Manager on behalf of the Fund or other liquid funds of the Fund will be held in its custody account at the custodian. The Cash Manager will have no beneficial or other interest in the securities and cash in such custody account.

Market Sectors
 
Campbell & Company’s FME Large Portfolio trades in a fully diversified portfolio of futures and forward markets, including energy products (Brent crude, gas oil, heating oil, natural gas, unleaded gasoline and WTI Crude), agricultural products (wheat, corn, coffee, sugar, soy, hogs, cattle and cotton), precious and base metals (aluminum, copper, gold, nickel, silver and zinc), stock market indices (AEX, CAC 40, DAX, DJ Euro Stoxx 50, Dow Jones Mini, FTSE, Hang Seng, IBEX, MSCI, NASDAQ, Nikkei, S&P 500, S&P Canada 60 Index Futures and Share Price 200 Index), interest rates (short-term and long-term) and foreign currencies (majors, minors and cross rates).
 
Market Types
 
The Fund trades on a variety of United States and foreign futures exchanges, and in the off-exchange highly liquid, institutionally-based currency forward markets. As in the case of its market sector allocations, the Fund’s commitments to different types of markets — U.S. and non-U.S., regulated and non-regulated — differ substantially from time to time, as well as over time, and may change at any time if Campbell & Company determines such change to be in the best interests of the Fund.

Regulation
 
The U.S. futures markets are regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, which is administered by the CFTC, a federal agency created in 1974. The CFTC licenses and regulates commodity exchanges, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors and clearing firms which are referred to in the futures industry as “futures commission merchants.” Campbell & Company is licensed by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor. Futures professionals are also regulated by the NFA, a self-regulatory organization for the futures industry that supervises the dealings between futures professionals and their customers. If its pertinent CFTC licenses or NFA memberships were to lapse, be suspended, or be revoked, Campbell & Company would be unable to act as the Fund’s commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor.
 
 
3
 
The CFTC has adopted disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for commodity pool operators and disclosure and recordkeeping requirements for commodity trading advisors. The reporting rules require pool operators to furnish to the participants in their pools a monthly statement of account, showing the pool’s income or loss and change in net asset value, and an annual financial report, audited by an independent certified public accountant.
 
The CFTC and the exchanges have pervasive powers over the futures markets, including the emergency power to suspend trading and order trading for liquidation of existing positions only. The exercise of such powers could adversely affect the Fund’s trading.
 
The CFTC does not regulate forward contracts. Federal and state banking authorities also do not regulate forward trading or forward dealers. Trading in foreign currency forward contracts may be less liquid and the Fund’s trading results may be adversely affected.
 
Available Information
 
The Fund files quarterly, annual and current reports with the SEC. These reports are available to read and copy at the SEC’s Public Reference Facilities in Washington, D.C. at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC’s toll free number, 1-800-SEC-0330, for further information. The Fund does not maintain a website where these reports are posted. However, the Fund’s filings are posted on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov .
 
Item 1A.  Risk Factors.
 
Market Risks
 
You Could Possibly Lose Your Total Investment in the Fund
 
Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Consequently, you could lose all or a substantial amount of your investment in the Fund.
The Fund is Highly Leveraged
 
Because the amount of margin funds necessary to be deposited in order to enter into a futures and forward contract position is typically about 2% to 10% of the total value of the contract, Campbell & Company is able to hold positions in the Fund’s account with face values equal to several times the Fund’s net asset value. The ratio of margin to equity is typically 10% to 30%. As a result of this leveraging, even a small movement in the price of a contract can cause major losses.
 
Changes In Financing Policies or the Imposition of Other Credit Limitations or Restrictions Could Compel the Fund to Liquidate Positions at Disadvantageous Prices
 
The Fund may utilize and may depend on the availability of credit in order to trade its portfolio. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to maintain adequate financing arrangements under all market circumstances. As a general matter, the dealers that provide financing to the Fund can apply essentially discretionary margin, haircut, financing security and collateral valuation policies. Changes by dealers in such financing policies, or the imposition of other credit limitations or restrictions, whether due to market circumstances or governmental, regulatory or judicial action, may result in large margin calls, loss of financing, forced liquidation of positions at disadvantageous prices, termination of swap and repurchase agreements and cross-defaults to agreements with other dealers. Any such adverse effects may be exacerbated in the event that such limitations or restrictions are imposed suddenly and/or by multiple market participants at or about the same time. The imposition of such limitations or restrictions could compel the Fund to liquidate all or part of its portfolio at disadvantageous prices. Recently, banks and dealers have substantially curtailed financing activities and increased collateral requirements, forcing many hedge funds to liquidate.

The Fund’s Investments Could Be Illiquid
 
Futures and forward positions cannot always be liquidated at the desired price; this can occur when the market is thinly traded (i.e., a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders) or in the event of disrupted markets and other extraordinary events in which historical pricing relationships become materially distorted. The financing available to the Fund from banks, dealers and other counterparties is likely to be restricted in disrupted markets. The Fund may incur material losses and the risk of loss from pricing distortions is compounded by the fact that in disrupted markets many positions become illiquid making it difficult or impossible to close out positions against which the markets are moving. For example, in 1994, 1998 and again from 2007 — 2009, there was a sudden restriction of credit by the dealer community that resulted in forced liquidations and major losses for a number of private investment funds. It is possible that in the future, in such situations, Campbell & Company may be unable for some time to liquidate certain unprofitable positions thereby increasing the loss to the Fund from the trade. Additionally, foreign governments may take or be subject to political actions which disrupt the markets in their currency or major exports, such as energy products or metals. Market disruptions caused by unexpected political, military and terrorist events may from time to time cause dramatic losses for the Fund, and such events can result in otherwise historically low-risk strategies performing with unprecedented volatility and risk. Any of these actions could also result in losses to the Fund. Units should be owned only by persons financially able to maintain their investment and who can afford the loss of all or substantially all of such investment.
Reduced Market Exposure in Times of High Volatility May Limit Profit Potential
 
During periods of high volatility in the markets, the Fund may reduce its market exposure. While the purpose of such reductions is to attempt to limit potential losses to the Fund, such reductions may also have the effect of limiting potential profits for such time as the Fund’s market exposure remains in a reduced state.
 
Your Investment in the Fund Could Be Illiquid
 
There is no secondary market for the Units and none is expected to develop. While the Units have redemption rights, there are restrictions, and possible fees assessed. For example, redemptions from the Fund can occur only at the end of a month. If a large number of redemption requests were to be received at one time for the Fund, the Fund might have to liquidate positions to satisfy the requests. Such a forced liquidation could adversely affect the Fund and consequently your investment.
 
Transfers of interest in the Units are subject to limitations, such as 30 days’ advance notice of any intent to transfer. Also, Campbell & Company may deny a request to transfer if it determines that the transfer may result in adverse legal or tax consequences for the Fund.
 
Over-the-Counter Transactions are Subject to Little, if Any, Regulation
 
The Fund trades forward contracts in foreign currencies. Such contracts are typically traded over-the-counter through a dealer market, which is dominated by major money center and investment banks, and is not regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Thus, you do not receive the protection of CFTC regulation or the statutory scheme of the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with this trading activity by the Fund. The market for forward contracts relies upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets. This regulation includes, for example, trading practices and other customer protection requirements, and minimum financial and trade reporting requirements. The absence of regulation could expose the Fund to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants in the forward markets which it might otherwise have avoided.
 
Over-the-Counter Transactions May Be Subject to the Risk of Counterparty Default
 
The Fund faces the risk of non-performance by its counterparties to forward contracts and such non-performance may cause some or all of its gains to remain unrealized.
 
 
5
 
Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. The clearing member, clearing organization or other counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations, in which case, the Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts.
 
An Investment in the Fund May Not Diversify an Overall Portfolio
 
Historically, alternative investments such as managed futures funds have been generally non-correlated to the performance of other asset classes such as stocks and bonds. Non-correlation means that there is no statistically valid relationship between the past performance of futures and forward contracts on the one hand and stocks or bonds on the other hand. Non-correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be exactly opposite. Because of this non-correlation, the Fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market or vice versa. The futures and forward markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain made in a futures and forward transaction, the opposing side of that transaction will have an equal and  off-setting loss. If the Fund does not perform in a manner non-correlated with the general financial markets or does not perform successfully, you will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in the Units and the Fund may have no gains to offset your losses from other investments.
 
The Current Markets are Subject to Market Disruptions That May Be a Detriment to Your Investment
 
The global financial markets have recently undergone pervasive and fundamental disruptions which have led to extensive and unprecedented governmental intervention. Such intervention has, in certain cases, been implemented on an “emergency” basis, suddenly and substantially eliminating market participants’ ability to continue to implement certain strategies or manage the risk of their outstanding positions. In addition, as one would expect given the complexities of the financial markets and the limited time frame within which governments have felt compelled to take action, these interventions have typically been unclear in scope and application, resulting in confusion and uncertainty which in itself has been materially detrimental to the efficient functioning of the markets as well as to previously successful investment strategies.
 
The Fund may incur major losses in the event of disrupted markets and other extraordinary events in which historical pricing relationships become materially distorted. The risk of loss from pricing distortions is compounded by the fact that in disrupted markets many positions become illiquid, making it difficult or impossible to close out positions against which the markets are moving. The financing available to the Fund from its banks, dealers and other counterparties is typically reduced in disrupted markets. Such a reduction may result in substantial losses to the Fund. Market disruptions may from time to time cause dramatic losses for the Fund, and such events can result in otherwise historically low-risk strategies performing with unprecedented volatility and risk.
 
The Current Markets are Subject to Governmental Intervention That May Be a Detriment to Your Investment
 
During the second half of 2008, losses at brokers, banks and other financial sector companies as well as extreme volatility and disruptions in the credit markets globally led to extensive and unprecedented governmental intervention in worldwide financial markets. Such intervention was in certain cases implemented on an “emergency” basis, subjecting market participants without notice to a set of regulations which were in some cases unclear in scope and in application.
 
The trading advisor believes that it is possible that emergency intervention may take place again in the future. The trading advisor also believes that the regulation of financial markets is likely to be increased in the future. It is impossible to predict the impact of any such intervention and/or increased regulation on the performance of the Fund or the fulfillment of its investment objectives.

The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Reform Act”)
 
In response to the financial crises of 2008, the Obama Administration and the U.S. Congress proposed sweeping reform of the U.S. financial regulatory system. After over a year of debate, the Reform Act became law in July 2010. The Reform Act seeks to regulate markets, market participants and financial instruments that previously have been unregulated and substantially alters the regulation of many other markets, market participants and financial instruments. Because many provisions of the Reform Act require rulemaking by the applicable regulators before becoming fully effective and the Reform Act mandates multiple agency reports and studies (which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action), it is difficult to predict the impact of the Reform Act on the Fund, Campbell & Company, and the markets in which it trades and invests. The Reform Act could result in certain investment strategies in which the Fund engages or may have otherwise engaged becoming non-viable or non-economic to implement. The Reform Act and regulations adopted pursuant to the Reform Act could have a material adverse impact on the profit potential of the Fund. See also "Speculative Position Limits," “ Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets” and "Swap Agreements" below.
 
The Fund is Subject to Regulatory Risk Associated with Futures Contracts that Could Adversely Affect the Fund’s Operations and Profitability
 
On October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted regulations that impose new federal position limits on futures and options on metals, agricultural commodities and energy futures contracts such as crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, gasoline and other energy products. We do not anticipate that these limits will affect the Fund’s ability to trade, but it is possible that they may in the future if the Fund’s assets increase dramatically.
 
The Fund is a Party to Financial Instruments with Elements of Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Which May Cause the Fund to Lose All of Its Assets
 
The term “off-balance sheet risk” refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and forward contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Fund, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Fund at the same time, and if the Fund’s trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Fund, the Fund could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a 100% loss. Campbell & Company, Inc., the general partner (who also acts as trading advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30%; however, these precautions may not be effective in limiting the risk of loss.
 
Trading Risks
 
There are Disadvantages to Making Trading Decisions Based Primarily on Technical Market Data
 
The trading systems used by Campbell & Company for the Fund is primarily technical. The profitability of trading under these systems depends on, among other things, the occurrence of significant price movements, up or down, in futures or forward prices. Such price movements may not develop; there have been periods in the past without such price movements.
 
The likelihood of the Units being profitable could be materially diminished during periods when events external to the markets themselves have an important impact on prices. During such periods, Campbell & Company’s historic price analysis could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such events.
 
Increased Competition from Other Trend-Following Traders Could Reduce Campbell & Company’s Profitability
 
There has been a dramatic increase in the volume of assets managed by trend-following trading systems like some of the Campbell & Company programs. For example, in 1980, the assets in the managed futures industry were estimated at approximately $300 million; as of the third quarter of 2011, this estimate had risen to approximately $320.3 billion. Increased trading competition from other trend-following traders could operate to the detriment of the Fund. It may become more difficult for the Fund to implement its trading strategies if other trading advisors using technical systems are, at the same time, also attempting to initiate or liquidate futures or forward positions, or otherwise alter trading patterns.

Speculative Position Limits
 
The CFTC and certain exchanges have established position limits on the maximum net long or short futures positions which any person or group of persons acting in concert may hold or control in particular futures contracts. The CFTC has adopted a rule generally requiring each domestic U.S. exchange to set speculative position limits, subject to CFTC approval, for all futures contracts traded on exchanges which are not already subject to speculative position limits established by the CFTC or such exchange. The CFTC has jurisdiction to establish speculative position limits with respect to all futures contracts traded on exchanges located in the United States, and any such exchange may impose additional limits on positions on that exchange. Generally, no speculative position limits are in effect with respect to the trading of forward contracts or trading on non-U.S. exchanges. All trading accounts owned or managed by Campbell & Company acting on behalf of the Fund, its respective principals and affiliates are aggregated for calculating compliance with speculative position limits. Because futures position limits allow a commodity trading advisor and its principals to control only a limited number of contracts in any one commodity, Campbell & Company and its principals are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all accounts it controls because they are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts. Although Campbell & Company may be able to achieve the same performance results with OTC substitutes for futures contracts, the OTC market may be subject to differing prices, lesser liquidity and greater counterparty credit risks than the regulated U.S. commodities exchanges. Campbell & Company may in the future reduce the size of the positions which would otherwise be taken or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the Fund in order to avoid exceeding such limits. Modification of such trades that would otherwise be made by Campbell & Company, if required,  could adversely affect the Fund’s operations and profitability. Such modification, if required, could require the Fund to liquidate certain positions more rapidly than might otherwise be desirable, and could adversely affect the performance of the Fund. A violation of speculative position limits by the Fund could lead to regulatory action materially adverse to the Fund’s prospects for profitability.
 
On October 18, 2011, the CFTC adopted regulations that imposed new federal speculative position limits for futures and options on certain energy, metal and agricultural commodities, and economically equivalent swaps. Such speculative position limits may apply to traders engaged in trading that is neither for bona fide hedging nor swap dealer risk management purposes. The rules concerning speculative position limits may be amended in a manner that is detrimental to the Fund. For example, if the amended rules are detrimental to the Fund, the Fund’s ability to invest in additional commodity futures contracts or economically equivalent swaps may be limited to the extent these activities would cause the Fund to exceed the applicable speculative position limits.
 
Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets
 
The Reform Act includes provisions that comprehensively regulate the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets for the first time.
 
The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of OTC derivatives must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses. OTC trades submitted for clearing will be subject to minimum initial and variation margin requirements set by the relevant clearinghouse, as well as possible SEC- or CFTC-mandated margin requirements. The regulators also have broad discretion to impose margin requirements on non-cleared OTC derivatives and new requirements will apply to the holding of customer collateral by OTC derivatives dealers. These requirements may increase the amount of collateral the Fund is required to provide and the costs associated with providing it. Although the Reform Act includes limited exemptions from the clearing and margin requirements for so-called “end-users,” the Fund will not qualify to rely on such exemptions. In addition, the OTC derivative dealers with which the Fund executes the majority of its OTC derivatives will not be able to rely on the end-user exemptions under the Reform Act and therefore such OTC derivatives will be subject to mandatory clearing and the dealers will be subject to margin requirements irrespective of whether the Fund is subject to such requirements. OTC derivative dealers also will be required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customers’ trades instead of using such margin in their operations as is currently permitted. This will increase the OTC derivative dealers’ costs, and these increased costs are expected to be passed through to other market participants in the form of higher upfront and mark-to-market margin, less favorable trade pricing, and the possible imposition of new or increased fees.
 
 
8
 
The SEC and CFTC, as applicable, may also require a substantial portion of derivative transactions that are currently executed on a bi-lateral basis in the OTC markets to be executed through a regulated securities, futures, or swap exchange or execution facility. Such requirements may make it more difficult and costly for investment funds, including the Fund, to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions. They may also render certain strategies in which the Fund might otherwise engage impossible or so costly that they will no longer be economical to implement.
 
OTC derivative dealers and major OTC derivatives market participants will be required to register with the SEC and/or CFTC. The Fund or Campbell & Company may be required to register as major participants in the OTC derivatives markets. Dealers and major participants will be subject to minimum capital and margin requirements. These requirements may apply irrespective of whether the OTC derivatives in question are exchange-traded or cleared. OTC derivatives dealers will also be subject to new business conduct standards, disclosure requirements, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, transparency requirements, position limits, limitations on conflicts of interest, and other regulatory burdens. These requirements may further increase the overall costs for OTC derivative dealers, which costs are also likely to be passed along to market participants. The overall impact of the Reform Act on the Fund is highly uncertain and it is unclear how the OTC derivatives markets will adapt to this new regulatory regime.
 
In addition, Congress has considered imposing, and may in the future impose, restrictions on trading credit default swaps and other derivatives, including, potentially, a ban on trading these instruments except for the purpose of insuring a physically held position.
 
Swap Agreements
 
The Fund may enter into swap agreements. Swap agreements are privately negotiated over-the-counter derivative products in which two parties agree to exchange actual or contingent payment streams that may be calculated in relation to a rate, index, instrument, or certain securities, and a particular “notional amount.” Swaps may be subject to various types of risk, including market risk, liquidity risk, structuring risk, tax risk, and the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, including risks relating to the financial soundness and creditworthiness of the counterparty. Swaps can be individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types of investments or market factors. Depending on their structure, swaps may increase or decrease the Fund’s exposure to commodity prices, equity or debt securities, long-term or short-term interest rates (in the United States or abroad), non-U.S. currency values, mortgage-backed securities, corporate borrowing rates, or other factors such as security prices, baskets of securities, or inflation rates and may increase or decrease the overall volatility of the Fund’s portfolio. Swap agreements can take many different forms and are known by a variety of names. The Fund is not limited to any particular form of swap agreement if Campbell & Company determines the other forms are consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and policies. A significant factor in the performance of swaps is the change in individual commodity values, specific interest rates, currency values, or other factors that determine the amounts of payments due to and from the counterparties. If a swap calls for payments by the Fund, the Fund must have sufficient cash availability to make such payments when due. In addition, if a counterparty’s creditworthiness declines, the value of the swap agreement would be likely to decline, potentially resulting in losses to the Fund. The Reform Act mandates that a substantial portion of swap transactions must be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing to regulated clearinghouses. While these provisions are intended in part to reduce counterparty credit risk related to swap transactions, the Reform Act’s success in this regard will depend on the implementation of many rules and regulations, a process that may take several years.
 
Increase in Assets Under Management May Make Profitable Trading More Difficult
 
Campbell & Company has not agreed to limit the amount of additional equity which it may manage, and is actively engaged in raising assets for existing and new accounts. The more equity Campbell & Company manages, the more difficult it may be for Campbell & Company to trade profitably  because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance. Accordingly, such increases in equity under management may require Campbell & Company to modify its trading decisions for the Fund which could have a detrimental effect on your investment. Such considerations may also cause Campbell & Company to eliminate smaller markets from consideration for inclusion in its Trend Following Portfolio, reducing the range of markets in which trading opportunities may be pursued. Campbell & Company reserves the right to make distributions of profits to limited partners in an effort to control asset growth. In addition, Campbell & Company may have an incentive to favor other accounts because the compensation received from some other accounts may exceed the compensation it receives from managing the Fund’s account. Because records with respect to other accounts are not accessible to limited partners in the Fund, the limited partners will not be able to determine if Campbell & Company is favoring other accounts.

Investors Will Not be Able to View the Fund’s Holdings on a Daily Basis, Which May Result in Unanticipated Losses
 
Campbell & Company makes the Fund’s trading decisions. While Campbell & Company receives daily trade confirmations from the futures broker and over-the-counter counterparty, the Fund’s trading results are reported to limited partners monthly. Accordingly, an investment in the Fund does not offer limited partners the same transparency, i.e. , an ability to review all investment positions daily, that a personal trading account offers. As a result, you may suffer unanticipated losses due to the Fund’s holdings.
 
Tax Risks
 
Investors are Taxed Based on Their Share of the Fund’s Profits
 
Investors are taxed each year on their share of the Fund’s profits, if any, irrespective of whether they redeem any Units or receive any cash distributions from the Fund. Campbell & Company has the authority to make such distributions at any time in its sole discretion.
 
All performance information included herein is presented on a pre-tax basis; the investors who experienced such performance had to pay the related taxes from other sources.
 
Tax Could be Due from Investors on Their Share of the Fund’s Ordinary Income Despite Overall Losses
 
Investors may be required to pay tax on their allocable share of the Fund’s ordinary income, which in the case of the Fund is the Fund’s interest income, gain on some foreign futures contracts, and certain other investment assets, even though the Fund incurs overall losses. Capital losses of individual taxpayers can be used only to offset capital gains and $3,000 of ordinary income each year. Consequently, if an individual investor were allocated $5,000 of ordinary income and $10,000 of capital losses, the investor would owe tax on $2,000 of ordinary income even though the investor would have a $5,000 loss for the year. The remaining $7,000 capital loss could be used in subsequent years to offset capital gain and ordinary income, but subject to the same annual limitation on its deductibility against ordinary income.
 
There Could be a Limit on the Deductibility of Brokerage and Performance Fees
 
Although the Fund treats the brokerage fees and performance fees paid to Campbell & Company and other expenses of the Fund as ordinary and necessary business expenses, upon an IRS audit the Fund may be required to treat such fees as “investment advisory fees” if the Fund’s trading activities did not constitute a trade or business for tax purposes. If the limited partner’s share of expenses were deemed to be investment advisory fees, a limited partner’s tax liability would likely increase because of statutory limitations applicable to miscellaneous itemized deductions, including investment advisory fees, of individual taxpayers. In addition, upon audit, a portion of the brokerage fees might be treated as a non-deductible syndication cost or might be treated as a reduction in the Fund’s capital gain or as an increase in the Fund’s capital loss. If the brokerage fees were so treated, a limited partner’s tax liability would likely increase.
 
Other Risks
 
Fees and Commissions are Charged Regardless of Profitability and are Subject to Change
 
The Fund is subject to substantial charges payable irrespective of profitability, in addition to performance fees which are payable based on the Fund’s profitability. Included in these charges are brokerage fees and operating expenses. On the Fund’s forward trading, “bid-ask” spreads are incorporated into the pricing of the Fund’s forward contracts by the counterparties in addition to the brokerage fees paid  by the Fund. It is not possible to quantify the “bid-ask” spreads paid by the Fund because the Fund cannot determine the profit its counterparty is making on the forward transactions. Such spreads can at times be significant. In addition, while currently not contemplated, the Limited Partnership Agreement allows for changes to be made to the brokerage fee and performance fee upon sixty days’ notice to the limited partners.

The Fund’s Service Providers Could Fail, Which May Result in Losses to the Fund
 
The institutions with which the Fund trades or invests may encounter financial difficulties that impair the operational capabilities or the capital position of the Fund. A futures broker is generally required by U.S. law to segregate all funds received from such broker’s customers from such broker’s proprietary assets. If the futures broker does not do so to the full extent required by law, the assets of the Fund might not be fully protected in the event of the bankruptcy of the futures broker. Furthermore, in the event of the futures broker’s bankruptcy, the Fund could lose the entire amount, or be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the futures broker’s combined customer accounts, even though certain property specifically traceable to the Fund (for example, Treasury bills deposited by the Fund with the futures broker as margin) was held by the futures broker. Furthermore, dealers in forward contracts are not regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act and are not obligated to segregate customer assets. The futures brokers have been the subject of regulatory and private causes of action.
 
Although the trading advisor regularly monitors the financial condition of the counterparties it uses, if one or more of the Fund’s counterparties were to become insolvent or the subject of liquidation proceedings in the United States (either under the Securities Investor Protection Act or the United States Bankruptcy Code), there exists the risk that the recovery of the Fund’s assets from such counterparty will be delayed or be of a value less than the value of the assets originally entrusted to such counterparty.
 
Investors Must Not Rely on the Past Performance of Either Campbell & Company or the Fund in Deciding Whether to Retain Units
 
The future performance of the Fund is not predictable, and no assurance can be given that the Fund will perform successfully in the future in as much as past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Additionally, the markets in which the Fund operates have been severely disrupted over the past year or more, so results observed in earlier periods may have little relevance to the results observable in the current environment.
 
Conflicts of Interest Exist in the Structure and Operation of the Fund
 
Campbell & Company has not established any formal procedures to resolve the following conflicts of interest. Consequently, there is no independent control over how Campbell & Company resolves these conflicts which can be relied upon by investors as ensuring that the Fund is treated equitably with other Campbell & Company clients.
 
Campbell & Company has a conflict of interest because it acts as the general partner and sole trading advisor for the Fund.
 
Since Campbell & Company acts as both trading advisor and general partner for the Fund, it is very unlikely that its advisory contract will be terminated by the Fund. The fees payable to Campbell & Company were established by it and were not the subject of arm’s-length negotiation. These fees consist of a (i) monthly brokerage fee of 7% of the Fund's month-end net asset value per annum (prior to accruals for such brokerage fee or performance fees) (of which, 3% is retained by Campbell & Company) and (ii) a quarterly performance fee equal to 20% of aggregate cumulative appreciation in Fund's net asset value per Unit, if any, excluding interest income and as adjusted for redemptions. Campbell & Company, as general partner, determines whether or not distributions are made and it receives increased fees to the extent distributions are not made.
 
Subject to the limit on selling agent compensation, selling agents will be entitled to ongoing compensation as a result of their clients remaining in the Fund, so a conflict exists between the selling agent’s interest in maximizing compensation and in advising its clients to make investment decisions in the client’s best interests.
 
11
 
There Are No Independent Experts Representing Investors
 
Campbell & Company has consulted with counsel, accountants and other experts regarding the formation and operation of the Fund. No counsel has been appointed to represent the limited partners in connection with the offering of the Units. Accordingly, each prospective investor should consult his own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in the Fund.
 
The Fund Places Significant Reliance on Campbell & Company and the Incapacity of its Principals Could Adversely Affect the Fund
 
The incapacity of Campbell & Company’s principals could have a material and adverse effect on Campbell & Company’s ability to discharge its obligations under the advisory agreement. However, there are no individual principals at Campbell & Company whose absence would result in a material and adverse effect on Campbell & Company’s ability to adequately carry out its advisory responsibilities.
 
The Fund Could Terminate Before You Achieve Your Investment Objective Causing Potential Loss of Your Investment or Disrupting Your Investment Portfolio
 
As general partner of the Fund, Campbell & Company may withdraw from the Fund upon 120 days’ notice, which would cause that Fund to terminate unless a substitute general partner were obtained. Other events, such as a long-term substantial loss suffered by the Fund, could also cause the Fund to terminate before the expiration of its stated term. This could cause you to liquidate your investments and disrupt the overall maturity and timing of your investment portfolio. If the registrations with the CFTC or memberships in the NFA of Campbell & Company or the futures broker were revoked or suspended, such entity would no longer be able to provide services to the Fund.
 
The Fund is Not a Regulated Investment Company and is Therefore Subject to Different Protections Than a Regulated Investment Company
 
Although the Fund and Campbell & Company are subject to regulation by the CFTC, the Fund is not an investment company subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Campbell & Company is not registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Accordingly, you do not have the protections afforded by those statutes which, for example, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the adviser and the investment company.
 
Hybrids and Other Derivatives are Not Subject to CFTC Regulation; Therefore, the Fund Will Not Receive the Same Protections on These Transactions
 
The Fund may trade hybrid instruments and other off-exchange contracts. Hybrids are instruments which combine features of a security with those of a futures contract. There is no exchange or clearinghouse for these contracts and they are not regulated by the CFTC. The Fund will not receive the protections which are provided by the CFTC’s regulatory scheme for these transactions.
 
 
12
 
The Fund is Subject to Foreign Market Credit and Regulatory Risk
 
A substantial portion of Campbell & Company’s trades takes place on markets or exchanges outside the United States. From time to time, over 50% of the Fund’s overall market exposure could involve positions taken on foreign markets. Such exchanges may include, but are not limited to: the Australian Securities Exchange, Hong Kong Futures Exchange, London Metal Exchange, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The risk of loss in trading foreign futures contracts can be substantial. Participation in foreign futures contracts transactions involves the execution and clearing of trades on, or subject to the rules of, a foreign board of trade. Non-U.S. markets may not be subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. None of the CFTC, NFA or any domestic exchange regulates activities of any foreign boards of trade, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, nor do they have the power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or any applicable foreign laws. Trading on foreign exchanges also presents the risks of exchange controls, expropriation, taxation and government disruptions.
 
The Fund is Subject to Foreign Exchange Risk
 
The price of any foreign futures contract and, therefore, the potential profit and loss thereon, may be affected by any variance in the foreign exchange rate between the time a position is established and the time it is liquidated, offset or exercised. Certain foreign exchanges may also be in a more or less developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics. In addition, the Fund may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign exchanges as do local traders, and the historical market data on which Campbell & Company bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is in the United States. The rights of clients (such as the Fund) in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non-U.S. market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of U.S. markets or brokers.
 
Transfers Could be Restricted
 
You may transfer or assign your Units only upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Campbell & Company and only if Campbell & Company is satisfied that the transfer complies with applicable laws and would not result in adverse legal or tax consequences for the Fund.
 
A Single-Advisor Fund May Be More Volatile Than a Multi-Advisor Fund
 
The Fund is a single-advisor managed futures fund. You should understand that certain managed futures funds are structured as multi-advisor funds in order to attempt to control risk and reduce volatility through combining advisors whose historical performance records have exhibited a significant degree of non-correlation with each other. As a single-advisor managed futures fund, the Fund may have increased performance volatility and a higher risk of loss than investment vehicles employing multiple advisors.
 
The Performance Fee Could be an Incentive to Make Riskier Investments
 
Campbell & Company employs speculative strategies for the Fund, and receives performance fees based on the trading profits earned by it for the Fund. Campbell & Company would not agree to manage the Fund’s accounts in the absence of such a performance fee arrangement. Accordingly, Campbell & Company may make investments that are riskier than might be made if the Fund’s assets were managed by a trading advisor that did not require performance-based compensation.
 
The Fund May Distribute Profits to Limited Partners at Inopportune Times
 
Campbell & Company reserves the right to make distributions of profits of the Fund to the limited partners at any time in its sole discretion in order to control the growth of the assets under Campbell & Company’s management. Limited partners will have no choice in receiving these distributions as income, and may receive little notice that these distributions are being made. Distributions may be made at an inopportune time for the limited partners.
 
 
13
 
Potential Inability to Trade or Report Due to Systems Failure Could Adversely Affect the Fund
 
Campbell & Company’s strategies are dependent to a significant degree on the proper functioning of its internal computer systems. Accordingly, systems failures, whether due to third party failures upon which such systems are dependent or the failure of Campbell & Company’s hardware or software, could disrupt trading or make trading impossible until such failure is remedied. Any such failure, and consequential inability to trade (even for a short time), could, in certain market conditions, cause the Fund to experience significant trading losses or to miss opportunities for profitable trading. Additionally, any such failures could cause a temporary delay in reports to investors.
 
Failure to Receive Timely and Accurate Market Data from Third Party Vendors Could Cause Disruptions or the Inability to Trade
 
Campbell & Company’s strategies are dependent to a significant degree on the receipt of timely and accurate market data from third party vendors. Accordingly, the failure to receive such data in a timely manner or the receipt of inaccurate data, whether due to the acts or omissions of such third party vendors or otherwise, could disrupt trading to the detriment of the Fund or make trading impossible until such failure or inaccuracy is remedied. Any such failure or inaccuracy could, in certain market conditions, cause the Fund to experience significant trading losses, effect trades in a manner which it otherwise would not have done, or miss opportunities for profitable trading. For example, the receipt of inaccurate market data may cause the Fund to establish (or exit) a position which it otherwise would not have established (or exited), or fail to establish (or exit) a position which it otherwise would have established (or exited), and any subsequent correction of such inaccurate data may cause the Fund to reverse such action or inaction, all of which may ultimately be to the detriment of the Fund.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Introduction
 
The offering of its Units of Limited Partnership Interest commenced on January 12, 1994. The initial offering terminated on April 15, 1994 and the Fund commenced operations on April 18, 1994. The continuing offering period commenced at the termination of the initial offering period and terminated on January 6, 2012.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. The Fund’s significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 of the Financial Statements.
 
The Fund records all investments at fair value in its financial statements, with changes in fair value reported as a component of realized and change in unrealized trading gain (loss) in the Statements of Operations. Generally, fair values are based on market prices; however, in certain circumstances, estimates are involved in determining fair value in the absence of an active market closing price (i.e., forward contracts which are traded in the inter-bank market).
 
Capital Resources
 
Effective January 6, 2012, units in the Fund were no longer offered for sale. For existing investors in the Fund, business has been and will be conducted as usual. There will be no change in trading, operations or monthly statements, etc., and redemptions will continue to be offered on a monthly basis.
 
The Fund does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature of the Fund’s business, it will make no capital expenditures and will have no capital assets, which are not operating capital or assets.
 
The Fund maintains 40-80% of its net asset value in cash, cash equivalents or other liquid positions in its cash management program over and above that needed to post as collateral for trading. These funds are available to meet redemptions each month. After redemptions are taken into account each month, the trade level of the Fund is adjusted and positions in the instruments the Fund trades are liquidated, if necessary, on a pro-rata basis to meet those increases or decreases in trade levels.

Liquidity
 
Most United States commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in the prices of futures contracts during a single day by regulations referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” or “daily limits.” During a single trading day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has reached the daily limit for that day, positions in that contract can neither be taken nor liquidated. Futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Similar occurrences could prevent the Fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and subject the Fund to substantial losses which could exceed the margin initially committed to such trades. In addition, even if futures prices have not moved the daily limit, the Fund may not be able to execute futures trades at favorable prices, if little trading in such contracts is taking place. Other than these limitations on liquidity, which are inherent in the Fund’s futures trading operations, the Fund’s assets are expected to be highly liquid.
 
The entire offering proceeds, without deductions, were credited to the Fund’s bank, brokerage and/or cash management accounts. The Fund meets margin requirements for its trading activities by depositing cash or U.S. government securities with the futures brokers and the over-the-counter counterparties. This does not reduce the risk of loss from trading futures and forward contracts. The Fund receives all interest earned on its assets. No other person shall receive any interest or other economic benefits from the deposit of Fund assets.
 
Approximately 10% to 30% of the Fund’s assets normally are committed as required margin for futures contracts and held by the futures brokers, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury bills in segregated accounts with the futures brokers pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and regulations thereunder. Approximately 10% to 30% of the Fund’s assets are deposited with over-the-counter counterparties in order to initiate and maintain forward contracts. Such assets are not held in segregation or otherwise regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, unless such over-the-counter counterparty is registered as a futures commission merchant. These assets are held either in U.S. government securities or short-term time deposits with U.S.-regulated bank affiliates of the over-the-counter counterparties.
 
The general partner deposits the majority of those assets of the Fund that are not required to be deposited as margin with the futures brokers and over-the-counter counterparties in custodial accounts with Northern Trust Company. The assets deposited in the custodial accounts with Northern Trust Company are segregated. Such custodial accounts constitute approximately 40% to 80% of the Fund’s assets and are invested directly by Horizon Cash Management LLC (“Horizon”). Horizon is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Horizon does not guarantee any interest or profits will accrue on the Fund’s assets in the custodial account. Horizon will invest according to agreed upon investment guidelines that are modeled after those investments allowed by the futures broker as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act, Title 17, Part 1, § 1.25 Investment of customer funds. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; and (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt.
 
The Fund occasionally receives margin calls (requests to post more collateral) from its futures brokers or over-the-counter counterparties, which are met by moving the required portion of the assets held in the custody accounts at Northern Trust to the margin accounts. In the past three years, the Fund has not needed to liquidate any position as a result of a margin call.
 
The Fund’s assets are not and will not be, directly or indirectly, commingled with the property of any other person in violation of law or invested in or loaned to Campbell & Company or any affiliated entities.

Off-Balance Sheet Risk
 
The term “off-balance sheet risk” refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation or loss. The Fund trades in futures and forward contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a risk to the Fund, market risk, that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the futures interests positions of the Fund at the same time, and if the Fund’s trading advisor was unable to offset futures interests positions of the Fund, the Fund could lose all of its assets and the Limited Partners would realize a 100% loss. Campbell & Company, Inc., the general partner (who also acts as trading advisor), minimizes market risk through real-time monitoring of open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30%.
 
In addition to market risk, in entering into futures and forward contracts there is a credit risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to the Fund. The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the United States and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.
 
In the case of forward contracts, which are traded on the interbank market rather than on exchanges, the counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a group of financial institutions; thus there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. Campbell & Company trades for the Fund only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of the Fund are valued each day at fair value. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able to meet its obligations to the Fund.
 
Disclosures About Certain Trading Activities that Include Non-Exchange Traded Contracts Accounted for at Fair Value
 
The Fund invests in futures and forward currency contracts. Prior to September 2011, the Fund also invested in options on forward currency contracts. The fair value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward (non-exchange traded) contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) of the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of option (non-exchange traded) contracts is calculated by applying an industry-standard adaptation of the Black-Scholes options valuation model to foreign currency options, using as inputs, the spot prices, interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period.

Results of Operations
 
The returns for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were (7.61)%, 9.04%, and (8.96)%, respectively. The following is a discussion of the brokerage and performance fees accrued and paid. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Fund accrued brokerage fees in the amount of $87,233,861, 103,070,192 and $144,756,816, respectively, and paid brokerage fees in the amounts of $90,074,141, $104,878,190 and $149,311,800, respectively. No performance fees were accrued or paid during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
 
2011 (For the Year Ended December 31)
 
Of the (7.61)% return for the year, approximately (0.04)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (7.92)% was due to brokerage fees, operating expenses and offering costs borne by the Fund, offset by approximately 0.35% due to investment income .

2011 started with global equities trending higher, fueled by improving U.S. labor market conditions, a “pro-business” move toward the center by President Obama, stronger corporate earnings and a general rotation from fixed income into stocks. The Fund’s long equity positions made the sector the best performer for the month of January, in the face of such a rising global equity environment. Commodity trading also produced gains for the month of January from the Fund’s long positions in agricultural and energy contracts. A number of energy contracts reached 24 month highs on strong global demand due to a number of factors, including, cold weather in the U.S. / U.K. and civil unrest in the Middle East. Cotton started 2011 up over 16% for the month of January on surging demand from the world’s biggest consumer, China. Currency trading on the month proved difficult as the Fund’s short position in the U.S. Dollar generated losses as emerging market risk aversion may have been prompted by the Egyptian anti-government protests. Additional losses were recorded in the fixed income markets from the Fund’s long position in short-term European rates. The bond market was choppy during the first part of January until concerns were raised about Euro-zone inflation, contributing to a sell-off in short-term rates as market participants began pricing in future rate hikes.
 
In February, geopolitical concerns, centering on the growing Middle East/North African ("MENA") populist uprising, may have negatively affected the commodity markets. This regional tension may have generated significant price movements in the energy sector fueling gains for the Fund. Precious Metals, including gold and silver, were also strong contributors, along with soft commodities such as cotton (+17% during February) and coffee as they continued their upward trends. Additional gains were recorded in equity trading due partially to improving macroeconomic data supporting the global recovery theme. While some of the major currencies rallied during the month, others like the New Zealand Dollar fell significantly on the devastation of a massive earthquake in the Christchurch region. In the aggregate, currency trading was marginally positive on the month for the Fund. Fixed Income trading finished slightly negative as price action was choppy across the globe, mainly from better economic data in the early part of the month followed by risk aversion in the second half of February.

The “V–shaped” behavior in most sectors during March may have been caused by global stock market volatility compounded by the devastating earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan, followed by upside surprises to manufacturing data and other economic activity as the month came to a close. Global stock markets experienced significant volatility as the MENA unrest and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis both worsened prior to the crisis in Japan that concluded with threats of a nuclear reactor emergency. While the Nikkei finished down approximately 8% for March, the U.S. stock market was relatively unchanged despite large mid-month swings. The Fund’s models adjusted to the abrupt price swings by reducing long equity exposure over 50% (region specific) by mid-month across the U.S., Europe and Asia. Stock indices trading was the worst performing sector for March. Commodities were negatively impacted by base metal prices. Gains from long positions in energies and precious metals were not enough to overcome losses in nickel, copper and corn. Currency trading also proved challenging as Central Banks intervened in response to excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates that may have been perceived as having adverse implications for economic and financial stability. In particular, the Fund’s short position in the Japanese Yen suffered as a result of the repatriation of Yen back to Japan. While risk exposures were light in fixed income trading, small losses were incurred in both short-term and long-term rates due to choppy market price action.
 
While March’s volatile markets were highlighted by the events in Japan, April’s theme revolved mostly around a persistently weaker U.S. Dollar coupled with a “risk on” appetite in global stock markets. Irrespective of the continued unrest in MENA, Goldman Sachs’ warning that the commodities boom may be running out of steam and oil at multi-year highs, the bulls prevailed on relatively strong M&A activity, a strong start to the earnings season, and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s continued pledge to keep interest rates low for an “extended period.” The U.S. Dollar Index experienced its largest monthly decline since September of last year as the Federal Reserves Chairman Ben Bernanke maintained an accommodative stance in the U.S., while the European Central Bank raised rates to fight inflation. Additional downward pressure came in the form of an S&P downgrade, mid-month, to the U.S. long-term credit outlook. The Fund recorded gains in the currency sector, particularly against the Swiss Franc and commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian Dollar and the New Zealand Dollar. Commodity trading also produced substantial gains as geopolitics contributed to a strong rally in the petroleum complex. Precious metals were also solid performers as Silver came close to its all-time high when the Hunt brothers attempted to corner the market in 1980. In Stock Indices, the Fund generally increased its net long exposure as bullish trends apparently reasserted themselves following a chaotic March, while only maintaining a marginal short exposure in Japan.  Trading in fixed income yielded flat results as gains in long positions were offset by losses from short positions.
 
The petroleum complex sold off substantially on May 5th, despite the lack of any oil-related fundamental data. In addition, precious metals saw a significant decline with the price of silver dropping 24%, giving back the entire April rally. While the Fund suffered losses in these sectors, our models significantly reduced long commodity exposure on the abrupt reversal in price action and spike in volatility throughout the month. Trading in global equities also generated losses on softer economic data, Wall Street lowering U.S. growth forecasts, and renewed European sovereign debt concerns mainly focused on Greece. While positions have been reduced in this sector, regional risk was apparently rotated out of Europe and back to the U.S. Losses were also recorded in currency trading as the U.S. Dollar rallied against most major currencies. The Fund's long Euro position produced the biggest currency loss, as the European Central Bank disappointed expectations of rate hikes at its May policy meeting. Fixed income trading produced strong positive results, helping to mitigate losses in riskier assets as the flight-to-quality theme was dominant in May.
 
The Greek debt crisis continued to influence price movement in June, leading to the eventual passage of an austerity plan at month-end. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, which continued to expect that economic conditions were likely to warrant exceptionally low interest rates for an extended period, gave no hint of a new “QE3” program. Commodity trading was difficult in June, particularly in the energy complex, as prices continued to fall from late April/early May highs. Factors such as concerns about the European sovereign debt crisis, discord with OPEC, and an unexpected and controversial use of U.S. and European strategic petroleum reserves by the IEA (International Energy Agency) and the DOE (Department of Energy) weighed heavily on prices. Additional losses were recorded in precious and base metals. Trading in global equities also produced negative results as stock markets around the world declined on Greek debt concerns and weak economic data. While the Fund’s models generally reduced overall long stock index exposure throughout the month, concentrations remained in the U.S. and Europe with mixed positioning in Asia. Certain risky assets rallied and bond prices fell across the globe during the last few days of the month after the austerity package in Greece was finally passed. Small losses were recorded in fixed income trading, particularly on the short-end of the curve. Foreign exchange markets were largely unchanged in June, despite headlines that may have caused the currency markets to fluctuate intra-month. The Fund continued to maintain a short U.S. Dollar exposure versus most major currencies.

During the month of July, the markets were affected by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in both Europe and the U.S. As risky assets suffered, certain bond prices were increased partially from investors flocking to the relative safety of fixed income, yielding strong gains for the Fund’s global long position. While U.S. Treasuries finished the month up over 2%, U.K. Gilts finished up 4%, German Bunds were up 3.5%, Japanese Bonds closed up 5% and Canadian Bonds increased by 2.5%. Additional gains were recorded in foreign exchange trading as the U.S. Dollar continued its downward trend against most major currencies. The U.S. Dollar, in particular, fell to new all-time lows against the Swiss Franc and the New Zealand Dollar, some of the best performing markets for the Fund in July. Commodity trading for the Fund was also strongly positive in July, particularly from precious metals, as safe-haven buying supported prices in gold and silver. Additional profits came from soft commodities as sugar continued its upward trend, gaining 12% in July, on signs that Brazil’s production would not match expectations. The base metals and energy sector yielded small gains, while grains yielded small losses. The stock index sector was the Fund's only losing sector during the month as European sovereign debt remained a concern, economic data was mixed to weaker–than-expected, and the U.S. debt-ceiling and deficit-reduction debate took center stage. While the Fund reduced net long exposure in Europe, position exposure increased in the Pacific Rim and in North America.
 
August experienced significant volatility stemming mainly from the S&P downgrade of the United States Triple-A credit rating after weeks of contentious political debate. Strong gains in fixed income were recorded during the month as risk appetite diminished sending yields in both the U.S. and European fixed income markets lower. However, the reduction in risk appetite may have been a primary driver for losses in currency trading, stock indices and commodities. As a consequence of market volatility, European Union regulators implemented restrictions on short selling in various stock indices. The Fund’s trading is also subject to these restrictions and appropriate action was taken to be in compliance. While the Fund was still able to short certain stock index contracts in Europe, others have been temporarily removed from the portfolio. The Fund continued to take advantage of stock market volatility (indirectly) through trading in currencies, bonds and commodities.
 
The markets seemed to be in risk aversion mode in September as the pressure of implementing fiscal austerity in the Eurozone continued. Negative sentiment in macroeconomic growth may have increased fears of recessions and may have overwhelmed some tentative signs of optimism. The Fund benefited from higher bond prices. Equity Indices also yielded gains in the Fund, primarily from short positions in Europe and Asia as stocks globally finished lower. These gains were not enough to offset losses experienced in the other sectors. Risk assets struggled during the month while the U.S. Dollar which was up nearly 6% for the month. The Fund, having been positioned with the prevailing trend of a weaker U.S. Dollar, recorded its largest losses in the Foreign Exchange sector as a result of the U.S. Dollar's rally. The Fund’s models adjusted positioning in response to the rally; however, the losses in this sector were difficult to offset. Commodities amplified the theme of bearish global macroeconomic conditions resulting in overall losses in the sector for the Fund. Precious metals reversed significantly, with nearly a 28% decline in silver and 11% in gold, perhaps implying deflation was on the horizon. Base metal positions helped dampen losses from energy trading, despite certain shorts during the month.
 
Global risk appetite seemed to improve throughout the month of October as market participants became more optimistic that progress could be achieved in managing the European debt crisis. The turn-around was impressive when considering some markets rallied 20% from their low points. While the Euro rallied relative to the U.S. Dollar during the month, the biggest shock to the system seemed to be the Bank of Japan intervention at month end. The Dollar's significant rally against the Yen caused the Yen to be the only G20 currency with a negative performance against the Dollar on the month. Outside of Europe, economic data improved, thus diminishing some of the global recessionary concerns. A more resilient economy, coupled with expectations of progress in the Eurozone may have supported the global equity markets and commodity prices. While losses in equity indices and fixed income trading were marginal, volatility was elevated in the commodity markets at large, generating losses to the Fund. While aggregate long positions in precious metals were marginally accretive, short positions in the base metals were responsible for the overall loss in the commodities sector, with copper prices rising over 15%. On the last day of the month, the rally unwound and the tide began to change largely due to a call for a referendum on the recently negotiated EU agreement and a confidence vote by the Greek Prime Minister. Choppy markets with high volatility created difficulty for trend-following models.

Primary catalysts for the mid-November sell-off in equity prices may have been influenced by the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe, negative news out of China, and the U.S. deficit-reduction “super committee’s” failure to reach an agreement. The late month rally may have been influenced by better than expected U.S. holiday shopping results, a globally coordinated central bank liquidity action, and optimistic reports of economic data in the U.S.  While Trend-Following strategies cannot typically manage intra-day and intra-week fluctuations in price action well, the Fund’s model diversity across time horizon and across market segments may have dampened larger potential market losses for the month. In equity indices trading, early in the month the Fund’s longs in the U.S. and Europe were offset by shorts in Asia. As the month progressed, significant volatility in global equity markets may have caused the Fund’s models to contract and adjust their positioning, leaving marginal room to take advantage of the impromptu rally at month-end. While fixed income trading was strongly positive throughout the month, the risk asset rally at month end may have generated an abrupt fixed income sell-off, thus diminishing gains from the Fund’s long bond positioning in the sector. A similar phenomenon occurred in the currency sector as the U.S. Dollar rally may have caused the Fund’s models to increase their long positioning, only to see an unexpected policy decision negatively influence the U.S. Dollar in the last days of the month. Commodity prices also experienced volatility. The Fund’s short positioning in natural gas yielded substantial gains; however, the sector as a whole finished with losses coming primarily in precious metals. Trend-based systems need linear, directional volatility to profit. 
 
In December, political events continued to influence market price action, with the European Debt Crisis taking center stage. Fixed Income trading yielded strong gains during the month as the Fund’s long positions globally helped close a strong year for the sector. Fixed Income was one of the few sectors to exhibit relatively more pronounced price trend behavior throughout the year. Unfortunately for trend-following strategies in general, much of 2011 exhibited choppy and volatile price action in risk assets due to a number of political events that may have adversely impacted investor sentiment. Currency trading was also a significant contributor to gains on the month as the U.S. Dollar rallied against most of the majors, particularly against the Euro. That said, some significant reversals throughout the year left the Fund in negative territory on the year in foreign exchange. Price action in global equity markets was mixed and finished slightly negative on the month for the Fund and negative on the year. Mixed news out of Europe, generally better than expected U.S. economic data including strong holiday sales, and China’s pro-growth policy were all contributing factors to mixed results. Commodity prices experienced their first annual drop as a sector since 2008 and individual sub-sectors remained volatile, especifically Gold and Silver, losing 10-15% respectively. While commodity trading has been difficult for the Fund on the year, losses on the month were marginal as broad diversification in positioning and underlying risk exposure may have dampened volatility.
 
2010  (For the Year Ended December 31) 
 
Of the 9.04% return for the year, approximately 16.31% was due to trading gains (before commissions) and approximately 0.46% was due to investment income, offset by approximately (7.73)% due to brokerage fees, operating expenses and offering costs borne by the Fund. An analysis of the 16.31% trading gain by sector is as follows:

2010 began with an equity sell-off in the second half of the month as global confidence in a steady recovery, again, began to waver, resulting in trading losses for the Fund’s net long equity indices positions. Primary drivers were related to: (1) China’s efforts to manage growth; (2) questionable stability of the European Union as Greece potentially defaults on sovereign debt; and (3) the potential heavy-handed regulation of the U.S. banking system. As the global risk trade unwound, the Fund’s commodity positions also produced losses, largely in the energy complex and in base metals. The global negative news detracted from a relative positive earnings season and signs of improved economic data. Further losses were recorded in currency trading as the U.S. Dollar was, once again, seen as a safe haven as the economic health of several nations was called into question. Marginal gains were recorded in fixed income as we were able to benefit from the steepening of the yield curve as a result of short-term interest rates being kept at extremely low levels by global central banks.
 
The first half of February was somewhat subdued as the market digested mixed U.S. employment numbers versus the unemployment rate. By mid-month, the U.S. Federal Reserve surprised the markets by deciding to hike the discount rate, in a clear sign that the pace of their exit strategy may be more aggressive than originally anticipated. The Fund’s long positions in short-term rates, both in the U.S. and Europe, fueled strong gains in the sector for the remainder of the month. Gains were also recorded in currency trading as the Euro currency weakened against most majors on accelerated sovereign fears evidenced by the record high cost of insuring Greek and Portuguese debt. Global equity indices trading produced small losses for the Fund as a result of dealing with diverse global macroeconomic challenges (weakening Euro, China central bank intervention and U.S. employment and earnings season results). While the market finished generally negative in Europe and Asia, the U.S. managed to record a gain on largely upbeat fourth quarter earnings announcements with many S&P constituents beating consensus expectations. Commodity trading resulted in generally negative results as the structural imbalances in Europe, and the strong relative performance of the U.S. economy versus the Eurozone helped “de-link” Europe from the risk trade, keeping commodities in alignment with U.S. stocks. While energy prices rallied for most of the month, precious metals sold off early only to turn positive as the market used gold as a safe haven against Eurozone turmoil.
 
March proved to be a very strong month for trends as the Fund’s long positions in energies and base metals benefited from prices moving higher on climbing global economic growth prospects. Global equity indices also provided gains for the Fund’s long positions as prices surged on renewed merger and acquisition activity, positive news centered on economic releases, and subdued fears regarding Greece’s finances. Marginal gains were recorded in the foreign exchange markets as the return of the carry trade pushed commodity linked currencies higher. Almost all central banks have acknowledged that the worst has passed; however, the lack of flexibility to induce fresh fiscal or monetary stimulus has forced a lower for longer interest rate policy globally. The Fund’s net gains were partially offset by losses in the fixed income markets from long positions in U.S. Treasury futures as prices fell during the month. In the U.S. fixed income market, heavy supply put pressure on bond prices, and U.S. Treasury yields were higher than swap yields for the first time on record.
 
April performance was led by strong gains in the fixed income markets from long positions in Europe and from U.S. bond prices that moved higher during the month as the Greece sovereign debt concerns and fears of contagion played center stage in global markets. Currency trading also benefited from the sovereign debt fears and from perceived signs of positive economic growth beginning to materialize. Further gains were recorded in energy and precious metals, as energy markets continued its high correlation to the S&P and investor demand for precious metals continued to grow. Marginal losses were incurred in base metals trading as these markets moved lower on U.S. dollar strength. Global equity indices trading produced flat performance, with net longs across the board producing positive results in the U.S., negative results in Europe, and flat performance in Asia.
 
As European sovereign debt concerns persisted and China tightened credit in an attempt to cool overheating in its property sector, the decline in equity markets by the end of May was wide-spread across the U.S., Europe and Asia. The “flash crash” in the U.S. equities markets on May 6th added to the unsettling nature of equity market price behavior throughout the month. While the Fund experienced losses in equity indices, gains in fixed income help offset the flight from risky assets in favor of government debt. Commodity trading was difficult for the Fund, particularly in the Energy sector, as the complex fell in tandem with the equity markets until a late month bounce. While British Petroleum’s spill in the Gulf continued to flow uncontrollably, the disaster has not significantly affected the supply of oil into the U.S. to date. Along with the scare in Greece, the Euro came under pressure against the U.S. Dollar as comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke raised concerns over the Euro zone’s bank funding. The U.S. Dollar was, once again, viewed as a safe position trade as risk aversion, volatility and liquidity dominated currency markets contributing to gains in the foreign exchange sector for the Fund.

In June, another month of the “risk off” trade gave government bonds a bid, which produced healthy gains from long global fixed income positions. Unfortunately, these gains were offset by losses in equity indices, foreign exchange and commodities. Long equity positions suffered from an equity sell off, which primarily stemmed from weaker than expected U.S. and Chinese economic data, negative corporate news and interbank funding concerns in the European region. Foreign exchange trading generated losses primarily from the Fund’s short Swiss Franc position as the currency rallied 7% vs. the U.S. Dollar based on Swiss National Bank comments softening its intervention language. Commodity trading produced minimal losses, largely from our trading in natural gas futures which ended up 3.6% after finally breaking out of a three month range. The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has not been a significant factor on short-term price movements but most analysts agree that the real impact will be long-term as the cost of production is almost sure to go higher on the back of tighter regulation.
 
Catalysts for the equity rally in July hinged on strong economic data out of Europe, positive results from European bank stress tests and an increase in positive sentiment out of China. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones recorded gains of approximately 7% in July, adding another twist to their rollercoaster paths. Small gains were recorded in the European and U.S. equity markets from long positions in stock index futures as over-sold conditions paved the way for a reversal higher. Stocks rallied on better-than-expected second quarter earnings, increased M&A activity, higher dividends and additional buybacks. The Fund experienced losses in commodities, primarily from short positions in crude oil and long positions in precious metals. The correlation between equities and energies remained high and the rally in global equities sparked profit taking, reducing investor demand for gold as a safe haven. The Fund had additional losses in foreign exchange from short positions in the Euro/Yen cross, as the Euro showed renewed signs of life, appreciating more than 4% against the Yen. Losses were offset by gains in equities trading and in short-term fixed income markets from long positions in Eurodollar interest rate futures. Weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data led the market to believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve will need to keep interest rates low for an extended period.
 
The release of the August U.S. Federal Reserve meeting minutes resulted in yet another sell-off of “risk assets,” which helped contribute to the rise in fixed income prices. Yields reached multi-year lows in the U.S., Europe and U.K., resulting in gains from the Fund’s long fixed income positions, especially on the long end of the curve. Smaller gains were realized in the commodity markets, primarily in precious metals. Gold fully retraced July’s corrective sell-off, with its August month-end market value closing several ticks higher than the June close. The Fund’s long gold position benefitted from gold’s safe-haven status, as well as from news out of China, the world’s largest consumer and producer of gold, that they will allow greater access to trading of the metal. The Fund’s long silver position also produced favorable results due to its lock-step trading with gold. Long global equity indices holdings resulted in losses for the month. Weak labor and housing data releases, coupled with the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s downgrade of its assessment of the U.S. economic outlook, contributed to the poor performance of U.S. market indices. Japanese equities fared worse, as the stubbornly strong Japanese Yen weighs on Japanese exporters. By month-end, the Euro Stoxx 50 lost nearly 4.5%, the S&P 500 fell about 4.75%, and the Japanese Nikkei lost almost 7.5%. Additional losses were recorded in the foreign exchange markets from short positions in the Euro/Yen cross as the Euro appreciated more than 4% against the Japanese Yen. The Euro moved higher against most currencies as investors covered short positions as the Euro showed renewed signs of life.
 
Asset prices during the month of September were driven by FOMC hinting that the Federal Reserve is ready and willing to undergo a second round of quantitative easing. While the U.S. Dollar and interest rates fell, equities and commodities rose significantly. Commodity trading was the dominant contributor to positive performance for the month, particularly in precious and base metals, grains and soft commodities. Gold prices reached all-time highs, while silver rallied 12% to levels not seen since the early 1980s. Aluminum and nickel prices also posted double-digit increases during the month. Elevated demand and weather-related supply concerns pushed sugar, cotton and corn prices up over 22%, 17% and 10%, respectively. While commodity trading was a strong driver, foreign exchange was also a material contributor to performance, particularly from commodity-linked currencies. The month brought U.S. dollar weakness against all major currencies as investors bet the Federal Reserve would implement a fresh round of asset purchases to jump-start the slowing U.S. economy. Smaller gains were recorded in the equity markets as prices surged higher on fewer concerns of a “double-dip” U.S. recession and a continued increase in M&A activity. Stocks in Asia took the lead, followed by the U.S. and Europe, which lagged due to ongoing sovereign debt level concerns. A portion of the Fund’s gains were offset by losses in fixed income markets as bond prices were extremely volatile during September.

Financial markets in October were fixated on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s intentions to engage in a second round of Quantitative Easing (“QE2”). In September, markets began pricing in the anticipated QE2 stimulus, which clearly continued into October. Over the course of the month the U.S. Treasury markets shifted from speculating on a future deflationary environment to pricing in future inflation in the TIPS market. Perhaps the markets were reacting to Chairman Bernanke’s comments that inflation is too low and unemployment is too high. Commodity trading was a primary driver of gains for the Fund as silver and gold reached new highs mid-month, and zinc and copper surged higher in the base metal category. Sugar and cotton both rose over 22% on supply/demand imbalances, while grains continued their upward trend with corn leading the way in performance for the sector. The growing expectations of QE2 in the U.S., third quarter earnings that largely beat analyst estimates and market expectations for a congressional change of power at the mid-term elections, propelled the global equity markets higher. The Fund recorded strong gains in stock index trading, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. QE2 also took center stage in currency trading, allowing the Fund to benefit from a weaker U.S. Dollar against most major currencies. Asian-based currencies and commodity-linked currencies were, in particular, profitable. Minimal losses were recorded in the fixed income markets as positive intra-month economic data caused market participants to question if additional QE on a global level was warranted on such a massive scale.
 
After much anticipation and debate, the second effort by the U.S. Federal Reserve to stimulate the U.S. economy through government bond purchases. Perhaps a case of “buy the rumor, sell the fact,” bond prices fell following the announcement and continued to fall for the remainder of the month generating losses for the Fund in fixed income trading. In currency trading, once QE2 was announced, the U.S. Dollar never looked back. The Fund’s short U.S. Dollar position was significantly reduced during the month; however, small losses in currency trading were incurred. In Europe, the Euro dropped below 1.30 for the first time in more than 10 weeks as speculation leaned toward a worsening debt crisis, and unemployment in the region rose to the highest level in more than 12 years. Commodities were volatile and mixed, generating small gains in the sector for Campbell on the month. Gains in energy trading and metals were dampened by losses in grains and soft commodities. While the energy complex made new highs for the year, primarily on the Chinese inflation story, cotton prices fell 26% from the mid-November high. It seems to be all about China these days as they attempt to dampen growth for fear of inflation. Equity trading was marginally positive despite mixed performance around the globe. While major U.S. indices finished slightly lower on the month, Japan’s Nikkei was up 8%, primarily driven by the weakening yen. Global Central Bank intervention has made trading based solely on macroeconomic measures difficult. The Fund’s models have naturally tilted to technical indicators until the value of fundamental information is once again relevant to asset prices. We find it quite advantageous to be a systematic investment manager as we navigate through this market volatility in search of opportunity.
 
The appetite for risk based assets was clearly back in vogue during the month of December. Commodities were the strongest performing sector during the month for the Fund as the rally in energies, metals, soft commodities and grain markets continued. The petroleum and industrial metal complexes closed December near the year’s highs on steady demand and a healthy global economic picture. Cotton rallied over 25% during the month to finish up over 90% on the year. Additional gains were recorded in stock index trading as global equity markets staged a strong rally during the month on better than expected economic data, including strong consumer spending during the 2010 holiday season, and increased M&A activity. Despite signs of a stronger economy and higher interest rates, the U.S. Dollar weakened against all major currencies in December, fueling gains for the Fund in the currency sector. Commodity-linked currencies, in particular, enjoyed a strong rally with the Australian Dollar reaching its strongest level since 1982. Despite its strong year-to-date performance, Fixed Income was the only losing sector for the Fund in December, as economic conditions improved and Central Bank policies across the globe remained unchanged.

2009 (For the Year ended December 31)
 
Of the (8.96)% return for the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately (1.66)% was due to trading losses (before commissions) and approximately (7.44)% was due to brokerage fees, operating costs and offering costs borne by the Fund, offset by approximately 0.14% due to interest income.

President Obama’s stimulus plan took center stage in January; however, weak economic data continued to negatively impact global stock markets into the start of the New Year. An early month rally fizzled quickly, causing notable declines in major global indices. The Fund gained in equity indices trading on net short positions across each region. Gains were recorded in fixed income trading as the world’s central banks continued to lower interest rates. Mounting fiscal deficits and huge issuance needs begin to weigh heavy on the long-end; however, credit markets generally improved in January with yield spreads continuing to contract. Foreign exchange trading finished slightly negative on the month. Risk aversion and capital preservation benefited the Fund’s net long U.S. Dollar position; however, the U.K. government’s unprecedented move to give the Bank of England power to increase their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland to 70% helped fuel a late month rally in the British Pound, eliminating gains from a previous decline. Commodity trading was generally flat on volatility across precious and base metals and a slowing of the negative energy trend.
 
In February, the U.S. government’s ability to address the economic crisis was met with skepticism by Wall Street. Economic data remained persistently weak, especially on the employment and housing fronts. The U.S. was not alone in reporting negative news, as European and Asian economies also continued with the release of dismal economic data such as declining exports and falling dividends. The majority of February gains in the Fund resulted from equity indices trading, particularly from short positions in the U.S. and Asia. Additional gains were recorded in foreign exchange trading as investors continued to feed U.S. Dollar strength, particularly relative to the Japanese Yen. The U.S. Dollar continues to be the safe haven pick as the risk aversion theme continued, as evidenced by the U.S. treasury yields recording all-time lows.
 
Stock markets rallied in March as the 2008 fourth quarter earnings announcements subsided and large U.S. banks announced they would be profitable for the first two months of 2009. The majority of the Fund’s losses in March resulted from equity indices trading, as the equity rally adversely impacted net short positions globally. Commodities recorded losses as energy price swings have become correlated with equities and metals surged on news of China’s economic stimulus plan. Gains from fixed income markets were recorded from the Fund’s long global bond positions as prices moved significantly higher on announcements from the Swiss, British and American Central Banks on their intentions of adding liquidity by purchasing medium to long-term bonds in the market. Foreign exchange trading resulted in gains as investors sought currencies whose home central banks were not keen on engaging in quantitative easing.
 
While equity index trading produced the most profitable sector results for the Fund for 2008, the Fund’s net exposure on the short side of global stock indices through April 2009 has hurt performance as markets continued to stage rallies that began in mid-March. U.S. economic indicators, including housing and manufacturing, showed signs of improvement and stabilization rather than further deterioration. In addition, the G-20 agreed to fund more than $1 trillion in emergency aid to help cushion the economic fallout of the current international financial crisis. While the general tone of the economic outlook was more upbeat, officials have still been cautious in their assessment. April saw a continuation of the March risk-seeking rally leading to several growth currencies registering solid gains against the dollar. Losses were realized in the foreign exchange sector due to the Fund’s general bias to be long the dollar against most major currencies. In fixed income, the equity market rally helped general investor sentiment, driving bond prices lower across the board which produced losses for the Fund in this sector. Commodity trading finished relatively flat with gains from the energy sector offsetting small losses in base and precious metals.

In May, conflicting signals on global recovery weighed on the direction of the markets as increased risk appetite and signs of stabilization in the global economy emerged. Equity markets continued their rally, particularly in Asia, generating small gains in the stock index sector. Fixed income trading generated a marginal positive return as short-term rates in Europe climbed higher following the European Central Bank rate cut of 25 basis points. The gains in the stock index and fixed income sectors were offset by losses in the foreign exchange sector. The U.S. Dollar suffered a broad based decline in May on a combination of stronger risk appetite and growing fears over structural deficiencies in the U.S. Investors moved dormant dollar denominated assets overseas to capture growth and risk in commodity block currencies. Smaller losses were also recorded in the commodities sector as natural gas finished a volatile month higher.
 
During June, a surprise payroll number to the upside for May prompted an aggressive sell-off in short-term U.S. rates and raised market expectations of a rate hike in 2009. The price reaction was swift and caused particular difficulty for systematic trading. Losses for the Fund in the fixed income sector were offset by marginal gains in the foreign exchange sector. The Fund’s currency positions were generally mixed, thus hedging some U.S. Dollar risk, as investors crowded the Dollar as a safe-haven trade, pushing it higher on the month. Marginal gains were also recorded in the commodities sector, primarily from long positions in the energy complex. As geo-political headlines were plentiful, energies traded in a highly correlated fashion to global equity markets. The stock index sector finished basically flat for the month as global equity markets reflected mixed results congruent with both positive and negative economic data relating to global recovery.
 
Contrary to investor fears, global stock market returns in 2009 have fueled improved risk appetite as economic data and corporate earnings support the rally for yet another month in July. The Fund’s trading performance was relatively flat, with positive results from long stock and short U.S. Dollar positions being offset by losses incurred from short interest rate positions. For the first half of 2009, many “trend-following” strategies struggled to curb losses and eked out small gains in a market environment that is in a classic “consolidation” (trendless and choppy) period.
 
While risk appetite was generally strong in August, investors’ risk behavior was a bit random as fixed income initially sold off on better than expected payrolls data, but spent the rest of the month rallying. Bernanke’s nomination for a second term and continued “lower rates for longer” comments from Fed officials helped support treasury prices against the Fund’s general positioning across the curve. Smaller losses were recorded in currency trading as investors appeared unwilling to chase growth currencies higher, at the expense of the dollar, from already stretched levels. Gains were recorded in commodity markets as the Fund increased its exposure to this sector with the launch of more agile models providing more efficient holding period diversification. Trading in base and precious metals was a primary driver as the “risk on” trade prevailed on improving economic data. Equity indices trading yielded a marginal gain as positioning geographically and across model groups remains mixed.
During the month of September, the Fund’s technical and fundamental strategies both recorded healthy gains in the foreign exchange sector from short positions in the U.S. Dollar vs. most major currencies. Commodity-linked currencies were particularly profitable for the Fund, as both the Australian and New Zealand Dollars rose in value close to 5%. Technical and fundamental signals were also effective in the equity index sector, where the Fund benefited from primarily long positions across global stock indices. With the exception of Japan, global equities moved higher by 2 — 3% during the month on healthy M&A activity, as well as favorable signs of a manufacturing rebound and consumer spending renewal. Results were mixed in fixed income trading as gains earned from short-term rates were largely offset by losses on the long end of the curve. Commodities trading resulted in marginal losses overall, primarily due to short positions in natural gas. The price of natural gas rallied over 20% during the month as a result of significant short covering in the market despite record storage levels.
 
The risk pendulum continued to swing between “risk on” and “risk off” during the month of October, culminating in “risk off” at month-end and impacting all sectors of the portfolio. As global equity markets fell, commodities fell in tandem and the U.S. Dollar rallied along with fixed income in a thematic trade tied to central bank activity. While the Fund’s risk exposure to equity indices was relatively low, our net long position yielded the largest sector loss during the month. The perseverance of the “risk off” trade at month-end resulted in modest losses in foreign exchange, modest gains in commodities.
 
  
27
  
November saw strong trends generate a return of 3.03%, with solid gains in interest rates, foreign exchange, and commodities. Weaker than expected new home sales to start the month, the Federal Open Market Committee’s retention of “extended period” language at mid-month, and a flight to quality at month-end fueled by fears over Dubai debt pushed bond prices higher throughout the month. Thus, trading in fixed income contributed to strong gains from both the short and long end of the curve; foreign exchange trading profited from a continued downward trend of the U.S. Dollar; and commodity trading benefitted from gains in precious metals.
 
In December, the markets saw a rapid reversal in fixed income and the U.S. Dollar. Inflationary fears subsided as better than expected U.S. economic data fueled equity prices higher and bond prices lower. While market participants seemed to be trading at reduced risk levels, price trends were inconsistent leading into the holiday break, causing losses for many systematic managers, including Campbell. Sharp losses in fixed income trading and modest losses in foreign exchange outweighed solid gains in cash equities and equity indices trading, resulting in a net loss for the month.
 
Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
 
Introduction
 
Past Results Not Necessarily Indicative of Future Performance
 
The Fund is a speculative commodity pool. The market sensitive instruments held by it are acquired for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Fund’s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Fund’s main line of business.
 
Market movements result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Fund’s open positions and, consequently, in its earnings and cash flow. The Fund’s market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the Fund’s open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which it trades.
 
The Fund rapidly acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the Fund’s past performance is not necessarily indicative of its future results.
 
Standard of Materiality
 
Materiality as used in this section, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and the potential losses caused by such movements, taking into account the leverage and multiplier features of the Fund’s market sensitive instruments.
 
Quantifying the Fund’s Trading Value at Risk
 
Quantitative Forward-Looking Statements
 
The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Fund’s market risk exposures contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact (such as the dollar amount of maintenance margin required for market risk sensitive instruments held at the end of the reporting period).
 
  
28
  
The Fund’s risk exposure in the various market sectors traded is estimated in terms of Value at Risk (VaR). The Fund estimates VaR using a model based upon historical simulation (with a confidence level of 97.5%) which involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading portfolio. The VaR model takes into account linear exposures to risks, including equity and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and correlation among these variables. The hypothetical changes in portfolio value are based on daily percentage changes observed in key market indices or other market factors to which the portfolio is sensitive. The Fund’s VaR at a one day 97.5% confidence level of the Fund’s VaR corresponds to the negative change in portfolio value that, based on observed market risk factors, would have been exceeded once in 40 trading days or one day in 40. VaR typically does not represent the worst case outcome.
 
The Fund uses approximately one quarter of daily market data and revalues its portfolio for each of the historical market moves that occurred over this time period. This generates a probability distribution of daily “simulated profit and loss” outcomes. The VaR is the 2.5 percentile of this distribution.
 
The VaR for a sector represents the one day downside risk for the aggregate exposures associated with this sector. The current methodology used to calculate the aggregate VaR represents the VaR of the Fund’s open positions across all market sectors, and is less than the sum of the VaRs for all such market sectors due to the diversification benefit across asset classes.
 
The Fund’s VaR computations are based on the risk representation of the underlying benchmark for each instrument or contract and does not distinguish between exchange and non-exchange dealer-based instruments. It is also not based on exchange and/or dealer-based maintenance margin requirements.
 
VaR models, including the Fund’s, are continually evolving as trading portfolios become more diverse and modeling techniques and systems capabilities improve. Please note that the VaR model is used to numerically quantify market risk for historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by the Fund in its daily risk management activities. Please further note that VaR as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.
 
Because the business of the Fund is the speculative trading of futures and forwards, the composition of the Fund’s trading portfolio can change significantly over any given time period, or even within a single trading day, which could positively or negatively materially impact market risk as measured by VaR.

Material Limitations of Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk
 
The following limitations of VaR as an assessment of market risk should be noted:
 
1)
  
Past changes in market risk factors will not always result in accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements;
 
2)
  
Changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those of the VaR model;
 
3)
  
VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions;
 
4)
  
VaR using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; and
 
5)
  
The historical market risk factor data for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under certain unusual market movements.
 
VaR is not necessarily representative of historic risk nor should it be used to predict the Fund’s future financial performance or its ability to manage and monitor risk. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated or that such losses will not occur more than once in 40 trading days.

Non-Trading Risk
 
The Fund has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances (as well as the market risk they represent) are immaterial. The Fund also has non-trading market risk as a result of investing a substantial portion of its available assets in U.S. Treasury Bills held at the broker and over-the-counter counterparty. The market risk represented by these investments is minimal. Finally, the Fund has non-trading market risk on fixed income securities held as part of its cash management program. The cash manager will use its best endeavors in the management of the assets of the Fund but provide no guarantee that any profit or interest will accrue to the Fund as a result of such management.
 
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures
 
The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Fund’s market risk exposures — except for (i) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (ii) the descriptions of how the Fund manages its primary market risk exposures — constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act. The Fund’s primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by Campbell & Company for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results of the Fund’s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s current market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in the Fund.
 
The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the Fund as of December 31, 2011, by market sector.
 
Currencies
 
The Fund’s currency exposure is to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions. The Fund trades in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates — i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Campbell & Company does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Fund’s currency sector will change significantly in the future.
 
Interest Rates
 
Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond positions held by the Fund and indirectly the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest rate movements between countries materially impact the Fund’s profitability. The Fund’s primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the United States and the other G-7 countries. Campbell & Company anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary rate exposure of the Fund for the foreseeable future. Changes in the interest rate environment will have the most impact on longer dated fixed income positions, at points of time throughout the year the majority of the speculative positions held by the Fund may be held in medium to long-term fixed income positions.
 
Stock Indices
 
The Fund’s primary equity exposure is to equity price risk in the G-7 countries and several other countries (Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan and Netherlands). The stock index futures traded by the Fund are by law limited to futures on broadly based indices. The Fund is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and Japanese indices. Markets that trade in a narrow range could result in the Fund’s positions being “whipsawed” into numerous small losses.
 
  
31
  
Energy
 
The Fund’s primary energy market exposure is to natural gas, crude oil and derivative product price movements, often resulting from international political developments and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the perceived outcome. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in this market.
 
Metals
 
The Fund’s metals market exposure is to fluctuations in the price of aluminum, copper, gold, nickel, silver and zinc.
 
Agricultural
 
The Fund’s agricultural exposure is to the fluctuations of the price of cattle, coffee, corn, cotton, hogs, soy, sugar, and wheat.
 
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure
 
The following were the non-trading risk exposures of the Fund as of December 31, 2011.
 
Foreign Currency Balances
 
The Fund’s primary foreign currency balances are in Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen, British Pounds and Euros. The Fund controls the non-trading risk of these balances by regularly converting these balances back into dollars (no less frequently than twice a month, and more frequently if a particular foreign currency balance becomes unusually large).
 
Fixed Income Securities
 
The Fund’s primary market exposure in instruments (other than treasury positions described in the subsequent section) held other than for trading is in its fixed income portfolio. The cash manager, Horizon, has authority to make certain investments on behalf of the Fund. All securities purchased by the cash manager on behalf of the Fund will be held in the Fund’s custody account at the custodian. The cash manager will use its best endeavors in the management of the assets of the Fund but provide no guarantee that any profit or interest will accrue to the Fund as a result of such management.
 
Treasury Bill Positions for Margin Purposes
 
The Fund also has market exposure in its Treasury Bill portfolio. The Fund holds Treasury Bills (interest bearing and credit risk-free) with maturities no longer than six months. Violent fluctuations in prevailing interest rates could cause minimal mark-to-market losses on the Fund’s Treasury Bills, although substantially all of these short-term investments are held to maturity.
 
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure
 
The means by which the Fund and Campbell & Company, severally, attempt to manage the risk of the Fund’s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. Campbell & Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per “risk unit” of assets under management. In addition, Campbell & Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as reducing position sizes dynamically in response to trading losses.
 
Campbell & Company manages the risk of the Fund’s non-trading instruments of Treasury Bills held for margin purposes by limiting the duration of such instruments to no more than six months. Campbell & Company manages the risk of the Fund’s fixed income securities held for cash management purposes by restricting the cash managers to investing in securities that are modeled after those investments allowed by the futures broker as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act, Title 17, Part 1, § 1.25 Investment of customer funds. Investments can include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. Government Securities, Government Agency Securities, Municipal Securities, banker acceptances and certificates of deposits; (ii) commercial paper; and (iii) short-term investment grade corporate debt.
 
  
32
  
General
 
The Fund is unaware of any (i) anticipated known demands, commitments or capital expenditures; (ii) material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in its capital resources; or (iii) trends or uncertainties that will have a material effect on operations. From time to time, certain regulatory agencies have proposed increased margin requirements on futures contracts. Because the Fund generally will use a small percentage of assets as margin, the Fund does not believe that any increase in margin requirements, as proposed, will have a material effect on the Fund’s operations.
 
Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 
Financial statements meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X appear beginning on Page 43 of this report. The supplementary financial information specified by Item 302 of Regulation S-K is included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.

Item 9A.   Controls and Procedures.
 
Campbell & Company, Inc., the general partner of the Fund, with the participation of the general partner’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) with respect to the Fund as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on their evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in the general partner’s internal control over financial reporting applicable to the Fund identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting applicable to the Fund.
 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Campbell & Company, Inc. (“CCI”), the general partner of the Fund is responsible for the management of the partnership. Management of CCI (“Management”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
 
The Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
 
  
•
  
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Partnership;
  
  
  
  
  
•
  
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the partnership’s transactions are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Management and;
  
  
  
  
  
•
  
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Partnership’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
 
  
33
  
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, Management used the framework established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). As a result of this assessment and based on the criteria in the COSO framework, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
To the Partners of
Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P.
 
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P. (the “Partnership”), including the condensed schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, cash flows, changes in partners’ capital (net asset value) and financial highlights for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the results of its operations, its cash flows, changes in its partners’ capital (net asset value) and the financial highlights for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Note 1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
A.  General Description of the Fund
 
Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a Delaware limited partnership which operates as a commodity investment pool. The Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts and forward currency contracts. Prior to September 2011, the Fund also traded options on forward currency contracts. 
B.  Regulation
 
As a registrant with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Fund is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a commodity investment pool, the Fund is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the United States government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various commodity exchanges where the Fund executes transactions. Additionally, the Fund is subject to the requirements of futures commission merchants (the "brokers') and interbank market makers through which the Fund trades. 
C.  Method of Reporting
 
The Fund's financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which may require the use of certain estimates made by the Fund's management. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains and losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) are reported in the Statements of Financial Condition as a net gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 210-20, "Offsetting - Balance Sheet." The fair value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward currency (non-exchange traded) contracts was extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period.
The fair value of option (non-exchange traded) contracts is calculated by applying an industry-standard adaptation of the Black-Scholes options valuation model to foreign currency options, using as inputs the spot prices, interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Operations.
When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current fair value of option written. Brokerage commissions include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened.
The fixed income investments, other than U.S. Treasury bills, are held at the custodian and marked to market on the last business day of the reporting period by the custodian who utilizes a third party vendor hierarchy of pricing providers who specialize in such markets. The prices furnished by the providers consider the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type, as well as prices quoted by dealers who make markets in such securities. U.S. Treasury bills are held at the brokers or interbank market makers and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Premiums and discounts on fixed income securities are amortized and accreted for financial reporting purposes.
For purposes of both financial reporting and calculation of redemption value, Net Asset Value per unit is calculated by dividing Net Asset Value by the number of outstanding units.
The Fund follows the provisions of ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures." ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The value of the Fund's exchange-traded futures contracts fall into this category.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This category includes forward currency contracts and options on forward currency contracts that the Fund values using models or other valuation methodologies derived from observable market data. This category also includes fixed income investments.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability (including the Fund's own assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments). Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Fund did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities.
In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 ("ASU 2010-06") for improving disclosure about fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 adds new disclosure requirements about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). It also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to the levels of disaggregation for fair value measurement and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As of January 1, 2010, the Fund adopted the provisions of ASC 2010-06 except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which were adopted as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of the remaining provisions have not had a material impact on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.
The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Fund's investments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

D.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and overnight money market investments at financial institutions.
E.  Income Taxes
 
The Fund prepares calendar year U.S. federal and applicable state information tax returns and reports to the partners their allocable shares of the Fund's income, expenses and trading gains or losses. No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as each partner is individually responsible for reporting income or loss based on such partner's respective share of the Fund's income and expenses as reported for income tax purposes.
Management has continued to evaluate the application of ASC 740, "Income Taxes," to the Fund, and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions were required. There are no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. The Fund files federal and state tax returns. The 2008 through 2011 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.
F.  Offering Costs
 
Campbell & Company, Inc. ("Campbell & Company") has incurred all costs in connection with the initial and continuous offering of units of the Fund ("offering costs"). In addition, Campbell & Company continues to compensate wholesalers for services rendered to Limited Partners. The Fund's liability for offering costs is limited to the maximum of total offering costs incurred by Campbell & Company or 2.5% of the aggregate subscriptions accepted during the initial and continuous offerings. The Fund is only liable for payment of offering costs on a monthly basis as calculated based on the limitations stated above. At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Fund reflects a liability in the Statements of Financial Condition for offering costs payable to Campbell & Company of $244,794 and $407,181, respectively. The amount of monthly reimbursement due to Campbell & Company is charged directly to partners' capital.
If the Fund terminates prior to completion of payment of the calculated amounts to Campbell & Company, Campbell & Company will not be entitled to any additional payments, and the Fund will have no further obligation to Campbell & Company. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the amount of unreimbursed offering costs incurred by Campbell & Company is $424,681 and $414,245, respectively.
G.  Foreign Currency Transactions
 
The Fund's functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the Statements of Financial Condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income.
H.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04 ("ASU 2011-04") to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  ASU 2011-04 explains how to measure fair value.  It does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The impact of this guidance on the Fund's financial statements and disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

Note 2.  GENERAL PARTNER AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR
 
The general partner of the Fund is Campbell & Company, which conducts and manages the business of the Fund. Campbell & Company is also the commodity trading advisor of the Fund. The Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that Campbell & Company may make withdrawals of its units, provided that such withdrawals do not reduce Campbell & Company's aggregate percentage interest in the Fund to less than 1% of the net aggregate contributions.
Campbell & Company is required by the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership to maintain a net worth equal to at least 5% of the capital contributed by all the limited partnerships for which it acts as general partner, including the Fund. The minimum net worth shall in no case be less than $50,000 nor shall net worth in excess of $1,000,000 be required.
The Fund pays a monthly brokerage fee equal to 1/12 of 7% (7% annualized) of month-end net assets to Campbell & Company and approximately $4 per round turn to the broker for execution and clearing costs. From the 7% fee, a portion (4%) is used to compensate selling agents for ongoing services rendered and a portion (3%) is retained by Campbell & Company for trading and management services rendered. The amount paid to the broker and interbank market makers for execution and clearing costs is limited to 1/12 of 1% (1% annualized) of month-end net assets.
Campbell & Company is also paid a quarterly performance fee of 20% of the Fund's aggregate cumulative appreciation in the Net Asset Value per unit, exclusive of appreciation attributable to interest income. More specifically, the performance fee is paid on the cumulative increase, if any, in the Net Asset Value per Unit over the highest previous cumulative Net Asset Value per Unit (commonly referred to as a High Water Mark) adjusting for investment income. In determining the brokerage and performance fees (the "fees"), adjustments shall be made for capital additions and withdrawals and Net Assets shall not be reduced by the fees being calculated for such current period. The performance fee is not subject to any clawback provisions. The fees are typically paid in the month following the month in which they are earned. The fees are paid from the available cash at the Fund's bank, broker or cash management accounts.
Note 3.  CASH MANAGER AND CUSTODIAN
 
In July 2009, the Fund appointed Wilmington Trust Investment Management LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilmington Trust Corporation, and Horizon Cash Management LLC as cash managers under the Non-Custody Investment Advisory Agreements to manage and control the liquid assets of the Fund. Each cash manager is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC of the United States under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
The Fund opened custodial accounts at The Northern Trust Company (the "custodian") and has granted the cash managers authority to make certain investments on behalf of the Fund provided such investments are consistent with the investment guidelines created by the general partner. All securities purchased by the cash managers on behalf of the Fund will be held in the Fund's custody accounts at the custodian. The cash managers will have no beneficial or other interest in the securities and cash in such custody accounts.
 
In December 2010, the Fund terminated the Non-Custody Investment Advisory Agreement with Wilmington Trust Invesment Management LLC as cash manager.
Note 4.  DEPOSITS WITH FUTURES BROKERS
 
The Fund deposits assets with UBS Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (the "brokers") subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations and various exchange and broker requirements. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills and cash with such brokers. The Fund typically earns interest income on its assets deposited with the brokers.
Note 5.  DEPOSITS WITH INTERBANK MARKET MAKER
 
The Fund’s counterparties with regard to its forward currency transactions are The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC ("RBS") and UBS AG ("UBS"). The Fund has entered into an International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. agreement with RBS and UBS which governs these transactions. The credit ratings reported by the three major rating agencies for RBS and UBS were considered investment grade as of December 31, 2011. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills and cash with RBS and UBS. The Fund typically earns interest income on its assets deposited with the RBS and UBS.

Note 6.  OPERATING EXPENSES
 
Operating expenses of the Fund are limited by the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership to 0.5% per year of the average month end Net Asset Value of the Fund. Actual operating expenses were less than 0.5% (annualized) of average month-end Net Asset Value for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Note 7.  SUBSCRIPTIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS
 
Investments in the Fund were made by subscription agreement, subject to acceptance by Campbell & Company. The Fund is open only to existing investors.
The Fund is not required to make distributions, but may do so at the sole discretion of Campbell & Company. A limited partner may request and receive redemption of units owned, subject to restrictions in the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership. Units are transferable, but no market exists for their sale and none is expected to develop. Monthly redemptions are permitted upon ten (10) business days advance written notice to Campbell & Company. 
Redemption fees, which are paid to Campbell & Company, apply through the first twelve month-ends following purchase as follows: 4% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the third month-end, 3% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the sixth month-end, 2% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the ninth month-end and 1% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the twelfth month end. After the twelfth month-end following purchase of a unit, no redemption fees apply. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Campbell & Company received redemption fees of $0,  $0 and $11,966, respectively.
Note 8.  TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RELATED RISKS
 
The Fund engages in the speculative trading of U.S. and foreign futures contracts, forward currency contracts and options on forward currency contracts (collectively, "derivatives"). Specifically, the Fund trades a portfolio focused on financial futures, which are instruments designed to hedge or speculate on changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, stock index values, as well as metals, energy and agriculture values. The Fund is exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.
Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker's proprietary activities. A customer's cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker's segregation requirements. In the event of a broker's insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited.
The amount of required margin and good faith deposits with the broker and interbank market makers usually range from 10% to 30% of Net Asset Value. The market value of securities held to satisfy such requirements at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $117,099,824 and $179,995,799, respectively, which equals 13% and 13% of Net Asset Value, respectively. The cash deposited with interbank market makers at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $1,166,395 and $83,046,799, respectively, which equals  0% and 6% of Net Asset Value, respectively. Included in cash deposits with the broker and interbank market maker at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was restricted cash for margin requirements of $44,204,325 and $4,324,051 respectively, which equals 5% and 0% of Net Asset Value respectively.
The Fund trades forward currency and options on forward currency contracts in unregulated markets between principals and assumes the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance. Accordingly, the risks associated with forward currency and options on foreign currency contracts are generally greater than those associated with exchange traded contracts because of the greater risk of counterparty default. Additionally, the trading of forward currency and options on forward currency contracts typically involves delayed cash settlement.
The Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with financial institutions. In the event of a financial institution's insolvency, recovery of Fund assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.

For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of futures and forward currency contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both a buyer and seller of options, the Fund pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Fund to potentially unlimited liability, and purchased options expose the Fund to a risk of loss limited to the premiums paid. See Note 1. C. for an explanation of how the Fund determines its valuation for derivatives as well as the netting of derivatives.
The Fund has adopted the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ("ASC 815"). ASC 815 provides enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments are accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
 
The following tables summarize quantitative information required by ASC 815.

** Amount differs from the amount on the Statements of Operations as the amount above does not include gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances at the futures brokers.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the monthly average of futures contracts bought and sold was approximately 85,500, 86,000 and 85,200, respectively, and the monthly average of notional value of forward currency and options on forward currency contracts was $11,755,500,000, $10,238,700,000 and $10,284,500,000, respectively.
Open contracts generally mature within three months; as of December 31, 2011, the latest maturity date for open futures contracts is September 2013 and the latest maturity date for open forward currency contracts is March 2012. However, the Fund intends to close all futures and foreign currency contracts prior to maturity.

CAMPBELL S TRATEGIC A LLOCATION F UND, L.P. 
N OTES TO F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS 
D ECEMBER 31, 2011
 
 
Campbell & Company has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. Campbell & Company's basic market risk control procedures consist of continuously monitoring open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30%. Campbell & Company's attempt to manage the risk of the Fund's open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. Campbell & Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per 'risk unit' of assets under management. In addition, Campbell & Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as precalculating 'stop-loss' points at which systems will signal to close open positions. Campbell & Company controls the risk of the Fund's non-trading fixed income instruments by limiting the duration of such instruments and requiring a minimum credit quality of the issuers of those instruments.
Campbell & Company seeks to minimize credit risk primarily by depositing and maintaining the Fund's assets at financial institutions and brokers which Campbell & Company believes to be credit worthy. The limited partners bears the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.
Note 9.  INDEMNIFICATIONS
 
In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred. The Fund expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.
Note 10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
Management of the Fund has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were filed. Other than the following, there are no subsequent events to disclose or record. Effective January 6, 2012, Units in the Fund were no longer offered for sale. For existing investors in the Fund, business has been and will be conducted as usual. There was no change in trading, operations, or monthly statements, etc., and redemptions will continue to be offered on a monthly basis.

ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

ASU 2010-06 adds new disclosure requirements about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). It also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to the levels of disaggregation for fair value measurement and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As of January 1, 2010, the Fund adopted the provisions of ASC 2010-06 except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which were adopted as of January 1, 2011.

Specifically, the Fund trades a portfolio&#160;focused on financial futures, which are instruments designed to hedge or speculate on changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, stock index values,&#160;as well as metals, energy and agriculture values. The Fund is exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker's proprietary activities. A customer's cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker's segregation requirements. In the event of a broker's insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The amount of required margin and good faith deposits with the broker and interbank market makers usually range from 10% to 30% of Net Asset Value. The market value of securities held to satisfy such requirements at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $117,099,824 and $179,995,799, respectively, which equals 13% and 13% of Net Asset Value, respectively. The cash deposited with interbank market makers at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $1,166,395 and $83,046,799, respectively, which equals&#160; 0% and 6% of Net Asset Value, respectively. Included in cash deposits with the broker and interbank market maker at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was restricted cash for margin requirements of $44,204,325 and $4,324,051 respectively, which equals 5% and 0% of Net Asset Value respectively.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Fund trades forward currency and options on forward currency contracts in unregulated markets between principals and assumes the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance. Accordingly, the risks associated with forward currency and options on foreign currency contracts are generally greater than those associated with exchange traded contracts because of the greater risk of counterparty default. Additionally, the trading of forward currency and options on forward currency contracts typically involves delayed cash settlement.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with financial institutions. In the event of a financial institution's insolvency, recovery of Fund assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"></font>&#160;</div><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of futures and forward currency contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both a buyer and seller of options, the Fund pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Fund to potentially unlimited liability, and purchased options expose the Fund to a risk of loss limited to the premiums paid. See Note 1. C. for an explanation of how the Fund determines its valuation for derivatives as well as the netting of derivatives.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">The Fund has adopted the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ("ASC 815"). ASC 815 provides enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments are accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt;

Campbell &amp; Company's basic market risk control procedures consist of continuously monitoring open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30%. Campbell &amp; Company's attempt to manage the risk of the Fund's open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. Campbell &amp; Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per 'risk unit' of assets under management. In addition, Campbell &amp; Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as precalculating 'stop-loss' points at which systems will signal to close open positions. Campbell &amp; Company controls the risk of the Fund's non-trading fixed income instruments by limiting the duration of such instruments and requiring a minimum credit quality of the issuers of those instruments.</font></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block"><br /></div><div style="LINE-HEIGHT: 11.4pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0pt; DISPLAY: block; MARGIN-LEFT: 0pt; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0pt" align="left"><font style="DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: Times New Roman; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Campbell &amp; Company seeks to minimize credit risk primarily by depositing and maintaining the Fund's assets at financial institutions and brokers which Campbell &amp; Company believes to be credit worthy.

            - Definition
                Includes currency on hand as well as demand deposits with banks or financial institutions. It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty. Cash equivalents, excluding items classified as marketable securities, include short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months. Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents, while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents. Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity's continuing operations. Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group (and discontinued operation).

            - Definition
                The net cash from (used in) all of the entity's operating activities, including those of discontinued operations, of the reporting entity. Operating activities generally involve producing and delivering goods and providing services. Operating activity cash flows include transactions, adjustments, and changes in value that are not defined as investing or financing activities. While for technical reasons this element has no balance attribute, the default assumption is a debit balance consistent with its label.

        SUBSCRIPTIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS
        Note 7.  SUBSCRIPTIONS, DISTRIBUTIONS AND REDEMPTIONS   Investments in the Fund were made by subscription agreement, subject to acceptance by Campbell & Company. The Fund is open only to existing investors. The Fund is not required to make distributions, but may do so at the sole discretion of Campbell & Company. A limited partner may request and receive redemption of units owned, subject to restrictions in the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership. Units are transferable, but no market exists for their sale and none is expected to develop. Monthly redemptions are permitted upon ten (10) business days advance written notice to Campbell & Company.  Redemption fees, which are paid to Campbell & Company, apply through the first twelve month-ends following purchase as follows: 4% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the third month-end, 3% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the sixth month-end, 2% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the ninth month-end and 1% of Net Asset Value per unit redeemed through the twelfth month end. After the twelfth month-end following purchase of a unit, no redemption fees apply. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Campbell & Company received redemption fees of $0,  $0 and $11,966, respectively.

        TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RELATED RISKS
        Note 8.  TRADING ACTIVITIES AND RELATED RISKS   The Fund engages in the speculative trading of U.S. and foreign futures contracts, forward currency contracts and options on forward currency contracts (collectively, "derivatives"). Specifically, the Fund trades a portfolio focused on financial futures, which are instruments designed to hedge or speculate on changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, stock index values, as well as metals, energy and agriculture values. The Fund is exposed to both market risk, the risk arising from changes in the market value of the contracts, and credit risk, the risk of failure by another party to perform according to the terms of a contract. Purchase and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with the broker. Additional deposits may be necessary for any loss on contract value. The Commodity Exchange Act requires a broker to segregate all customer transactions and assets from such broker's proprietary activities. A customer's cash and other property (for example, U.S. Treasury bills) deposited with a broker are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the broker's segregation requirements. In the event of a broker's insolvency, recovery may be limited to a pro rata share of segregated funds available. It is possible that the recovered amount could be less than total cash and other property deposited. The amount of required margin and good faith deposits with the broker and interbank market makers usually range from 10% to 30% of Net Asset Value. The market value of securities held to satisfy such requirements at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $117,099,824 and $179,995,799, respectively, which equals 13% and 13% of Net Asset Value, respectively. The cash deposited with interbank market makers at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $1,166,395 and $83,046,799, respectively, which equals  0% and 6% of Net Asset Value, respectively. Included in cash deposits with the broker and interbank market maker at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was restricted cash for margin requirements of $44,204,325 and $4,324,051 respectively, which equals 5% and 0% of Net Asset Value respectively. The Fund trades forward currency and options on forward currency contracts in unregulated markets between principals and assumes the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance. Accordingly, the risks associated with forward currency and options on foreign currency contracts are generally greater than those associated with exchange traded contracts because of the greater risk of counterparty default. Additionally, the trading of forward currency and options on forward currency contracts typically involves delayed cash settlement. The Fund has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with financial institutions. In the event of a financial institution's insolvency, recovery of Fund assets on deposit may be limited to account insurance or other protection afforded such deposits.   For derivatives, risks arise from changes in the market value of the contracts. Theoretically, the Fund is exposed to a market risk equal to the notional contract value of futures and forward currency contracts purchased and unlimited liability on such contracts sold short. As both a buyer and seller of options, the Fund pays or receives a premium at the outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the contract underlying the option. Written options expose the Fund to potentially unlimited liability, and purchased options expose the Fund to a risk of loss limited to the premiums paid. See Note 1. C. for an explanation of how the Fund determines its valuation for derivatives as well as the netting of derivatives. The Fund has adopted the provisions of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, ("ASC 815"). ASC 815 provides enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments are accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows.   The following tables summarize quantitative information required by ASC 815. The fair value of the Fund's derivatives by instrument type, as well as the location of those instruments on the Statements of Financial Condition, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:

gains and losses on foreign currency cash balances at the futures brokers.   For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the monthly average of futures contracts bought and sold was approximately 85,500, 86,000 and 85,200, respectively, and the monthly average of notional value of forward currency and options on forward currency contracts was $11,755,500,000, $10,238,700,000 and $10,284,500,000, respectively. Open contracts generally mature within three months; as of December 31, 2011, the latest maturity date for open futures contracts is September 2013 and the latest maturity date for open forward currency contracts is March 2012. However, the Fund intends to close all futures and foreign currency contracts prior to maturity.   Campbell & Company has established procedures to actively monitor market risk and minimize credit risk, although there can be no assurance that it will, in fact, succeed in doing so. Campbell & Company's basic market risk control procedures consist of continuously monitoring open positions, diversification of the portfolio and maintenance of a margin-to-equity ratio that rarely exceeds 30%. Campbell & Company's attempt to manage the risk of the Fund's open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. Campbell & Company applies risk management policies to its trading which generally limit the total exposure that may be taken per 'risk unit' of assets under management. In addition, Campbell & Company follows diversification guidelines (often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and correlated groups), as well as precalculating 'stop-loss' points at which systems will signal to close open positions. Campbell & Company controls the risk of the Fund's non-trading fixed income instruments by limiting the duration of such instruments and requiring a minimum credit quality of the issuers of those instruments. Campbell & Company seeks to minimize credit risk primarily by depositing and maintaining the Fund's assets at financial institutions and brokers which Campbell & Company believes to be credit worthy. The limited partners bears the risk of loss only to the extent of the market value of their respective investments and, in certain specific circumstances, distributions and redemptions received.

            - Definition
                Debt (bills, notes or bonds) that are issued by the government of the United States which are short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Generally, only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition. Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment. For example, both a three-month US Treasury bill and a three-year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents. However, a Treasury note purchased three-years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months.

        GENERAL PARTNER AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR
        Note 2.  GENERAL PARTNER AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR   The general partner of the Fund is Campbell & Company, which conducts and manages the business of the Fund. Campbell & Company is also the commodity trading advisor of the Fund. The Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that Campbell & Company may make withdrawals of its units, provided that such withdrawals do not reduce Campbell & Company's aggregate percentage interest in the Fund to less than 1% of the net aggregate contributions. Campbell & Company is required by the Amended Agreement of Limited Partnership to maintain a net worth equal to at least 5% of the capital contributed by all the limited partnerships for which it acts as general partner, including the Fund. The minimum net worth shall in no case be less than $50,000 nor shall net worth in excess of $1,000,000 be required. The Fund pays a monthly brokerage fee equal to 1/12 of 7% (7% annualized) of month-end net assets to Campbell & Company and approximately $4 per round turn to the broker for execution and clearing costs. From the 7% fee, a portion (4%) is used to compensate selling agents for ongoing services rendered and a portion (3%) is retained by Campbell & Company for trading and management services rendered. The amount paid to the broker and interbank market makers for execution and clearing costs is limited to 1/12 of 1% (1% annualized) of month-end net assets. Campbell & Company is also paid a quarterly performance fee of 20% of the Fund's aggregate cumulative appreciation in the Net Asset Value per unit, exclusive of appreciation attributable to interest income. More specifically, the performance fee is paid on the cumulative increase, if any, in the Net Asset Value per Unit over the highest previous cumulative Net Asset Value per Unit (commonly referred to as a High Water Mark) adjusting for investment income. In determining the brokerage and performance fees (the "fees"), adjustments shall be made for capital additions and withdrawals and Net Assets shall not be reduced by the fees being calculated for such current period. The performance fee is not subject to any clawback provisions. The fees are typically paid in the month following the month in which they are earned. The fees are paid from the available cash at the Fund's bank, broker or cash management accounts.

        ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
        Note 1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   A.  General Description of the Fund   Campbell Strategic Allocation Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a Delaware limited partnership which operates as a commodity investment pool. The Fund engages in the speculative trading of futures contracts and forward currency contracts. Prior to September 2011, the Fund also traded options on forward currency contracts.  B.  Regulation   As a registrant with the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Fund is subject to the regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a commodity investment pool, the Fund is subject to the regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the United States government which regulates most aspects of the commodity futures industry; rules of the National Futures Association, an industry self-regulatory organization; and the requirements of the various commodity exchanges where the Fund executes transactions. Additionally, the Fund is subject to the requirements of futures commission merchants (the "brokers') and interbank market makers through which the Fund trades.  C.  Method of Reporting   The Fund's financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which may require the use of certain estimates made by the Fund's management. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Gains or losses are realized when contracts are liquidated. Unrealized gains and losses on open contracts (the difference between contract trade price and market price) are reported in the Statements of Financial Condition as a net gain or loss, as there exists a right of offset of unrealized gains or losses in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 210-20, "Offsetting - Balance Sheet." The fair value of futures (exchange-traded) contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of forward currency (non-exchange traded) contracts was extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of option (non-exchange traded) contracts is calculated by applying an industry-standard adaptation of the Black-Scholes options valuation model to foreign currency options, using as inputs the spot prices, interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. Any change in net unrealized gain or loss from the preceding period is reported in the Statements of Operations. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current fair value of option written. Brokerage commissions include other trading fees and are charged to expense when contracts are opened. The fixed income investments, other than U.S. Treasury bills, are held at the custodian and marked to market on the last business day of the reporting period by the custodian who utilizes a third party vendor hierarchy of pricing providers who specialize in such markets. The prices furnished by the providers consider the yield or price of bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity, and type, as well as prices quoted by dealers who make markets in such securities. U.S. Treasury bills are held at the brokers or interbank market makers and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Premiums and discounts on fixed income securities are amortized and accreted for financial reporting purposes. For purposes of both financial reporting and calculation of redemption value, Net Asset Value per unit is calculated by dividing Net Asset Value by the number of outstanding units. The Fund follows the provisions of ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures." ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.   ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The value of the Fund's exchange-traded futures contracts fall into this category. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. This category includes forward currency contracts and options on forward currency contracts that the Fund values using models or other valuation methodologies derived from observable market data. This category also includes fixed income investments. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for an asset or liability (including the Fund's own assumptions used in determining the fair value of investments). Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. As of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Fund did not have any Level 3 assets or liabilities. In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-06 ("ASU 2010-06") for improving disclosure about fair value measurements. ASU 2010-06 adds new disclosure requirements about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). It also clarifies existing disclosure requirements relating to the levels of disaggregation for fair value measurement and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As of January 1, 2010, the Fund adopted the provisions of ASC 2010-06 except for disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the rollforward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which were adopted as of January 1, 2011. The adoption of the remaining provisions have not had a material impact on the Fund's financial statement disclosures. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the Fund's investments accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.       Fair Value at December 31, 2011   Description   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Investments                         Fixed income securities   $ 0     $ 815,730,460     $ 0     $ 815,730,460   Other Financial Instruments                                 Exchange-traded futures contracts     15,706,142       0       0       15,706,142   Forward currency contracts     0       20,810,573       0       20,810,573   Total   $ 15,706,142     $ 836,541,033     $ 0     $ 852,247,175           Fair Value at December 31, 2010   Description   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total   Investments                         Fixed income securities   $ 0     $ 1,024,388,662     $ 0     $ 1,024,388,662   Other Financial Instruments                                 Exchange-traded futures contracts     18,350,278       0       0       18,350,278   Forward currency contracts     0       22,181,636       0       22,181,636   Options purchased     0       6,243,013       0       6,243,013   Options written     0       (2,884,114 )     0       (2,884,114 )   Total   $ 18,350,278     $ 1,049,929,197     $ 0     $ 1,068,279,475   The gross presentation of the fair value of the Fund's derivatives by instrument type is shown in Note 8. See Condensed Schedules of Investments for additional detail categorization.   D.  Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and overnight money market investments at financial institutions. E.  Income Taxes   The Fund prepares calendar year U.S. federal and applicable state information tax returns and reports to the partners their allocable shares of the Fund's income, expenses and trading gains or losses. No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as each partner is individually responsible for reporting income or loss based on such partner's respective share of the Fund's income and expenses as reported for income tax purposes. Management has continued to evaluate the application of ASC 740, "Income Taxes," to the Fund, and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions were required. There are no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months. The Fund files federal and state tax returns. The 2008 through 2011 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. F.  Offering Costs   Campbell & Company, Inc. ("Campbell & Company") has incurred all costs in connection with the initial and continuous offering of units of the Fund ("offering costs"). In addition, Campbell & Company continues to compensate wholesalers for services rendered to Limited Partners. The Fund's liability for offering costs is limited to the maximum of total offering costs incurred by Campbell & Company or 2.5% of the aggregate subscriptions accepted during the initial and continuous offerings. The Fund is only liable for payment of offering costs on a monthly basis as calculated based on the limitations stated above. At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the Fund reflects a liability in the Statements of Financial Condition for offering costs payable to Campbell & Company of $244,794 and $407,181, respectively. The amount of monthly reimbursement due to Campbell & Company is charged directly to partners' capital. If the Fund terminates prior to completion of payment of the calculated amounts to Campbell & Company, Campbell & Company will not be entitled to any additional payments, and the Fund will have no further obligation to Campbell & Company. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the amount of unreimbursed offering costs incurred by Campbell & Company is $424,681 and $414,245, respectively. G.  Foreign Currency Transactions   The Fund's functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, it transacts business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the Statements of Financial Condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income. H.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04 ("ASU 2011-04") to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  ASU 2011-04 explains how to measure fair value.  It does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The impact of this guidance on the Fund's financial statements and disclosures, if any, is currently being assessed.

        Note 9.  INDEMNIFICATIONS   In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred. The Fund expects the risk of any future obligation under these indemnifications to be remote.

        Note 5.  DEPOSITS WITH INTERBANK MARKET MAKER   The Fund’s counterparties with regard to its forward currency transactions are The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC ("RBS") and UBS AG ("UBS"). The Fund has entered into an International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. agreement with RBS and UBS which governs these transactions. The credit ratings reported by the three major rating agencies for RBS and UBS were considered investment grade as of December 31, 2011. Margin requirements are satisfied by the deposit of U.S. Treasury bills and cash with RBS and UBS. The Fund typically earns interest income on its assets deposited with the RBS and UBS.

        CASH MANAGER AND CUSTODIAN
        Note 3.  CASH MANAGER AND CUSTODIAN   In July 2009, the Fund appointed Wilmington Trust Investment Management LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilmington Trust Corporation, and Horizon Cash Management LLC as cash managers under the Non-Custody Investment Advisory Agreements to manage and control the liquid assets of the Fund. Each cash manager is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC of the United States under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Fund opened custodial accounts at The Northern Trust Company (the "custodian") and has granted the cash managers authority to make certain investments on behalf of the Fund provided such investments are consistent with the investment guidelines created by the general partner. All securities purchased by the cash managers on behalf of the Fund will be held in the Fund's custody accounts at the custodian. The cash managers will have no beneficial or other interest in the securities and cash in such custody accounts.   In December 2010, the Fund terminated the Non-Custody Investment Advisory Agreement with Wilmington Trust Invesment Management LLC as cash manager.
