False Claims Act
With respect to paragraph 7 of this certificate, the U.S. Government is conducting a civil investigation under the False Claims Act into whether originators, depositors, servicers, or trustees of residential mortgage-backed securities (“ RMBS ”) trusts submitted false claims for payment by  government purchasers of RMBS by (1) concealing that the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose; (2) charging RMBS trusts for fraudulent loan processing services, including the preparation of fraudulent mortgage assignments; and (3) failing to ensure that the RMBS trusts paid necessary real estate mortgage investment conduit (“ REMIC ”) taxes.  Certain states may be conducting similar investigations.  The investigation may involve RMBS trusts in which current or former Bank of America affiliates, including BAC Home Loans Servicing LP, Bank of America Mortgage Securities, Inc., Countrywide Financial Corporation, and Bank of America, N.A. as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank, served as originator, depositor, servicer, or trustee.  The U.S. government’s investigation is also considering whether participants in RMBS trusts defrauded federal mortgage insurers, including the Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development by submitting claims for loan guarantee payments on loans for which the trusts lacked collateral documents necessary to foreclose.
Investigations under the federal and most state False Claims Acts may be initiated by the applicable government investigative body or by a qui tam relator’s filing of a False Claims Act complaint under court seal.  If a qui tam relator’s complaint remained under seal, applicable law would restrict our ability to disclose such a fact.
Ocala
Bank of America, National Association is a named party in litigation involving Ocala Funding, LLP.  Information about this litigation is publicly disclosed in Bank of America Corporation’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings.
Fifth Third v. Concord Capital Management et al.
Bank of America, National Association (“ Bank of America ”) was named as a co-defendant in a suit filed in September 2010 by Concord Capital Management LLC and affiliated parties (collectively, “ Concord ”) in the New York State Supreme Court against Bank of America (as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association), Fifth Third Bank (“ Fifth Third ”) and other parties. The suit alleged gross negligence and breach of contract by Bank of America, acting as collateral agent, servicer and, until the transfer of such role to Wilmington Trust Company in February 2009, the trustee, in connection with a life insurance premium-financing loan facility known as “Ultra”, established by Concord and financed by Fifth Third.
In November 2011, Fifth Third filed an amended complaint in Illinois State Court naming Concord, Bank of America and certain other parties, as defendants. Fifth Third’s lawsuit alleges breach of contract and gross negligence by Bank of America based on assertions about Bank of America’s duties substantially similar to those previously made by Concord in New York State Court.
Bank of America’s motion to dismiss against Concord was granted on December 5, 2011. The Fifth Third lawsuit is ongoing.
Nightingale Properties, LLC et al. vs. Bank of America, N.A., et al.
Bank of America was named as a co-defendant with CW Capital Asset Management LLC (“ CWC ”) in suits filed in Tennessee State Court (in February 2011) New York State Court (in August 2011) and Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York (in December 2011) by the Nightingale Group, LLC and related parties (collectively, “ Nightingale ”). Each of the actions arose as a consequence of the default of four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Commercial Mortgage Trust, 2008-C1, and the filing by CWC on behalf of Bank of America of a collection suit in Tennessee against Nightingale and its owners/guarantors, which resulted in a receivership.
The Tennessee and New York State complaints allege libel by CWC, as servicer, allegedly acting as agent of Bank of America, as trustee with respect to the LB-UBS Trust, arising from the publication by CWC of certain statements relating to the guarantee given by Nightingale in support of payment on the four commercial loans in the LB-UBS Trust. The Federal District Court complaint alleges breach of contract, intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, fraud, promissory estoppel and a RICO claim against CWC and Bank of America.

[Letterhead of Bank of America Merrill Lynch]
February 27, 2012
Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria
 
Bank of America, National Association (“ Bank of America ”), as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association, is responsible for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB (17 C.F.R., 229.1122(d)) for the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities for which Bank of America, as trustee, paying agent, or custodian, performed servicing activities (the “ servicing functions ”), which transactions were initially closed on or after January 1, 2006, and that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ Commission ”) pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as well as transactions that were exempt from registration but required an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under Regulation AB as prescribed in applicable transaction agreements (the “ Platform ”).  Bank of America sold all of the transactions on the Platform to U.S. Bank (“ USB ”) on December 30, 2010.  Beginning February 1, 2011, Bank of America began transferring the performance of servicing functions to USB.  Bank of America’s legal obligations with respect to the transactions on the Platform began to succeed to USB on or about January 1, 2011 and continued to transfer throughout the reporting year as conditions for succession were satisfied.  Bank of America used the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB to assess its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria. Bank of America has excluded criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), all of which Bank of America has determined are not applicable to the servicing functions performed by it for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform (the " Inapplicable Criteria ").  With respect to the remaining servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB, as to each transaction that comprises the Platform, management’s assertion covers only the period during which Bank of America performed the applicable servicing function (as to each such transaction, the “ Reporting Period ”), as described in more detail in Appendix A hereto. With respect to Items 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(i)-(iii), management’s assertion covers only certain transactions on the Platform for the Reporting Period (the “ Applicable Transactions ”) and, with respect to Items 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iv) and 1122(d)(4)(xv), management’s assertion covers only certain portions of such criteria for the Reporting Period (the “ Applicable Functions ”), as described in more detail in Appendices C and D hereto (Applicable Transactions and Applicable Functions are collectively referred to as the “ Applicable Transactions and Functions ”).
Except as identified on Appendix B hereto, Bank of America has complied, in all material respects, with the applicable servicing criteria, as may be limited to the Applicable Transactions and Functions identified in Appendices A, C and D hereto, for the Reporting Period, with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on Bank of America’s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Reporting Period.

2 For the period from 1/1/11 to 1/31/11, Bank of America is responsible for reporting on all activities that address the criterion.  For the period from 9/2/11 to 12/31/11, U.S. Bank is responsible for reporting on all activities that address the criterion.  For the period from 2/1/11 to 9/2/2011, Bank of America is responsible for assessing the models relevant to this criterion’s activities for the purpose of reporting on the detection of payment errors arising out of modeling defects with respect to any given transaction for the date specified on Appendix C for such transaction (the “ BANA Responsibilities ”).  U.S. Bank is responsible for reporting on (a) all activities that address this criterion except for the BANA Responsibilities and (b) assessing the models relevant to this criterion’s activities for the purpose of reporting on the detection of payment errors arising out of all modeling defects, with respect to any given transaction after the date specified in Appendix C for such transaction.
  
3 S ee Exhibit C for a list of the Applicable Transactions on the Platform and the Applicable Period for which U.S. Bank is responsible for this criterion.
  
4 U.S. Bank was wholly responsible for this criterion for the period from 9/6/11to 12/31/11.  For the period from 2/1/11 to 9/5/11, U.S. Bank was responsible for ensuring that amounts to be remitted to investors matched instructions provided by U.S. Bank to Bank of America.
  
5 See Exhibit D for a list of the Applicable Transactions on the Platform and the Applicable Period for which U.S. Bank is responsible for this criterion.
  
6 U.S. Bank was wholly responsible for this criterion for the period from 9/6/11to 12/31/11.  For the period from 2/1/11 to 9/5/11, U.S. Bank was responsible for ensuring that credit enhancement payments matched instruction provided by U.S. Bank to Bank of America.
  
  
  
Exhibit B
1.  
Material Instances of Noncompliance – U.S. Bank has identified the following noncompliance with the servicing criteria listed below applicable to the Platform for the Applicable Period:
1122(d)(3)(i)(B) – Certain reports to investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements.
1122(d)(3)(ii) – Amounts due to investors were not allocated and remitted in accordance with timeframes, distribution priority and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements.
2.  
Management Discussion of Noncompliance and Remediation
1122(d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122(d)(3)(ii) - Commencing in 2010 and continuing through 2011, the predecessor trustee engaged a third party (the “Predecessor Trustee Engagement”) to confirm and validate the tools used to calculate payments to bond holders for the Acquired Transactions constituting the majority of the Platform.  The variances and the corresponding restatement of bond holder reports were reported to U.S. Bank, in its successor trustee or successor securities administrator capacity, as applicable.  U.S. Bank as the successor trustee or successor securities administrator then made the identified scripting changes to result in payment allocations (the “Restatement”) that were consistent with the terms of the applicable transaction documents.
Of the Restatements on the Platform in 2011, most were identified through the Predecessor Trustee Engagement and involved script errors contained in the legacy systems acquired from the predecessor trustee which caused various calculations errors and affected the allocation of payments.
 
 
For the Applicable Period, there were also Restatements for Acquired Transactions for payment and/or reporting errors identified outside of the Predecessor Trustee Engagement prior to U.S. Bank implementing various significant controls, as described below.  The majority of the errors causing these restatements were the result of incorrect data loading or processing sequence.
During 2011, additional controls, comparable to those in place for the legacy U.S. Bank platform, were implemented which provide for (1) a monthly independent calculation and review of distribution amounts and other key items affecting the cash flows, and (2) automated controls around processing sequence, data loading, and an automated comparison of cash received to payments made.  The implementation of these controls was fully effective for the Platform by the end of the Applicable Period and should adequately remediate calculation and reporting issues prospectively.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors of Bank of America, National Association:
We have examined Bank of America, National Association's (the "Company"), as successor by merger to LaSalle Bank National Association, compliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities for which the Company, as trustee, paying agent, or custodian, performed servicing activities, which transactions were initially closed on or after January 1, 2006, and that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as well as transactions that were exempt from registration but required an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it under Regulation AB as prescribed in applicable transaction agreements (the "Platform") described in the accompanying Report on Assessment of Compliance with Servicing Criteria (the "Compliance Statement"), for the Reporting Period, as defined in Compliance Statement, excluding criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with respect to the Platform.  Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.
 
 
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  Our examination included testing of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing criteria.  Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report.  Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report.  We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.
 
 
Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(3)(i)(B) of Regulation AB applicable to the Company during the Reporting Period.  Certain reports to investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements.
 
 
In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the preceding paragraph, Bank of America, National Association complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria for the Reporting Period for the Platform, in all material respects.

Exhibit 34.2
 
[Letterhead of Ernst & Young LLP]
 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
The Board of Directors
U.S. Bank National Association
 
We have examined management’s   assertion, included in the accompanying Report on Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria Pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, that U.S. Bank National Association (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122 (d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation AB for the Corporate Trust Asset-Backed Securities   Acquired Platform (the Platform) except for the instances of material noncompliance described therein, as of December 31, 2011, and for the period as defined in management’s assertion on Exhibits A, C and D, except for   servicing criteria 1122 (d)(1)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iv)-(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. The Platform consists of certain securitization transactions (the Acquired Transactions) comprising the majority of the securitization trust administration business of Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America) that the Company acquired on December 30, 2010.  The Acquired Transactions required the Company to perform activities involved in the performance of servicing functions for (i) publicly issued asset-backed and mortgage backed transactions the securities of which were offered on or after January 1, 2006 and (ii) certain asset backed transactions for which the Issuer has voluntarily elected to make Regulation AB compliant filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  For the Acquired Transactions, Bank of America performed the servicing functions for a portion of the reporting period as defined in management’s assertion on Exhibits A, C and D. Management is responsible for the Company’s compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assertion about the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.
 
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company’s compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. Although the Company is responsible for assessing compliance with Items 1122 (d)(1)(ii) and 1122 (d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, there were no servicing activities performed by the Company during the period from February 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011, that required these servicing criteria to be complied with. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria.
 
Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with the servicing criteria 1122 (d)(3)(i)(B) and 1122 (d)(3)(ii) of Regulation AB applicable to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2011:
 
•  
Certain reports to investors did not provide information calculated in accordance with the terms specified in the transaction agreements.
 
•  
Amounts due to investors were not appropriately allocated and remitted in accordance with time frames, distribution priority, and other terms set forth in the transaction agreements.
 
The information in item 2 of Exhibit B of management’s assertion is presented by the Company for informational purposes. Such information has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our examination of management’s assertion as described above and accordingly, we express no opinion on it.
 
In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described in the third paragraph, management’s assertion that the Company complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of December 31, 2011, and for the period   as defined in management’s assertion Exhibits A, C, and D, for the Platform.
