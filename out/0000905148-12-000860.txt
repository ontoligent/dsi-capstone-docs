  Exhibit 33.1
   
  ASSERTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH
  APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA
   
   
  The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware)) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust Company, N.A.), (collectively, the “Company”) provides this platform-level assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria specified in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regard to the servicing platform as of and for the period as follows:
   
  Platform
: Publicly-issued (i.e., transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that comply with Regulation AB for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities.
   
  Period
:  Twelve months ended December 31, 2011 (the “Period”).
   
  Applicable Servicing Criteria
: All servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d), to the extent required by the related transaction agreements as to any transaction, except as set forth in the column titled “Not Applicable To Platform” in Appendix 1 attached hereto.
   
  With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), there were no activities performed during the Period with respect to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.
   
  With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(vi) management has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by these servicing criteria.  Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a “servicer” as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and management has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (“Interpretation 17.06”).  Management has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor’s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor.  Management is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criteria.
   
   
      
 
     
    
 
     
 
 
   
  With respect to the Platform and the Period, the Company provides the following assessment of compliance in respect of the Applicable Servicing Criteria:
   
  1.  The Company is responsible for assessing its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.
   
  2.  The Company has assessed compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above.  In performing this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB.
   
  3.  Based on such assessment, as of and for the Period, the Company has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.
   
  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to the Company’s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of and for the Period.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
   
  The Board of Directors
   The Bank of New York Mellon
 
   BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware
 
  The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A.:
   
  We have examined the accompanying management’s assertion that The Bank of New York Mellon (formerly The Bank of New York), BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware (formerly BNYM (Delaware) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (formerly The Bank of New York Trust, Company, N.A.), (collectively, the “Company”) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulation AB for the publicly issued (i.e. transaction-level reporting initially required under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) asset-backed securities issued on or after January 1, 2006 and like-kind transactions issued prior to January 1, 2006 that are subject to Regulation AB for which the Company provides trustee, securities administration or paying agent services, as defined and to the extent applicable in the transaction agreements, other than residential mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related asset-backed securities (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.  With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(vii), the Company’s Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria indicates that there were no activities performed as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.  Management is responsible for the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment about the Company’s compliance based on our examination.
   
  Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  
and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.  Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report.  Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company’s compliance with the servicing criteria.
   
      
 
     
    
 
     
 
 
   
  As described in the accompanying Assertion of Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria, for servicing criterion 1122 (d)(2)(vi), the Company has engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing criteria. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a “servicer” as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (“Interpretation 17.06”).  As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor’s activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to the vendor. The Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company’s eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.
   
  In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criterion 1122(d)(2)(vi) for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 is fairly stated, in all material respects.
