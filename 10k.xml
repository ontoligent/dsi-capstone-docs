prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP Prior to Golden Star reported to security regulators in Canada Ghana and the U S using financial statements prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles Canadian GAAP with a footnote reconciliation showing financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP However a change in SEC position in late required Canadian companies such as Golden Star which do not qualify as foreign private issuers to file their financial statements in the U S using U S GAAP after December We therefore adopted U S GAAP as of January for all of our subsequent U S Ghanaian and Canadian filings All comparative financial information presented in this Form K is reported in accordance with U S GAAP February NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES In this Form K we use the terms total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce Cost

cost per ounce Total cash cost per ounce We use total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce as key operating indicators We monitor these measures monthly comparing each month s values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies These measures are also compared against budget to alert management of trends that may cause actual results to deviate from planned operational results We provide these measures to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines We calculate these measures for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis Total cash cost per ounce and cash operating cost per ounce should be considered as non GAAP financial measures as defined in SEC Regulation S K Item and in applicable Canadian securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP There are material limitations associated with the use of such non GAAP measures Since these measures do not incorporate revenues changes in working capital and non operating cash costs they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP Changes in numerous factors including but not limited to mining rates processing rates ore grade gold recovery costs of labor consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease We believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance TRENDS AND EVENTS IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER GOLD PRICES While gold prices have generally trended upward during the last ten years from a low of per ounce in to a high of per ounce in September gold prices can fluctuate widely due to several factors such as changes in demand for physical gold forward selling by gold mining companies government actions changes in the value of the U S dollar and global mine production rates We realized per ounce for our gold shipments during the fourth quarter of and per ounce for the full year of ADOPTION OF U S GAAP IN Prior to Golden Star had since its inception reported to security regulators in both Canada and the U S using Canadian GAAP financial statements with a footnote reconciliation to U S GAAP However a change in SEC position in late required that Canadian companies such as Golden Star which do not qualify as foreign private issuers must file their financial statements in the U S using U S GAAP beginning in In response we adopted U S GAAP as of January for all subsequent reporting in the U S Canada and Ghana INCREASES IN MINING COSTS While gold prices have trended sharply upward in recent years the industry has also experienced steady increases in mine operating costs including the costs of fuel electric power labor explosives mining equipment equipment maintenance parts and chemicals consumed in the processing plants In addition many governments around the world have increased mineral royalties fees and income tax rates in recent years Mining is an energy intensive industry using significant quantities of electricity and fuel in the mining transport crushing grinding and processing of ores and as a result a mine s cost structure is sensitive to changes in fuel and electric power costs Increases in crude oil prices from per barrel in early to in excess of per barrel in late have thus contributed to higher mining costs worldwide Increasing fuel costs have also resulted in higher electric power in many areas including Ghana The resource boom of recent years has constrained availability of skilled mining personnel which in turn has put upward pressure on labor costs It has also contributed to increases in mining equipment costs and long lead times for new orders An analysis of cash operating costs of competitors mines in Africa North America and South America as reported in their public financial reporting documents show that on average cash operating costs in the first nine months of were up over the first nine months of While these various companies may apply differing cost accounting procedures this analysis is an indication of recent trends in gold mining costs INCREASES IN TAXATION AND ROYALTIES During several countries announced increases or intent to increase mineral royalty rates income tax rates and fees applicable to mining operations including Australia Peru Bolivia Chile Tanzania Ecuador Mali Brazil Burkina Faso and Ghana In early Ghana raised its royalty rates on gold mines from to and which was a major factor in the increase in the royalties paid by our mines in as compared to In late the Government of Ghana proposed a number of changes to the mining fiscal regime for which if implemented will likely result in an increase in corporate tax payable by mining companies in Ghana The Government of Ghana has indicated that in the corporate income tax rate will increase from to for mining companies and capital allowances tax depreciation will be deductible at a flat rate of over a five year period instead of an deduction in the year that the capital spending was incurred In addition the Government proposed to disallow expenditures from one mining area as a deduction from revenues in a separate mining area belonging to the same company in determining the company s taxable income The Government also announced its intent to introduce a windfall profit tax on mining companies in The details of these tax changes have not been made available and we are thus not able to determine the impact of these new taxes on our operations at this time Moreover the Ghana Government announced in late that it intends to establish a tax stability renegotiation team which plans to review the existing tax stability agreements of mining companies operating in Ghana While our mines do not have tax stability agreements it is not clear at this time if the tax stability renegotiation team will review out Deeds of Warranty which specify certain tax agreements for our properties CONVERTIBLE DEBT Our million convertible debentures mature on November We have the option to settle this liability in cash payment or subject to certain limitations in common shares See the Liquidity Outlook section below for additional details of the settlement alternatives for this debt RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO Consolidated Results Consolidated financial results include a net loss attributable to Golden Star of million or per share which was improved over a net loss attributable to Golden Star of million or per share in While the number of ounces sold was down from s level and operating costs were higher rising gold prices during yielded an increase in revenues that exceeded the impact of lower ounces and higher operating costs Realized gold prices averaged per ounce during up from per ounce in Lower ore grades and less tonnes of ore processed at both Bogoso and at Wassa contributed to the loss as did higher cash operating costs at both operations Consolidated cash operating costs totaled million up from million in The increase in cash operating costs reflects significant increases in prices of many of our key operating inputs including the prices paid for electric power labor cyanide fuel and other reagents used in processing plants Higher cash operating costs also reflect an increase in waste mining activities in as compared to See Bogoso s operational discussion below for more details on cost increases Depreciation charges in were down million from due to lower ounces sold at Bogoso and at Wassa and due to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense per ounce from the increase in gold reserves at the end of SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Gold sales oz Average realized gold price oz Revenues in thousands Cash flow provided by operations in thousands Net income loss attributable to Golden Star in thousands Net income loss per share attributable to Golden Star basic Gold hedging activities during resulted in a loss of million up from a million loss in Most of these losses were related to forward gold price contracts which lost value during the year as gold prices rose See Note of the attached financial statements for additional discussion of the gold forward contracts Offsetting the gold derivative losses in was a million gain on fair value of the option feature in our convertible debentures The gain was in response to lower prices of our common shares which resulted in a lower value of the option feature In comparison we recorded a million loss on the fair value of the conversion feature of our convertible debentures in in response to rising prices for our common shares See Note of the attached financial statements for additional disclosure on fair value adjustments to our convertible debentures Interest expense totaled million in down marginally from million in reflecting lower balances on our equipment financing loans during as loan balances were paid down Corporate general and administrative costs totaled million in up from million in Most of the increase was related to one time corporate advisory and consulting fees totaling million increases in non cash stock compensation expense addition of a technical services group and higher option and personnel costs The consulting expense was related to an independent review performed at our mine sites to improve production processes and to lower operating costs This project was competed in and we do not expect to commission similar studies in The increase in income tax expense from reflects higher income in Ghana at Wassa Bogoso Prestea Operations Compared to BOGOSO PRESTEA OPERATING RESULTS Ore mined refractory t Ore mined non refractory t Total ore mined t Waste mined t Refractory ore processed t Refractory ore grade g t Gold recovery refractory ore Non refractory ore processed t Non refractory ore grade g t Gold recovery non refractory ore Gold sales oz Cash operating cost oz Royalties oz Total cash cost oz Bogoso Prestea s revenues totaled in up from million in the same period of While the number of ounces sold was lower than in increases in realized gold prices during more than offset the impact of lower ounces Bogoso s realized gold price averaged per ounce during up from per ounce a year earlier Bogoso sold ounces in down from ounces in Decreases in tonnes processed and lower plant feed grade were the major factors contributing to the drop in ounces sold The decrease in grade as compared to reflects a change in ore source In Bogoso s main feed source was the higher grade Buesichem pit but mining was completed at the Buesichem pit in the third quarter of and subsequently Bogoso moved its mining fleet to other pits at Bogoso where ore grades have been lower than at Buesichem The drop in tonnes processed as compared to reflects lower availability of ore in recent quarters as we pursued an accelerated waste stripping program at the Chujah pit to allow a more steady supply of ore in subsequent periods Bogoso s cash operating costs totaled million during up from million in The largest item contributing to Bogoso s increase in cash operating costs was a million tonne increase in waste tonnes mined which resulted in higher equipment rental costs additional equipment maintenance costs and additional equipment operating costs Increases in the price of electric power fuel cyanide and labor as compared to also contributed to higher operating costs as did higher maintenance expense than a year earlier More specifically in late the actual price we paid for mine truck tires was up from a year earlier Similarly the price we paid for electricity was higher our fuel price was up explosives were up and the cost of cyanide was up A decrease in the number of ounces sold and higher cash operating costs resulted in a per ounce cash operating cost in up from per ounce during Bogoso s royalty costs were higher than a year earlier due to higher revenues and an increase in the government of Ghana s royalty rate from in to in The drop in ounces sold contributed to lower units of production amortization expense as did an increase in gold reserves at the end of Cost analysis and cost control planning was a major focus at all operational sites during and implementation of the new cost control programs are expected in early As part of the cost control efforts we carried out an extensive mine planning exercise in late to determine the the optimum sequencing of the future Bogoso Prestea pits to provide a steady long term flow of oxide and sulfide ore to the Bogoso oxide and sulfide processing plants Mining of oxide ore was initiated at the Pampe pit west of Bogoso late in the third quarter of and the Bogoso oxide plant was brought on line in the first quarter of In addition we received final permits required to begin recovery and re processing old Bogoso tails materials through the Bogoso oxide plant Based on these new developments we now expect that the combination of Pampe oxide ore and the recovery of oxidized tailings will allow continuous or near continuous oxide plant operating throughout and beyond Since the processing costs of oxide ores are typically lower than for other ore types at Bogoso Prestea we expect reductions in average cash operating costs per ounce in as compared to We expect that sulfide mining rates will be lower than in with a lower strip ratio and we expect an increase in sulfide ore tonnes processed Sulfide gold recovery rates should remain near the rate established in the second half of While sulfide feed grades are expected to drop below levels expected increases in processing rates and recovery should more than offset this resulting in an increase in ounces sold versus Resumption of operations at the oxide processing plant should also contribute to higher gold sales in During the Prestea Underground mine remained on a care and maintenance basis In late our new Technical Services Group began a Pre feasibility study to evaluate economic potential of developing the Prestea Underground mine using mechanized mining methods Wassa HBB Operations Compared to WASSA HBB OPERATING RESULTS Ore mined t Waste mined t Ore processed t Ore grade processed g t Recovery Gold sales oz Cash operating cost oz Royalties oz Total cash cost oz Wassa sold ounces during down from ounces in A drop in ore grade to g t from g t in was the major factor contributing to the reduction in ounces sold Ore grades fell as mining proceeded into lower grade areas of the Wassa and HBB ore bodies during Higher realized gold prices offset the impact of lower ounces sold to yield revenues of million up from million in Wassa s realized gold price averaged per ounce during up from per ounce a year earlier Cash operating costs totaled million in up from million in Increases in the price of electric power fuel cyanide labor and maintenance contributed to higher operating costs See the Bogoso discussion of costs immediately above for additional details on increases in the price of key items consumed in our operations The drop in ounces sold as compared to coupled with higher cash operating costs resulted in an increase in cash operating cost per ounce to as compared to per ounce in Mining operations were completed at Benso in February and we plan to increase mining rates at the Wassa area pits to compensate for the Benso closure While the Wassa pits should make up for the Benso tonnage Wassa ore grades are lower than what has been mined at Benso and this will result in lower overall feed grades and lower gold output at Wassa HBB in as compared to The new Father Brown pit at Hwini Butre came on line in the fourth quarter of replacing ore from other Hwini Butre pits that were closed upon completion of mining It is expected that the remaining life of the Hwini Butre mining operation is now approximately two to two and one half years after which all or most of the ore feed to the Wassa plant will come from Wassa area pits During Hwini Butre should provide approximately of the Wassa plant ore tonnes at an average grade of approximately g t The balance of the Wassa plant feed is expected to come from Wassa area pits RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO Consolidated Results Consolidated financial results include a net loss attributable to Golden Star of million or per share as compared to a net loss attributable to Golden Star of million or per share in While gold prices were higher than in a drop in ounces sold combined with an increase in cost of sales to yield a million drop in mine operating margin to million down from million in But a smaller loss from changes in the fair value of the convertible debentures and lower interest expense combined to produce a million pre tax loss for down from a pre tax loss of million in In both and the loss from changes in the fair value of the convertible debentures was caused by increasing share prices for our common stock which resulted in an increase in the value of the conversion feature of the debentures and an increase in the amount of our liability associated with the outstanding debentures The loss in was much less than in simply because the increase on our share price in was much less than the increase during Our consolidated tax expense was million as compared to an million tax benefit in The benefit was a result of recognizing Wassa s deferred tax assets at the end of upon transfer of the HBB mining leases to Wassa and improved operational performance at Wassa The million tax expense in reflects the ongoing use of Wassa s tax assets to offset taxable income and the cost of a temporary tax levy in Ghana Gold sales totaled ounces in down from ounces sold in The major factors contributing to the decrease in gold sold were lower gold recovery at Bogoso and lower ore grades at Wassa Realized gold prices averaged per ounce during up from per ounce in Wassa processed essentially the same tonnes in as in but ore grades were lower than in as mining moved into lower grade areas of the Benso and Hwini Butre ore bodies during In contrast Bogoso processed higher grade ore during than in but its gold output was adversely impacted by lower gold recoveries during most of the year Lower gold recovery at Bogoso was related to a change in ore sources during the year In and the first quarter of Bogoso s main ore source was fresh ore from deep in the Buesichem pit which yielded good recoveries By mid the Buesichem pit was exhausted and Bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the Chujah Main pit where mining in the initial benches encountered partially oxidized ore which yielded lower flotation recovery of the gold Bogoso initiated mining at the Bogoso North pit in October to supplement the Chujah Main pit ore See additional discussion of Wassa and Bogoso s operations below Our general and administrative expense was million up million over the level The increase was mostly due to higher community development spending in Ghana and to higher stock based compensation expense The corporate office overhead expense excluding stock based compensation expense was up from Property holding costs are primarily the costs incurred in care and maintenance activities at the Prestea Underground project Bogoso Prestea Operations Compared to Bogoso Prestea gold shipments totaled ounces in at an average gold price of per ounce down from ounces in at an average price of per ounce While plant feed grades and total tonnes processed were marginally higher in a drop in gold recovery resulted in lower gold output The drop in refractory ore gold recovery to in from in was related to a change in ore sources during the year In and the first quarter of Bogoso s main feed source was fresh ore from deep in the Buesichem pit which yielded good recoveries But by mid the Buesichem pit was exhausted and Bogoso moved its main mining fleet to the Chujah Main pit where mining encountered partially oxidized ore at shallow levels resulting in lower flotation recovery of the gold Bogoso also processed stockpiled transition ores at various times late in which also contributed to lower gold recovery rates The Bogoso North pit was opened in the fourth quarter of to provide additional ore Unusually heavy rainfall in the second half of and de watering issues impeded mining operations and pit scheduling at both Chujah and Bogoso North The Bogoso sulfide plant processed refractory ore throughout the year and in various periods the oxide plant was operated to provide additional refractory concentrate to the bio oxidation circuit In the fourth quarter of the oxide plant processed oxide ore from a small stockpile accumulated from sundry sources over the past few quarters Bogoso Prestea s cash operating costs totaled million in up from million in Higher electric power fuel cyanide and labor costs were the key items responsible for Bogoso s cost increase Higher cash operating costs coupled with lower gold output pushed cash operating costs to per ounce up from per ounce in The current portion of Bogoso s asset retirement obligation increased in due to the need to back fill the Plant North pit at Prestea and to rehabilitate the associated waste rock dump site These two items are expected to cost approximately million during Wassa HBB Operations Compared to While Wassa processed essentially the same number of tonnes of ore in as it did in ore grades and gold recovery were lower resulting in lower gold sales In addition Wassa experienced increases in its cash operating costs the effects of which were offset by higher gold prices Wassa sold ounces in at an average realized gold price of per ounce as compared to ounces at an average realized price of per ounce in Lower plant feed grade in reflected a transition of mining into lower grade areas of the Benso and Hwini Butre pits during Cash operating costs rose to million in up from million in Increases in labor fuel explosives and electric power accounted for most of the increase over levels Also as Wassa ramped up its mining effort at Benso and Hwini Butre during it incurred higher costs for contract mining ore haulage costs and equipment rental than in Wassa HBB moved a total of million tonnes of ore and waste in as compared to million tonnes in The higher cash costs and lower gold sales contributed to a cash operating cost of per ounce in as compared to per ounce in Lower gold production resulted in lower depreciation and amortization costs which were down million from DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS PAMPE AND THE BOGOSO OXIDE PLANT REFURBISHMENT During the third quarter of we restarted mining operations at the Pampe oxide property located kilometers west of the Bogoso processing plant site It is expected that Pampe oxide ores will be less expensive to process than the Bogoso sulfide ores and should yield better gold recovery rates Pampe oxide ore was stockpiled during the balance of and the Bogoso oxide plant began processing the ore in February In anticipation of the Pampe oxide ore the oxide plant was refurbished in BOGOSO TAILINGS RECOVERY PROJECT Construction continued at Bogoso on our hydraulic tailings recovery system which is designed to feed tailings from decommissioned Bogoso tailings storage facilities directly into the Bogoso oxide plant s CIL circuit The final environmental permit needed for start up was received in October While the grade of the tailings material is lower than that of the ores typically treated in the Bogoso oxide plant in the past operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings can be fed directly into the existing CIL circuit without crushing or grinding Thus ore processing costs will be lower than for freshly mined ore resulting in lower overall average costs per ounce at Bogoso It is expected that this material will be a supplemental feed to oxide ores mined from Pampe and later from Prestea South once mining is initiated there later in PRESTEA SOUTH PROPERTIES During we continued to seek environmental permits required to develop the Prestea South oxide deposits In the Ghana EPA requested an update to the Prestea South Project Environmental Impact Statement EIS and a revised draft EIS was submitted to the EPA in April When the environmental permits are obtained we expect to initiate development at Prestea South deposits including its kilometer haul road extension We plan to transport Prestea South oxide ore to Bogoso and process it through the Bogoso oxide plant Prestea South sulfide ore will be processed through the Bogoso sulfide plant EXPLORATION PROJECTS Exploration expenditures totaled approximately million during up from million in The exploration programs concentrated on drilling at Buesichem South Bogoso North Chujah and Pampe at Bogoso Prestea and resource delineation drilling at Wassa HBB The Wassa area program focused on resource extensions along strike and at depth We also drill tested various zones at Hwini Butre including underground targets at Father Brown There were no exploration activities at the Prestea Underground in but we continued with engineering studies to assess the economic potential of resuming underground mining activities Exploration activities continued on our Niger properties where AMI Resources who is party to an earn in agreement continued drilling at Deba and Tialkam In Burkina Faso Riverstone Resources which has an option to purchase the Goulagou and Rounga properties also carried out a drilling program In February Riverstone Resources exercised their purchase option and acquired our Burkina Faso properties Exploration activity was limited in Sierra Leone and Cote D Ivoire during due to license issues and political instability respectively in these two areas In South America exploration efforts concentrated on the Iriri Joint Venture in northern Mato Grosso state in Brazil where we have the ability to earn a ownership position in a square kilometer land package held by Votorantim Metals The Iriri Joint Venture is a green fields project encompassing regional wide spaced soil and stream sediment sampling During sampling programs covered approximately of the square kilometer area with the remaining area to be sampled in after the seasonal rains end The Saramacca property located in Suriname consists of three concessions totaling approximately square kilometers In Newmont Mining Corporation Newmont earned a interest in the Saramacca project by having spent million on exploration and has since taken over management of the project Also in we entered into an agreement with Newmont to sell them our remaining interest in the Saramacca joint venture for approximately million subject to the Government of Suriname s transfer of ownership of the exploration license to Newmont The joint venture has continued work on the property since that date investing a further million in drilling and development Newmont has spent the past two years seeking transfer of the license but the government of Suriname has still not agreed to the transfer In the interim Newmont submitted a feasibility study to the Government of Suriname in requesting conversion of the prospecting licenses to an exploitation license and discussions on this request are also on going When the license transfer is completed we expect to receive the million purchase price which is currently being held in escrow Exploration Plans We have budgeted approximately million for exploration activities in much of which will be focused on resource definition at Wassa and further drill testing of the Father Brown underground potential at Hwini Butre The exploration programs at Wassa were successful in identifying and delineating higher grade zones below the current pits designs and as a result this higher grade material could allow the existing Wassa pits to go deeper than initially expected The Wassa drilling program will incorporate pit optimization planning to help focus drilling in areas where higher grade material may provide the best economics and pit shell expansions The drilling at the Father Brown underground targets will focus on testing extensions of the mineralization along strike and at depth We expect that during West African exploration programs outside of Ghana will include deep auger drilling at our Amelekia concessions in Cote D Ivoire Our Sonfon project in Sierra Leone will remain on care and maintenance until the license issue with the government has been resolved The South American exploration effort will focus on the Iriri Joint Venture in Brazil as well as the transfer of the Saramacca licenses in Suriname to Newmont The Iriri Joint Venture programs plan to concentrate on finishing the regional stream sediment sampling programs over the remaining area not covered in our sampling program Upon completion of the wide spaced surface sampling program follow up sampling programs will be designed to explore any identified anomalies Our current plan is to have several soil anomalies delineated by the end of the which can become drilling targets in subsequent years LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Consolidated cash operating margin Gold revenues less the cash components of cost of goods sold as found in Note to the attached financial statements totaled million during This cash was used to cover various non operating costs and changes in working capital during bringing cash from operations to million for the full year Non operating uses of cash included million for reclamation projects for corporate general and administrative costs million used to settle gold forward sales contracts million for working capital needs for non mine site exploration costs and property holding costs We expect cash requirements for many of these cost items will decrease in The unusually large reclamation spending in was mostly related to backfilling of Plant North pit at Prestea The backfilling was completed by the end of and we expect a significant reduction in reclamation spending in Similarly most of the cash used in working capital during was related to increases in ore stockpiles in the fourth quarter Furthermore all gold forward purchase contracts expired in and thus will not require cash payments in And lastly corporate general and administrative costs included a large one time consulting project and as a result we expect lower costs here as well in A total of million was used in investing activities during including million on mining property development projects and million for the acquisition of new equipment and facilities at the mine sites Major capital items during included new mining equipment development drilling at the operating mine sites tailing dam enhancements a new water treatment plant at Bogoso processing plant enhancements capitalization of pre stripping costs and costs of the tailings reclaim project at Bogoso Scheduled debt payments on our equipment financing facility used million of cash and new borrowings on this facility provided million of cash While the mines provided sufficient cash to meet all of our operating and non operating needs during investing activities were essentially funded by a reduction in cash on hand bringing our cash balance down from million at December to million at December During all of our cash was held as cash or was invested in funds that held only U S treasury notes and bonds LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK We expect to spend up to million on capital projects at Bogoso Prestea and Wassa HBB during In addition we expect to spend million on rehabilitation projects at Bogoso Prestea and Wassa HBB during The major planned capital projects in include a new tailings pond facility at Wassa a water treatment plant at Bogoso new mining equipment additional mine development drilling and upgrades to the Bogoso sulfide plant We plan to use approximately million of cash for payments on the equipment financing loans and we expect to draw approximately million on new equipment loans in to replace mining equipment During we plan to pay million of interest on our equipment financing facility and million of interest payments on the convertible debentures As of December the company had a negative working capital position of million which includes cash of million and a current liability for our convertible debenture of million Our convertible debentures due in November became a current liability in the fourth quarter of which caused our current liabilities to exceed current assets The options available to settle this liability include cash re financing of the debt payment in common shares or a combination of shares and cash While it is our current intent to redeem these debentures with cash in November or depending upon market conditions refinance the debentures using long term debt the debentures contain a provision for settlement in common shares On maturity we may at our option satisfy the repayment obligation by paying the full million principal amount of the Debentures in cash or alternatively by issuing up to million common shares to the debenture holders If we opt to settle in shares we must redeem all and not less than all of the debentures by issuing up to million shares The value assigned to the shares issued will be determined as of the weighted average trading price of our common shares on the NYSE Amex stock exchange for the consecutive trading days ending five trading days preceding the maturity date If the value assigned to the shares multiplied by million shares is insufficient to cover the entire million liability we would be required to pay cash in addition to the shares issued in an amount that when added to the value of the shares will equal million If required the share issuance option would not impact our cash position to the extent shares are used to retire the debt We also maintain a million revolving line of credit which had nil outstanding at December This revolving credit facility expires on September We also have million of borrowing capacity at December under our equipment financing credit facility which has an indefinite life We expect that our operating cash flow along with cash on hand at December and the equipment financing facility will be sufficient to cover capital operating and debt needs during However since our operating cash flows are sensitive to fluctuations in gold price a prolonged down turn in gold price could adversely impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our needs during LOOKING AHEAD Our main objectives for include start up Bogoso s oxide processing plant early in using Pampe ore and later in begin feeding Bogoso tailings materials achieve reductions in operating costs throughout the organization continue exploration drilling at the Wassa mining lease to follow up on the drilling results complete Prestea Underground pre feasibility study and if warranted prepare a development and financing plan and re evaluation of all mining plans and equipment needs for continued longer term profitable operation We are estimating a Bogoso Prestea gold production of to ounces at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce We expect Wassa to produce approximately to ounces during at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce with combined total production of approximately to ounces at an average cash operating cost of to per ounce As more fully disclosed in the Risk Factors in Item A of this Form K numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans Under any of these circumstances the estimates described above could change materially ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS See Item Description of Properties Mining in Ghana for a description of environmental laws and regulations and for a discussion of our social and economic development activities in Ghana RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS We obtained legal services from a legal firm to which one of our board members is of Counsel The total value of all services purchased from this law firm during and was million and million respectively Our board member did not personally perform any legal services for us during the period nor did he benefit directly or indirectly from payments for the services performed by the firm CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our accounting policies under U S GAAP are described in Note of our consolidated financial statements Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses Accounting policies relating to asset impairments depreciation and amortization of mining property plant and equipment stock based compensation tax assets determination of fair values of financial instruments and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves gold recoveries future gold prices future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities Preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses Accounting policies relating to asset impairments depreciation and amortization of mining property plant and equipment stock based compensation tax assets determination of fair values of financial instruments and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves gold recoveries future gold prices future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities Decisions to write off or not to write off all or a portion of our investment in various properties especially exploration properties subject to impairment analysis are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases Certain exploration properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in prior years We continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value Listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset liability revenue or expense being reported Ore stockpiles Stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing Stockpiles are measured by physical surveys or by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile during a period The number of recoverable ounces of gold in stockpiles is based on assay data and the gold recovery rate expected when the ore is processed Stockpile values include mining and mine maintenances costs incurred in bringing the ore to the stockpile and also a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation depletion and amortization relating to mining operations Costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average cost per tonne of the total stockpile Stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the processing plant A adjustment to the volume of the stockpile based on typical stockpile tonnage would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately to million Impairment charges We periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset An asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset The determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future including gold prices operating costs production levels gold recovery rates reclamation spending ore reserves amounts of recoverable gold and capital expenditures Amortization Capital expenditures for mining properties mine development and certain property plant and equipment items are amortized using a units of production method over Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve ounces of gold Capital expenditures that benefit an entire mining property such as the cost of building an administrative facility are amortized over all ounces contained on the property Capital expenditures that benefit only a specific asset such as the pre production stripping costs of a pit are amortized over only the ounces located in the associated pit Reserve estimates which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs future gold prices continuity of mineralization future gold recovery rates spatial configuration of gold deposits and other factors that may prove to be incorrect A adjustment in estimated total December reserves at Wassa and at Bogoso Prestea could result in an approximately million annual change in amortization expense Tax assets Recognition of future tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits Determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variable including but not limited to gold prices operating costs gold recovery ore reserves gold production ore grades administrative costs tax rates and potential changes in tax laws Asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures Accounting for future reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mine site of future reclamation and closure costs In many cases a majority of such costs are incurred at the end of a mine s life which can be several years in the future Such estimates are subject to changes in mine plans reclamation requirements inflation rates and technology As a result future reclamation and closure costs are difficult to estimate Our estimates of future reclamation and closing cost are reviewed frequently and are adjusted as needed to reflect new information about the timing and expected future costs of our environmental disturbances Based upon our current situation we estimate that a increases in total future reclamation and closure cash costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS See Note to the financial statements attached below this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adoption of U S GAAP in Golden Star has since its inception reported to security regulators in both Canada and the U S using Canadian GAAP financial statements with a foot note reconciliation to U S GAAP However a change in SEC position in late required that after Canadian companies such as Golden Star which do not qualify as foreign private issuers file their financial statements in the U S using U S GAAP after In response we adopted U S GAAP for years beginning on or after January for all future U S Ghanaian and Canadian regulatory filings OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have no off balance sheet arrangements TABLE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Payment due in millions by period Total Less than Year to years to years More than Years Debt Interest on long term debt Operating lease obligations Capital lease obligations Asset retirement obligations Total Includes million of convertible debentures maturing in November Golden Star has the right to repay the million in cash or in common shares at the due date under certain circumstances The presentation shown above assumes payment is made in cash and also assumes no conversions of the debt to common shares by the holders prior to the maturity date Asset retirement obligations include estimates about future reclamation costs mining schedules timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves an analysis of which determines the ultimate closure date and impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities The discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as Asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet of million as of December The amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA February As of February we had outstanding common shares options to acquire common shares and convertible notes which are convertible into common shares Our exposure to market risk includes but is not limited to the following risks changes in interest rates on our debt changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Our convertible senior unsecured debentures and the outstanding loans under our equipment financing facility bear interest at a fixed rate and are not subject to gains or losses in interest rate Our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate of the higher of the applicable lender s cost of funds capped at per annum above LIBOR and LIBOR plus a margin of As of December there was a nil balance outstanding on this facility We have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Currency risk is risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates In addition the value of cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates Since our revenues are denominated in U S dollars and our operating units transact much of their business in U S dollars we are typically not subject to significant impacts from currency fluctuations Even thus certain purchases of labor operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in Ghana cedis euros British pounds Australian dollars and South African rand To accommodate these purchases we maintain operating cash accounts in non US dollar currencies and appreciation of these non US dollar currencies against the U S dollar results in a foreign currency gain and a decrease in non U S dollar currencies results in a loss In the past we have entered into forward purchase contracts for South African rand euros and other currencies to hedge expected purchase costs of capital assets During and we had no currency related derivatives At December and we held million and million respectively of foreign currency Commodity Price Risk Gold is our primary product and as a result changes in the price of gold significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows Based on our expected gold production in a per ounce change in gold price would result in approximately a million change in our sales revenues and operating cash flows To reduce gold price volatility we have at various times entered into gold price derivatives At December and December we did not hold any gold price derivatives and thus there were no financial instruments subject to gold price risk at those dates We held gold price derivatives at various times during and Information on these gold price derivatives can be found in Note of our financial statements Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset We manage the liquidity risk inherent in these financial obligations by preparing quarterly forecasts and annual long term budgets which forecast cash needs and expected cash availability to meet future obligations Typically these obligations are met by cash flows from operations and from cash on hand Scheduling of capital spending and acquisitions of financial resources may also be employed as needed and as available to meeting the cash demands of our obligations Our ability to repay or refinance our future obligations depends on a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control Factors that influence our ability to meet these obligations include general global economic conditions credit and capital market conditions results of operations and the price of gold Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation Our credit risk is primarily associated with liquid financial assets and derivatives We limit exposure to credit risk on liquid financial assets by holding our cash cash equivalents restricted cash and deposits at highly rated financial institutions and during all of our excess cash was invested in funds that hold only U S treasury bills We mitigate the credit risks of our derivatives by entering into derivative contracts with only high quality counter parties Risks associated with gold trade receivables is considered minimal as we sell gold to a credit worthy buyer who settles promptly within a week of receipt of gold bullion ITEM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders of Golden Star

OF OPERATIONS Through our owned subsidiary Golden Star Bogoso Prestea Ltd GSBPL we own and operate the Bogoso Prestea gold mining and processing operation Bogoso Prestea located near the town of Bogoso Ghana Through our owned subsidiary Golden Star Wassa Ltd GSWL we also own and operate the Wassa gold mine Wassa located approximately kilometers east of Bogoso Prestea Wassa mines ore from pits near the Wassa plant and also processes ore mined at our Hwini Butre and Benso HBB mines located south of Wassa We hold interests in several gold exploration projects in Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa including Niger and Côte d Ivoire and in South America we hold and manage exploration properties in Brazil and Suriname BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND LIQUIDITY RISK Golden Star Resources Ltd Golden Star or Company is a Canadian federally incorporated international gold mining and exploration company headquartered in the United States U S Prior to Golden Star reported to security regulators in Canada Ghana and the U S using financial statements prepared in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles Canadian GAAP with a footnote reconciliation showing financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP However a change in SEC position in late required Canadian companies such as Golden Star which do not qualify as foreign private issuers to file their financial statements in the U S using U S GAAP after December We therefore adopted U S GAAP as of January for all of our subsequent U S Ghanaian and Canadian filings All comparative financial information presented in these consolidated financial statements is reported in accordance with U S GAAP These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries whether owned directly or indirectly All inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated Subsidiaries are defined as entities in which the company holds a controlling interest is the general partner or where it is subject to the majority of expected losses or gains Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and discharge of all liabilities in the normal course of business With the exception of a few exploration offices the functional currency including the Ghanaian operations is the U S dollar As of December the company had a negative working capital position of million which includes cash of million and a current liability for our convertible debenture of million measured at fair value of million at December Our convertible debentures due on November became a current liability in the fourth quarter of which caused our current liabilities to exceed current assets The options available to settle this liability include cash re financing of the debt payment in common shares or a combination of shares and cash While it is our current intent to redeem the debentures with cash in November or depending upon market conditions refinance the debentures using long term debt the debentures contain a provision for settlement in common shares On maturity we may at our option satisfy the repayment obligation by paying the full million principal amount of the Debentures in cash or alternatively by issuing up to million common shares to the debenture holders If we opt to settle in shares we must redeem all and not less than all of the debentures by issuing up to million shares The value assigned to the shares issued will be determined as of the weighted average trading price of our common shares on the NYSE Amex stock exchange for the consecutive trading days ending five trading days preceding the maturity date If the value assigned to the shares multiplied by million shares is insufficient to cover the entire million liability we would be required to pay cash in addition to the shares issued in an amount that when added to the value of the shares will equal million If required the share issuance option would not impact our cash position to the extent shares are used to retire the debt SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USE OF ESTIMATES Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets liabilities deferred tax liabilities and expenses The more significant areas requiring the use of estimates include asset impairments valuation of convertible debentures stock based compensation depreciation and amortization of assets and site reclamation and closure accruals Accounting for these areas is subject to estimates and assumptions regarding among other things ore reserves gold recoveries future gold prices future operating costs asset usage rates and future mining activities Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances However actual results may differ from our estimates CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash includes cash deposits in any currency residing in checking accounts money market funds and sweep accounts Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less Investments with maturities greater than three months and up to one year are classified as short term investments while those with maturities in excess of one year are classified as long term investments Cash equivalents and short term investments are stated at cost which typically approximates market value INVENTORIES Inventory classifications include stockpiled ore in process inventory finished goods inventory and materials and supplies All of our inventories except materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or market The stated value of all production inventories include direct production costs and attributable overhead and depreciation incurred to bring the materials to their current point in the processing cycle General and administrative costs for corporate offices are not included in any inventories Stockpiled ore represents coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is waiting processing Stockpiled ore is measured by estimating the number of tonnes via truck counts or by physical surveys added to or removed from the stockpile the number of contained ounces based on assay data and estimated gold recovery percentage Stockpiled ore value is based on the costs incurred including depreciation and amortization in bringing the ore to the stockpile Costs are added to the stockpiled ore based on current mining costs per tonne and are removed at the average cost per tonne of ore in the stockpile In process inventory represents material that is currently being treated in the processing plants to extract the contained gold and to transform it into a saleable product The amount of gold in the in process inventory is determined by assay and by measure of the quantities of the various gold bearing materials in the recovery process The in process gold is valued at the average of the beginning inventory and the cost of material fed into the processing stream plus in process conversion costs including applicable mine site overhead depreciation and amortization related to the processing facilities Finished goods inventory is composed of saleable gold in the form of doré bars that have been poured but not yet shipped from the mine site The bars are valued at the lower of total cost or net realizable value Included in the total costs are the direct costs of the mining and processing operations as well as direct mine site overhead amortization and depreciation Material and supply inventories consist mostly of equipment parts fuel lubricants and reagents consumed in the mining and ore processing activities Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ORE RESERVE QUANTITIES USED IN UNITS OF PRODUCTION AMORTIZATION Gold ounces contained in stockpiled ore are excluded from total reserves when determining units of production amortization of mining property asset retirement assets and other assets PROPERTY ACQUISITION EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS The initial acquisition costs of exploration and mining properties are capitalized Subsequent exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until such time as a feasibility study has been completed which establishes in compliance with SEC Industry Standard Guide that proven and probable reserves exist on the property After proven and probable reserves have been established subsequent exploration and development costs are capitalized until such time as a property is placed in service Following a property s in service date accumulated capitalized acquisition exploration and development costs are reclassified as Mining Property assets and are subject to amortization on a units of production basis when metal production begins PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property plant and equipment assets including machinery processing equipment mining equipment mine site facilities buildings vehicles and expenditures that extend the life of such assets are recorded at cost including acquisition and installation costs The costs of self constructed assets include direct construction costs direct overhead and allocated interest during the construction phase Indirect overhead costs are not included in the cost of self constructed assets Depreciation for mobile equipment and other assets having estimated lives shorter than the estimated life of the ore reserves is calculated using the straight line method at rates which depreciate the cost of the assets less their anticipated residual values if any over their estimated useful lives Mobile mining equipment is amortized over a five year life Assets such as processing plants power generators and buildings which have an estimated life equal to or greater than the estimated life of the ore reserves are amortized over the life of the proven and probable reserves of the associated mining property using a units of production amortization method The net book value of property plant and equipment assets is charged against income if the mine site is abandoned and it is determined that the assets cannot be economically transferred to another project or sold MINING PROPERTIES Mining property assets including property acquisition costs tailings dams mine site drilling costs where proven and probable reserves have been established pre production waste stripping condemnation drilling roads feasibility studies and wells are recorded at cost The costs of self constructed assets include direct construction costs direct overhead and allocated interest during the construction phase Indirect overhead costs are not included in the cost of self constructed assets Ore control drilling costs incurred during the production phase are allocated to inventory costs and then included in cost of sales Mining property assets typically have an estimated life equal to or greater than the estimated life of an ore reserves and are amortized over the life of the proven and probable reserves to which they relate using a units of production amortization method At open pit mines the costs of removing overburden from an ore body in order to expose ore during its initial development period are capitalized IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable An asset impairment is considered to exist if an asset s recoverable value is less than its carrying value as recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet In most cases an asset s recoverable value is assumed to be equal to the sum of the asset s expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows does not exceed the asset s carrying value an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows from the asset Future cash flows are based on estimated quantities of gold and other recoverable metals expected price of gold considering current and historical prices price trends and related factors production levels and cash costs of production capital and reclamation costs all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans In estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups All assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows The carrying amounts of purchase costs of exploration and development projects not yet in service are also evaluated periodically for impairment Numerous factors including but not limited to unexpected grade changes gold recovery problems shortages of equipment and consumables equipment failures and collapse of pit walls could impact our ability to achieve forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves Additionally commodity prices capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically Material changes to any of these factors or assumptions discussed above could result in future impairment charges to operations ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Environmental reclamation and closure liabilities are recognized at the time of environmental disturbance in amounts equal to the discounted value of expected future reclamation and closure costs The discounted cost of future reclamation and closure activities is capitalized and amortized over the life of the property The estimated future cash costs of such liabilities are based primarily upon environmental and regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions in which we operate Cash expenditures for environmental remediation and closure are charged as incurred against the accrual PROPERTY HOLDING COST Property holding costs are costs incurred to retain and maintain properties which have been written off but ownership is retained Such cost are expensed in the period incurred FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Our functional currency is the U S dollar The carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing when the assets were acquired or the liabilities assumed Revenue and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period Translation gains or losses are included in net earnings for the period Canadian currency in these financial statements is denoted as Cdn European Common Market currency is denoted as Euro or and Ghanaian currency is denoted as Ghana Cedi or Ghana Cedis INCOME TAXES Income taxes comprise the provision for or recovery of taxes actually paid or payable and for deferred taxes Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using enacted income tax rates in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of enactment The provision for or the recovery of deferred taxes is based on the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period In estimating deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in the multiple jurisdictions where our properties are located The amount of taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from our international tax audits We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in our various tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of additional taxes due We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our estimates of our tax liabilities If our estimate of tax liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater that the ultimate assessment a tax benefit is recognized A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authority based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefit of an uncertain tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount that is greater than likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority To the extent a full benefit is not expected to be realized an income tax liability is established Any change in judgment related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the year of such a change Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense in the current year MINING TAX Ghana imposed a levy on mining companies during and equal to of pre tax book income as reported in our financial accounting records This tax was considered a current mine operating tax and was expensed as incurred NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE Basic income loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing income available to Golden Star s common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period In periods with earnings the calculation of diluted net income per common share uses the treasury stock method to compute the dilutive effects of stock options and other dilutive instruments In periods of loss diluted net income per share is equal to basic income per share REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from the sale of metal is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists the price is determinable the metal has been delivered title and risk of ownership has passed to the buyer and collection is reasonably assured All of our gold is transported to a South African gold refiner who locates a buyer and arranges for sale of our gold on the same day that the gold is shipped from the mine site The sales price is based on the London P M fix on the day of shipment Title and risk of ownership pass to the buyer on the day doré is shipped from the mine sites STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Under the Company s stock option plan common share options may be granted to executives employees consultants and non employee directors Compensation expense for such grants is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase recorded in the Contributed Surplus account in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The expense is based on the fair values of the option at the time of grant and is recognized over the vesting periods of the respective options Consideration paid to the company on exercise of options is credited to share capital Under the Company s Deferred Share Unit DSU plan DSUs may be granted to executive officers and or directors Compensation expense for such grants is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase recorded in the Contributed Surplus account in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The expense is based on the fair values at the time of grant and is recognized over the vesting periods of the respective DSU Upon exercise the Company s compensation committee may at its discretion issue cash shares of a combination thereof LEASES Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the Company are recorded as capital leases and classified as property plant and equipment with a corresponding amount recorded with current and long term debt All other leases are classified as operating leases under which leasing costs are expensed in the period incurred FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Investments Equity security investments are accounted for as available for sale securities in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities Changes in the fair value of available for sale investments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income until the instrument is realized The Company periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its investments below the Company s carrying value are other than temporary in accordance with guidance for the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments The Company also monitors its investments for events or changes in circumstances that have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company s ability to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to determine if the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary Declines in fair value below the Company s carrying value deemed to be other than temporary are charged to the statement of operations Convertible debt The convertible senior unsecured debentures are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations Upfront costs and fees related to the convertible debt were recognized in the statement of operations as incurred and not deferred Derivatives At various times we utilize foreign exchange and commodity price derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gold prices respectively We do not employ derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or for speculative purposes Our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations at the end of each period in an account titled Derivative mark to market gain loss OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OCI Components of comprehensive income loss consist of unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities and net income Unrealized gains or losses on securities are net of any reclassification adjustments for realized gains or losses included in net income RECENTLY ADOPTED STANDARDS In January the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements which amends Subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements More specifically this update required a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers and b information about purchases sales issuances and settlements to be presented separately i e present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Level inputs This update clarified existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level and Level inputs We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of and it did not materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures In April the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No which amends topic Compensation Stock Compensation The amendment addresses the classification of an employee share based payment awards with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades stating that a share based award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity trades shall not be considered to contain a market performance or service condition Therefore such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity This new provision is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after December While our stock option plan denominates option strike prices in Canadian dollars a substantial portion of our common shares trade in Canada and thus this new guidance did not affect our consolidated financial position cash flows nor results of operations in RECENTLY ISSUED STANDARDS Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Comprehensive Income Topic Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements ASU eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity ASU is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal and should be applied retrospectively Our presentation of comprehensive income already complies with this new guidance Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements In May the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U S GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards Topic Fair Value Measurement ASU to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U S GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ASU changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements ASU is effective for us in and should be applied prospectively We do not believe adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING The following tables illustrate the classification of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the fair value hierarchy as of December The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are Level Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly and Level Inputs that are not based on observable market data Financial assets measured at fair value as at December Level Level Level Total Available for sale investments Warrants Financial liabilities measured at fair value as at December Level Level Level Total Convertible debentures Financial assets measured at fair value as at December Level Level Level Total Available for sale investments Warrants Financial liabilities measured at fair value as at December Level Level Level Total Convertible debentures The convertible senior unsecured debentures are recorded at fair value In prior years these debentures were valued based on discounted cash flows for the debt portion and based on a Black Scholes model for the equity portion As of December a quoted market price for the convertible senior unsecured debentures was available These debentures are listed as a Level liability as of December Fair value measurements using Level inputs Convertible debentures Balance at December Gain included in net income Transfer to level Balance at December DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES The derivative mark to market gains losses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are comprised of the following amounts For the years

Properties As part of the acquisition of the Dunkwa properties in we agreed to pay the seller a net smelter return royalty on future gold production from the Mansiso and Asikuma properties As per the

Ltd Hwini Butre s former owner an additional million in cash if at least one million ounces of gold are produced and recovered in the first five years of production from the area covered by the Hwini Butre prospecting license Gold production was initiated at Hwini Butre in May It is not possible at this time to know if future exploration work will increase Hwini Butre s reserves sufficiently to yield production of one million ounces prior to May EXPLORATION AGREEMENTS Obuom In October we entered into an agreement with AMI Resources Inc AMI which gives AMI the right to earn our ownership position in the Obuom property in Ghana Should AMI eventually obtain full rights to our position on the property and develop a gold mining operation at Obuom we would receive from AMI a net smelter

Ghanaian registered company filed suit in the Superior Court of Judicature the High Court of Justice Commercial Division in Accra Ghana against Golden Star Resources Ltd and our subsidiary St Jude Resources Ghana Ltd The plaintiff is challenging the validity of the concession contracts and settlements related to our acquisition of the Hwini Butre gold property in Ghana in More specifically the plaintiff is taking the position that the original sales agreement covered only a small section of the Hwini Butre concession and is now seeking million plus a royalty for the remaining portion of the concession The plaintiff is also seeking an interim court injunction which would halt mining on the concession until all legal issues are resolved In the plaintiff filed two similar suits in the United States challenging our ownership of the Hwini Butre concession and these claims were dismissed by the courts Based on the earlier dismissed claims brought by the same plaintiff and on comprehensive court approved settlements that were reached among the plaintiff and our wholly owned subsidiary St Jude Resources Ltd and other related parties before the Ghanaian Court of Appeal in February with respect to title to the Hwini Butre gold property we believe this present action as commenced before a lower court in the Ghana court hierarchy and within the same Ghanaian jurisdiction is without merit and will not be successful During the third quarter of we prepared a defense to this claim and filed it with the Ghana court on October and we continue to wait for the court s initial consideration of this case We have not accrued a provision for this action COST OF SALES For the years ended December Mining operations costs Operations costs from to metal inventory Mining related

United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP However a change in SEC position in late required Canadian companies such as Golden Star which do not qualify as foreign private issuers

company had a negative working capital position of million which includes cash of million and a current liability for our convertible debenture of million measured at fair value of million at December Our convertible debentures due on November became a current liability in the fourth quarter of which caused our current liabilities to exceed current assets The options available to settle this liability include cash re financing of the debt payment in common shares or a combination of shares and cash font div div style line height padding top px text align left font size pt font style font family inherit font size pt While it is our current intent to redeem the debentures with cash in November or depending upon market conditions refinance the debentures using long term debt the debentures contain a provision for settlement in common shares On maturity we may at our option satisfy the repayment obligation by paying the full million principal amount of the Debentures in cash or alternatively by issuing up to million common shares to the debenture holders If we opt to settle in shares we must redeem all and not less than all of the debentures by issuing up to million shares The value assigned to the shares issued will be determined as of the weighted average trading price of our common shares on the NYSE Amex stock exchange for the consecutive trading days ending five trading days preceding the maturity date If the value assigned to the shares multiplied by million shares is insufficient to cover the entire million liability we would be required to pay cash in addition to the shares issued in an amount that when added to the value of the shares will equal million If required the share issuance option would not impact our cash position to the extent shares

dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from our international tax audits We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in our various tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of additional taxes due We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our estimates of our tax liabilities If our estimate of tax liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater that the ultimate assessment a tax benefit is recognized font div div style line height padding top px text align left font size pt font style font family inherit font size pt A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authority based on the technical merits of the position The

XBRL DOCUMENT v Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Months Ended Dec Accounting Policies Abstract Significant Accounting Policies Text Block SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USE OF ESTIMATES Preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets liabilities deferred tax liabilities and expenses The more significant areas requiring the use of estimates include asset impairments valuation of convertible debentures stock based compensation depreciation and amortization of assets and site reclamation and closure accruals Accounting for these areas is subject to estimates and assumptions regarding among other things ore reserves gold recoveries future gold prices future operating costs asset usage rates and future mining activities Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances However actual results may differ from our estimates CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash includes cash deposits in any currency residing in checking accounts money market funds and sweep accounts Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months or less Investments with maturities greater than three months and up to one year are classified as short term investments while those with maturities in excess of one year are classified as long term investments Cash equivalents and short term investments are stated at cost which typically approximates market value INVENTORIES Inventory classifications include stockpiled ore in process inventory finished goods inventory and materials and supplies All of our inventories except materials and supplies are recorded at the lower of weighted average cost or market The stated value of all production inventories include direct production costs and attributable overhead and depreciation incurred to bring the materials to their current point in the processing cycle General and administrative costs for corporate offices are not included in any inventories Stockpiled ore represents coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is waiting processing Stockpiled ore is measured by estimating the number of tonnes via truck counts or by physical surveys added to or removed from the stockpile the number of contained ounces based on assay data and estimated gold recovery percentage Stockpiled ore value is based on the costs incurred including depreciation and amortization in bringing the ore to the stockpile Costs are added to the stockpiled ore based on current mining costs per tonne and are removed at the average cost per tonne of ore in the stockpile In process inventory represents material that is currently being treated in the processing plants to extract the contained gold and to transform it into a saleable product The amount of gold in the in process inventory is determined by assay and by measure of the quantities of the various gold bearing materials in the recovery process The in process gold is valued at the average of the beginning inventory and the cost of material fed into the processing stream plus in process conversion costs including applicable mine site overhead depreciation and amortization related to the processing facilities Finished goods inventory is composed of saleable gold in the form of doré bars that have been poured but not yet shipped from the mine site The bars are valued at the lower of total cost or net realizable value Included in the total costs are the direct costs of the mining and processing operations as well as direct mine site overhead amortization and depreciation Material and supply inventories consist mostly of equipment parts fuel lubricants and reagents consumed in the mining and ore processing activities Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value ORE RESERVE QUANTITIES USED IN UNITS OF PRODUCTION AMORTIZATION Gold ounces contained in stockpiled ore are excluded from total reserves when determining units of production amortization of mining property asset retirement assets and other assets PROPERTY ACQUISITION EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS The initial acquisition costs of exploration and mining properties are capitalized Subsequent exploration and development costs are expensed as incurred until such time as a feasibility study has been completed which establishes in compliance with SEC Industry Standard Guide that proven and probable reserves exist on the property After proven and probable reserves have been established subsequent exploration and development costs are capitalized until such time as a property is placed in service Following a property s in service date accumulated capitalized acquisition exploration and development costs are reclassified as Mining Property assets and are subject to amortization on a units of production basis when metal production begins PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property plant and equipment assets including machinery processing equipment mining equipment mine site facilities buildings vehicles and expenditures that extend the life of such assets are recorded at cost including acquisition and installation costs The costs of self constructed assets include direct construction costs direct overhead and allocated interest during the construction phase Indirect overhead costs are not included in the cost of self constructed assets Depreciation for mobile equipment and other assets having estimated lives shorter than the estimated life of the ore reserves is calculated using the straight line method at rates which depreciate the cost of the assets less their anticipated residual values if any over their estimated useful lives Mobile mining equipment is amortized over a five year life Assets such as processing plants power generators and buildings which have an estimated life equal to or greater than the estimated life of the ore reserves are amortized over the life of the proven and probable reserves of the associated mining property using a units of production amortization method The net book value of property plant and equipment assets is charged against income if the mine site is abandoned and it is determined that the assets cannot be economically transferred to another project or sold MINING PROPERTIES Mining property assets including property acquisition costs tailings dams mine site drilling costs where proven and probable reserves have been established pre production waste stripping condemnation drilling roads feasibility studies and wells are recorded at cost The costs of self constructed assets include direct construction costs direct overhead and allocated interest during the construction phase Indirect overhead costs are not included in the cost of self constructed assets Ore control drilling costs incurred during the production phase are allocated to inventory costs and then included in cost of sales Mining property assets typically have an estimated life equal to or greater than the estimated life of an ore reserves and are amortized over the life of the proven and probable reserves to which they relate using a units of production amortization method At open pit mines the costs of removing overburden from an ore body in order to expose ore during its initial development period are capitalized IMPAIRMENT OF LONG LIVED ASSETS We review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable An asset impairment is considered to exist if an asset s recoverable value is less than its carrying value as recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet In most cases an asset s recoverable value is assumed to be equal to the sum of the asset s expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis If the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows does not exceed the asset s carrying value an impairment loss is measured and recorded based on discounted estimated future cash flows from the asset Future cash flows are based on estimated quantities of gold and other recoverable metals expected price of gold considering current and historical prices price trends and related factors production levels and cash costs of production capital and reclamation costs all based on detailed engineering life of mine plans In estimating future cash flows assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of future cash flows from other asset groups All assets at a particular operation are considered together for purposes of estimating future cash flows The carrying amounts of purchase costs of exploration and development projects not yet in service are also evaluated periodically for impairment Numerous factors including but not limited to unexpected grade changes gold recovery problems shortages of equipment and consumables equipment failures and collapse of pit walls could impact our ability to achieve forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves Additionally commodity prices capital expenditure requirements and reclamation costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to assess impairment The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves have been identified due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically Material changes to any of these factors or assumptions discussed above could result in future impairment charges to operations ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Environmental reclamation and closure liabilities are recognized at the time of environmental disturbance in amounts equal to the discounted value of expected future reclamation and closure costs The discounted cost of future reclamation and closure activities is capitalized and amortized over the life of the property The estimated future cash costs of such liabilities are based primarily upon environmental and regulatory requirements of the various jurisdictions in which we operate Cash expenditures for environmental remediation and closure are charged as incurred against the accrual PROPERTY HOLDING COST Property holding costs are costs incurred to retain and maintain properties which have been written off but ownership is retained Such cost are expensed in the period incurred FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Our functional currency is the U S dollar The carrying value of monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date Non monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing when the assets were acquired or the liabilities assumed Revenue and expense items are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period Translation gains or losses are included in net earnings for the period Canadian currency in these financial statements is denoted as Cdn European Common Market currency is denoted as Euro or and Ghanaian currency is denoted as Ghana Cedi or Ghana Cedis INCOME TAXES Income taxes comprise the provision for or recovery of taxes actually paid or payable and for deferred taxes Deferred income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed using enacted income tax rates in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of enactment The provision for or the recovery of deferred taxes is based on the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period In estimating deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in the multiple jurisdictions where our properties are located The amount of taxes paid are dependent upon many factors including negotiations with taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from our international tax audits We recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in our various tax jurisdictions based on our assessment of additional taxes due We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances however due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our estimates of our tax liabilities If our estimate of tax liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be greater that the ultimate assessment a tax benefit is recognized A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may only be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authority based on the technical merits of the position The tax benefit of an uncertain tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount that is greater than likely to be realized upon settlement with the tax authority To the extent a full benefit is not expected to be realized an income tax liability is established Any change in judgment related to the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the year of such a change Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense in the current year MINING TAX Ghana imposed a levy on mining companies during and equal to of pre tax book income as reported in our financial accounting records This tax was considered a current mine operating tax and was expensed as incurred NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE Basic income loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing income available to Golden Star s common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period In periods with earnings the calculation of diluted net income per common share uses the treasury stock method to compute the dilutive effects of stock options and other dilutive instruments In periods of loss diluted net income per share is equal to basic income per share REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue from the sale of metal is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists the price is determinable the metal has been delivered title and risk of ownership has passed to the buyer and collection is reasonably assured All of our gold is transported to a South African gold refiner who locates a buyer and arranges for sale of our gold on the same day that the gold is shipped from the mine site The sales price is based on the London P M fix on the day of shipment Title and risk of ownership pass to the buyer on the day doré is shipped from the mine sites STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Under the Company s stock option plan common share options may be granted to executives employees consultants and non employee directors Compensation expense for such grants is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase recorded in the Contributed Surplus account in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The expense is based on the fair values of the option at the time of grant and is recognized over the vesting periods of the respective options Consideration paid to the company on exercise of options is credited to share capital Under the Company s Deferred Share Unit DSU plan DSUs may be granted to executive officers and or directors Compensation expense for such grants is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of general and administrative expense with a corresponding increase recorded in the Contributed Surplus account in the Consolidated Balance Sheets The expense is based on the fair values at the time of grant and is recognized over the vesting periods of the respective DSU Upon exercise the Company s compensation committee may at its discretion issue cash shares of a combination thereof LEASES Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the Company are recorded as capital leases and classified as property plant and equipment with a corresponding amount recorded with current and long term debt All other leases are classified as operating leases under which leasing costs are expensed in the period incurred FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Investments Equity security investments are accounted for as available for sale securities in accordance with ASC guidance on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities Changes in the fair value of available for sale investments are charged or credited to other comprehensive income until the instrument is realized The Company periodically evaluates whether declines in fair values of its investments below the Company s carrying value are other than temporary in accordance with guidance for the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments The Company also monitors its investments for events or changes in circumstances that have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment and evaluates qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company s ability to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs to determine if the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary Declines in fair value below the Company s carrying value deemed to be other than temporary are charged to the statement of operations Convertible debt The convertible senior unsecured debentures are recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC Changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations Upfront costs and fees related to the convertible debt were recognized in the statement of operations as incurred and not deferred Derivatives At various times we utilize foreign exchange and commodity price derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and gold prices respectively We do not employ derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or for speculative purposes Our derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of operations at the end of each period in an account titled Derivative mark to market gain loss OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OCI Components of comprehensive income loss consist of unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities and net income Unrealized gains or losses on securities are net of any reclassification adjustments for realized gains or losses included in net income RECENTLY ADOPTED STANDARDS In January the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements which amends Subtopic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to require new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosure requirements More specifically this update required a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers and b information about purchases sales issuances and settlements to be presented separately i e present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs Level inputs This update clarified existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using Level and Level inputs We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of and it did not materially expand our consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures In April the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No which amends topic Compensation Stock Compensation The amendment addresses the classification of an employee share based payment awards with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades stating that a share based award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity trades shall not be considered to contain a market performance or service condition Therefore such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity This new provision is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after December While our stock option plan denominates option strike prices in Canadian dollars a substantial portion of our common shares trade in Canada and thus this new guidance did not affect our consolidated financial position cash flows nor results of operations in RECENTLY ISSUED STANDARDS Presentation of Comprehensive Income In June the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Comprehensive Income Topic Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements ASU eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity ASU is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal and should be applied retrospectively Our presentation of comprehensive income already complies with this new guidance Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements In May the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U S GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards Topic Fair Value Measurement ASU to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between U S GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ASU changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements ASU is effective for us in and should be applied prospectively We do not believe adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements X Details Name us

It also includes other kinds of accounts that have the general characteristics of demand deposits in that the Entity may deposit additional funds at any time and also effectively may withdraw funds at any time without prior notice or penalty Cash equivalents excluding items classified as marketable securities include short term highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less qualify under that definition Original maturity means original maturity to the entity holding the investment For example both a three month US Treasury bill and a three year Treasury note purchased three months from maturity qualify as cash equivalents However a Treasury note purchased three years ago does not become a cash equivalent when its remaining maturity is three months Compensating balance arrangements that do not legally restrict the withdrawal or usage of cash amounts may be reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents while legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against borrowing arrangements contracts entered into with others or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits are not generally reported as cash and cash equivalents Includes cash and cash equivalents associated with the entity s continuing operations Excludes cash and cash equivalents associated with the disposal group and discontinued operation

Contingencies COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Our commitments and contingencies include the following items ENVIRONMENTAL BONDING IN GHANA In July we increased a letter of credit for Wassa HBB s environmental bonding from million to million This brought the total bonded amount including million of cash from million to million In early Ghana Environmental Protection Agency EPA raised Wassa HBB s reclamation bonding requirement to approximately million reflecting increases in on going mining disturbances We expect that this million increase in bonding will be met with a combination of letters of credit and cash We have also bonded million to cover rehabilitation and closure obligations at Bogoso Prestea These bonding requirements have been met by an million letter of credit from a commercial bank and a million cash deposit held by the EPA The cash deposits are recorded as Restricted Cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets In Bogoso Prestea resubmitted an updated draft of the Environmental Management Plan EMP to the EPA that included an updated estimate of the reclamation and closure costs prepared by a third party consultant A consultant was commissioned to prepare the reclamation and closure cost estimate and the final EMP was submitted to the EPA in February Bogoso Prestea has completed all the legal requirements and is waiting for the environmental certificate In the mean time and in compliance with the legal time line for the previous EMP Bogoso Prestea prepared a new EMP and submitted it to the EPA in the fourth quarter of This EMP included a more current estimate of the reclamation and closure costs for Bogoso Prestea and could result in a need for additional bonding later in In March we provided million of reclamation bonding to the EPA to cover backfilling of the Plant North pit at Prestea which we mined from to The bonding requirements were met by a million cash deposit and a million letter of credit from a commercial bank Provisions of the bond allow the bonded amount to be reduced as cash is spent on the progress of the backfill project The bonded amount was reduced by million in June and then a further million in August reflecting the effort and success achieved in backfilling the Plant North Pit In November the million cash deposit was refunded to us upon completion of the backfilling project and the bonding requirements expired at that time GOVERNMENT OF GHANA S RIGHTS TO INCREASE ITS PARTICIPATION Under Act the Government of Ghana has the right to acquire a special share or golden share in our Ghanaian subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the Government of Ghana and such subsidiaries might agree and a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries A golden share carries no voting rights and does not participate in dividends profits or assets To date the Government of Ghana has not sought to exercise any of these rights at our properties ROYALTIES Dunkwa Properties As part of the acquisition of the Dunkwa properties in we agreed to pay the seller a net smelter return royalty on future gold production from the Mansiso and Asikuma properties As per the acquisition agreement there will be no royalty due on the first ounces produced from Mampon which is located on the Asikuma property The amount of the royalty is based on a sliding scale which ranges from of net smelter return at gold prices at or below per ounce and progressively increases to for gold prices in excess of per ounce Government of Ghana The Ghana Government receives a royalty equal to of mineral revenues effective as of March Prior to March the royalty rate was of mineral revenues Benso Benso has paid a per ounce gold production royalty to former owners but with mining ending at Benso in February there will be no further royalty payments after this time Hwini Butre As part of the agreement for the purchase of the Hwini Butre properties Golden Star agreed to pay B D Goldfields Ltd Hwini Butre s former owner an additional million in cash if at least one million ounces of gold are produced and recovered in the first five years of production from the area covered by the Hwini Butre prospecting license Gold production was initiated at Hwini Butre in May It is not possible at this time to know if future exploration work will increase Hwini Butre s reserves sufficiently to yield production of one million ounces prior to May EXPLORATION AGREEMENTS Obuom In October we entered into an agreement with AMI Resources Inc AMI which gives AMI the right to earn our ownership position in the Obuom property in Ghana Should AMI eventually obtain full rights to our position on the property and develop a gold mining operation at Obuom we would receive from AMI a net smelter return royalty on of the property s gold production Goulagou and Rounga In October we entered into an option agreement with Riverstone Resources Inc Riverstone whereby Riverstone had the right to acquire our interest in the Goulagou and Rounga properties in Burkina Faso To exercise the option Riverstone was required to spend Cdn million on exploration programs on the Goulagou and Rounga properties over a four year period ended in February and could then purchase our interest for million in cash and Riverstone common shares We were also entitled to receive up to two million shares of Riverstone over the term of the option all of which were received as of March In addition we received a one time distribution of two million Riverstone common share purchase warrants during The Riverstone purchase warrants had an exercise price of Cdn and were exercised in January In December Riverstone notified us of their intent to exercise their option to acquire Goulagou and Rounga in February The sale of exploration projects was completed in February upon receipt of million of cash and million Riverstone common shares LEGAL PROCEEDINGS On July B D Goldfields Ltd plaintiff a Ghanaian registered company filed suit in the Superior Court of Judicature the High Court of Justice Commercial Division in Accra Ghana against Golden Star Resources Ltd and our subsidiary St Jude Resources Ghana Ltd The plaintiff is challenging the validity of the concession contracts and settlements related to our acquisition of the Hwini Butre gold property in Ghana in More specifically the plaintiff is taking the position that the original sales agreement covered only a small section of the Hwini Butre concession and is now seeking million plus a royalty for the remaining portion of the concession The plaintiff is also seeking an interim court injunction which would halt mining on the concession until all legal issues are resolved In the plaintiff filed two similar suits in the United States challenging our ownership of the Hwini Butre concession and these claims were dismissed by the courts Based on the earlier dismissed claims brought by the same plaintiff and on comprehensive court approved settlements that were reached among the plaintiff and our wholly owned subsidiary St Jude Resources Ltd and other related parties before the Ghanaian Court of Appeal in February with respect to title to the Hwini Butre gold property we believe this present action as commenced before a lower court in the Ghana court hierarchy and within the same Ghanaian jurisdiction is without merit and will not be successful During the third quarter of we prepared a defense to this claim and filed it with the Ghana court on October and we continue to wait for the court s initial consideration of this case We have not accrued a provision for this action X Details Name us gaap_CommitmentsAndContingenciesDisclosureAbstract Namespace

shipped in the current and previous fiscal year The shipped and installed PASSUR Systems are capitalized as part of the Company owned PASSUR Network The Company will continue to expand the PASSUR Network by shipping and installing additional PASSUR Systems throughout fiscal year Management anticipates that future PASSUR sites will provide increased coverage for the PASSUR Network by increasing the Company s ability to contract with new customers at such locations and by providing existing customers with additional data solutions The Company will continue to market the business intelligence predictive analytics as well as decision support applications and solutions derived from the PASSUR Network directly to the aviation industry and organizations that serve or are served by the aviation industry There were one hundred and fifty five Company owned PASSUR Systems located at airports worldwide at the end of fiscal year Redundant PASSUR Systems have been installed at major customer locations Management concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence predictive analytics and decision support product applications utilizing data primarily derived from the PASSUR Network Such efforts include the continued development of new products professional services and existing product enhancements Page Revenues increased by or to in fiscal year from in fiscal year New customer subscriptions and existing customer upgrades to the Company s suite of software applications and new customer engagements for professional services accounted for and of this increase respectively The Company continues to develop and deploy new software applications and solutions as well as a wide selection of products which address customers needs easily delivered through web based applications as well as other new products which include stand alone professional services Cost of Revenues Costs associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor depreciation of PASSUR Network Systems amortization of capitalized software development costs communication costs data feeds allocated overhead costs travel and entertainment and consulting fees Also included in cost of revenues are costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR Network Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR Network Systems Additionally cost of revenues in each reporting period is impacted by the number of PASSUR Network units added to the Network which include the production shipment and installation of these assets which are capitalized to the PASSUR Network and capitalized costs associated with software development projects Both of these are referred to as Capitalized Assets and are depreciated and or amortized over their respective useful lives and charged to cost of revenues Cost of revenues increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to increases in payroll and related costs of depreciation and amortization of as well as an increase in communication costs When the Company ships and installs its PASSUR Network Systems there is a reduction in cost of revenues due to the fact that the labor related costs for these systems are capitalized rather than expensed as a component of costs of revenue Fewer systems were shipped and installed in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year which resulted in an increase in cost of revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year This increase in cost of revenues was partially offset by an increase of in the capitalization of software development costs as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the Company s increased investment in software development projects in the current fiscal year Research and development expenses increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to the Company s investment in research and development in a substantial software product These increases consisted primarily of payroll and related costs The Company s research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company s existing hardware software and information products The Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in research and development to develop maintain and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers There were no customer sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years or Research and development expenses are funded by current operations Selling general and administrative expenses increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs Revenues increased by or to total costs and expenses increased by or to and income from operations increased by or to in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year Page Interest Expense Related Party Interest expense related party decreased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the fact that on May the Company entered into a transaction that reduced its outstanding notes payable to G S Beckwith Gilbert the Company s significant shareholder and Chairman by as a result of the transaction described in Private Placement below On September the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement reducing the annual interest rate from to an annual rate of payable in cash and the Company s option to pay the remaining interest of per annum

of current state and local minimum taxes At October the Company had available a federal net operating loss carry forward of for income tax purposes which will expire in various tax years from through The Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required each reporting period A valuation allowance is established if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized During the Company reversed of a total valuation allowance of related to deferred tax assets since it was determined that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized This determination was primarily based on cumulative positive earnings in recent years and projected taxable income in the future In evaluating whether or not to realize a deferred tax asset the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results and a forecast of future taxable income The Company had net income of or per diluted share in fiscal year as compared to net income of or per diluted share in fiscal year Impact of Inflation In the opinion of

had net income of for fiscal year Management is addressing the Company s working capital deficiency by aggressively marketing the Company s PASSUR Network Systems information capabilities in its existing product and professional service lines as well as in new products and professional services which are continually being developed and deployed Management believes that expanding its existing suite of software products and professional services which address the wide array of needs of the aviation industry through the continued development of new product and service offerings will continue to lead to increased growth in the Company s customer base and subscription based revenues Additionally if the Company s business plan does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the Company s operating cash requirements the Company will attempt to obtain external financing and if such external financing is not obtained the Company has received an unconditional and irrevocable commitment from its significant shareholder and Chairman to receive the necessary continuing financial support to meet such obligations through January Page Effective November the Company entered into

by the Company prior to the extended due date During fiscal year Mr Gilbert loaned the Company an additional bringing the principal amount of the notes payable due to Mr Gilbert to on October In fiscal year Mr Gilbert loaned the Company an additional which was used in part to fund the prior fiscal year s interest payment thereby increasing the principal balance of the notes payable to During fiscal year the Company paid fiscal year interest to Mr Gilbert of representing the entire cash portion of the fiscal year interest due thereby meeting the cash payment requirements of the loan agreement Total cash payments for interest made to Mr Gilbert in fiscal year were including the remaining fiscal year interest payment The balance of the fiscal year interest payable of was accrued In

for interest made to Mr Gilbert in fiscal year were including the remaining fiscal year interest payment The Company has received a commitment from Mr Gilbert dated January that if the Company at any time is unable to meet its obligations through January Mr Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations Such commitment for financial support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company in addition to the deferral of principal and or interest payments due on the existing loans if deemed necessary The note payable is secured by the Company s assets The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet operating and investment requirements through October During such period the Company does not anticipate borrowing additional funds from Mr Gilbert although it has received a commitment from Mr Gilbert to do so if the Company requires additional funds Net cash provided by operating activities was for fiscal year and consisted of non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization of and stock based compensation expense offset by a deferred tax allowance reversal of as well as of net income and a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of customer invoicing This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of of accrued interest related party as well as decreases in deferred revenue and accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor invoice payments Net cash used in investing activities was for fiscal year expended primarily for capitalized software development costs Net cash used in financing activities was for fiscal year and consisted of repayments of notes payable related party and private placement expenditures offset by proceeds from stock issuance and proceeds from the exercise of stock options Page The Company s revenue has increased as a result of its subscription based revenue model The Company is actively addressing the increasing costs associated with supporting the business and plans to identify and reduce any unnecessary costs as part of its cost reduction initiatives Additionally the aviation market has been impacted by budgetary constraints airline bankruptcies and consolidations due to the downturn in the current economy the terrorist events of September the continued war on terrorism and changes in fuel costs The aviation market is extensively regulated by government agencies particularly the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board and management anticipates that new regulations relating to air travel may continue to be issued Substantially all of the Company s revenues are derived from airports airlines and organizations that serve or are served by the aviation industry Any new regulations or changes in the economic situation of the aviation industry could have an impact on the future operations of the Company either positively or negatively Interest by potential customers in the information and decision support software products obtained from PASSUR Network Systems and its professional services remains strong As a result the Company anticipates an increase in future revenues However the Company cannot predict if such revenues will materialize If sales do not increase losses may occur The extent of such profits or losses will be dependent on sales volume achieved and Company cost reduction initiatives Private Placement On May the Company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell shares of the Company s common stock subject to trading restrictions in a private placement financing with a select group of accredited investors including certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company shares of restricted common stock were sold to non affiliated investors at a price of per share and shares of restricted common stock were sold to three of the Company s Directors at a price of per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of In addition on the same day the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Mr Gilbert pursuant to which the Company repaid from the private placement proceeds of principal on the outstanding notes payable to Mr Gilbert and converted of the principal amount of the notes payable held by Mr Gilbert into shares of common stock subject to trading restrictions A new note payable was issued to Mr Gilbert equal to the remaining principal balance of the existing notes payable following such conversion The stock issued by the Company to Mr Gilbert was done so based on the trading price of the Company s stock and thus considered to be fair value based on a Level input per ASC Topic Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and accordingly no gain or loss resulted from the conversion The new note payable bears a maturity date of November and an annual interest rate of payable as follows interest at the annual rate of will be payable in cash and the remaining interest of per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or paid in kind and added to the principal of the note payable Interest payments will be made annually on October of each year On September the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement reducing the annual interest rate from to an annual rate of payable in cash and the Company s option to pay the remaining interest of per annum in cash or paid in kind was discontinued Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Page Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB SAB requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured The Company also recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC SOP Software Revenue Recognition as amended when applicable The Company s revenues are generated by selling subscription based real time decision and solutions information as well as software products professional services and annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR Radar Systems Revenues generated from subscription and maintenance agreements are recognized over the term of such executed agreements and or customer s receipt of such data or services In accordance with ASC we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products or performance of maintenance when all of the following criteria are met we have evidence of an agreement with a customer we deliver the products services license or maintenance agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that the sale may not be complete and or final and collection is probable The Company records revenues pursuant to individual contracts on a month by month basis as outlined by the applicable agreement In many cases the Company may invoice respective customers in advance of the specified period either quarterly or annually which coincides with the terms of the agreement In such cases the Company will defer at the close of each month and or reporting period any subscription or maintenance revenues invoiced for which services have yet to be rendered in accordance with ASC Our software licenses usually do not include acceptance provisions An acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to a binding agreement to license the software If a subscription agreement includes an acceptance provision the Company will not recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or if not notified by the customer to cancel the subscription agreement the expiration of the acceptance period From time to time the Company will receive one time payments from customers for rights including but not limited to the rights to use certain data at an agreed upon location s for a specific use and or for an unlimited number of users Such one time payments are in the form of license fees These fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement or expected useful life of such license arrangement whichever is longer but typically five years Deferred revenue is classified on the Company s balance sheet as a liability until such time as revenue from services is properly recognized as revenue in accordance with SAB and or ASC and the corresponding agreement Capitalized Software Development Costs The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Capitalized software development costs are comprised of costs incurred to develop and significantly enhance software products to be sold or otherwise marketed When technological feasibility is established the Company begins to capitalize development costs and once the software product is available for general release to the public the Company begins to amortize such costs to cost of revenues The Company s policy on capitalized software costs determines whether the costs incurred are classified as capitalized costs in accordance with ASC or as research and development expenses In cases where the Company capitalizes costs incurred with development of new hardware software products a product specification is developed as the guideline for the capitalization of costs associated with such project in accordance with ASC Once a product has been made available for sale and or released for sale to the general public the development costs of that product are no longer capitalized and amortization is provided on a product by product basis based on the greater of the ratio of current gross revenues to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning at the point the product becomes available for general release typically over five years Costs incurred to maintain or support such product are expensed as incurred In some cases the Company may capitalize costs incurred in the development of enhanced versions of already existing products but will immediately expense any additional costs incurred to maintain products which were completed and released to the general public in accordance with ASC Determining and evaluating whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization requires the exercise of judgment by management Page The Company s net capitalized software costs totaled at October The carrying value of capitalized software costs are evaluated for impairment based on the forecasted and actual future cash flows expected to be generated from such assets as determined and evaluated by management Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Impairment is recognized to the extent the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell The Company evaluates the periods of amortization continually in determining whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives If estimates are changed the unamortized costs will be allocated to the increased or decreased number of remaining periods in the revised life The Company s long lived assets which include the PASSUR Network and property plant and equipment totaled and accounted for of the Company s total assets as of October At each reporting period management evaluates the carrying values of the Company s assets The evaluation considers the undiscounted cash flows generated from current contractual revenue sources and the anticipated forecast revenue derived from each asset The Company then evaluates these revenues on an overall basis to determine if any impairment issues exist As of October based upon management s evaluation of the above asset groups no impairment of these asset groups exist If these forecasts are not met the Company may have to record impairment charges not previously recorded Depreciation and Amortization The net PASSUR Network net capitalized software development costs and net property plant and equipment totaled and respectively at October Total depreciation and amortization expense related to these capitalized assets was in fiscal year In management s judgment the estimated depreciable lives used to calculate the annual depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows PASSUR Network years Capitalized software development costs years Property plant and equipment to years The PASSUR Network includes PASSUR Systems and the related software workstations used for the data derived from PASSUR Systems as well as costs pertaining to raw material work in process and finished goods components PASSUR Network installations include the direct and indirect production and installation costs incurred for each of the Company owned PASSUR Systems PASSUR Network Systems which are not installed in the PASSUR Network are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded Once installed the PASSUR Systems are depreciated over seven years All of the Company s capitalized assets are recorded at cost which may also include salaries and related overhead costs incurred during production and or development and depreciated and or amortized over the asset s estimated useful life for financial statement purposes The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and industry standards for similar assets Circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments see Impairment of Long Lived Assets above are identified and prospective depreciation or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly Page Total depreciation and amortization expense was in fiscal year and consisted of and for the PASSUR Network capitalized software development costs and property plant and equipment respectively Stock Based Compensation The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS R Share Based Payments which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest The fair value of stock options was determined using the Black Scholes valuation model Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period net of forfeitures Stock based compensation expense was and in fiscal years and respectively and was primarily included in selling general and administrative expenses Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income Specifically the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance We do not expect that the adoption of this disclosure only guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial results and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal In May the FASB issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements This guidance amends United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS The amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in U S GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements This includes clarification of the Board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements In addition to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that U S GAAP and IFRS fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way for example using the word shall rather than should to describe the requirements in U S GAAP This amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on results of operations or financial position ]]></c>

the resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flow Regardless of the outcome litigation can have an adverse impact on ESW because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors In addition it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such

upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States US GAAP A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of ESW s financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on ESW s financial condition and results of operations Specifically critical accounting estimates generally require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and if different estimates or judgments were used the use of these estimates or judgments would have a material effect on ESW s financial condition or results of operations The estimates and judgments ESW makes that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses are based on historical experience and on various other factors which ESW believes to be reasonable in the circumstances under which they are made Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions ESW considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition the valuation of inventories research and development and accounting for the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to be critical accounting policies The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note to the Financial Statements of this K report ESW is exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates The Company has foreign currency exposures at its foreign operations related to buying and selling currencies other than the local currencies The risk under these interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreement

subsidiaries to U S dollars during consolidation These risks have been significantly mitigated by the move of ESW s manufacturing operations to PA USA During the year the Company changed the functional currency of its Canadian operations from the Canadian dollar to the U S dollar see Note Prior to this change ESW recognized a translation loss of in as compared to a gain of in reported as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity deficit Following the change in accounting policy ESW recognized a translation loss of which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss Also included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December ESW has recognized a translation loss of as compared to a loss of in primarily as a result of exchange rate differences between the U S dollar and the Canadian dollar INTEREST RATE RISK ESW currently has no variable rate long term debt that exposes ESW to interest rate risk ]]></c>

are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related items affect an entity s financial position operations and cash flows This guidance was effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after November The Company adopted this guidance on January Accounting For Natural Gas and Oil Producing Activities We use the full cost method to account for our natural gas and oil producing activities Under this accounting method we capitalize substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition development and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves in full cost pools maintained by geographic areas regardless of whether reserves are actually discovered and apply a quarterly full cost ceiling test Adverse changes in conditions primarily gas price declines could result in permanent write downs in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as well as non cash charges to operations but would not affect cash flows Property Equipment and Depreciation We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the acquisition of methane petroleum and natural gas interests are capitalized Under this method all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs annual carrying charges of non producing properties geological and geophysical costs costs of drilling and equipping productive and non productive wells and direct exploration salaries and related benefits Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas properties are recorded as a reduction of the related capitalized costs without recognition of a gain or loss unless the disposal would result in a change of percent or more in the depletion rate Depreciation and depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based upon estimates of proved reserves as determined by independent consultants with oil and gas being converted to a common unit of measure based on their relative energy content The costs of acquisition and exploration of unproved oil and gas properties including any related capitalized interest expense are not subject to depletion but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage are also not subject to depletion Costs not subject to depletion are periodically assessed for possible impairment or reductions in value If a reduction in value has occurred costs subject to depletion are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those operations where a reserve base is not yet established Estimated future removal and site restoration costs are provided over the life of proven reserves on units of production basis Costs which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation are estimated each period by management based on current regulations actual expenses incurred and technology and industry standards The charge is included in the provision for depletion and depreciation and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred We apply a ceiling test to capitalized costs which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value using a ten percent discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from production of proven reserves at year end at market prices less future production administrative financing site restoration and income tax costs plus the lower of cost or estimated market value of unproved properties If capitalized costs are determined to exceed estimated future net revenues a write down of carrying value is charged to depletion in the period N A ]]></c>

to water usage from higher occupancy most of which is a recoverable expense Table of Contents Property management expenses Property management expenses consist of regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations These expenses were million for the year ended December compared to million for the same period in The increase was primarily attributable to general overhead expenses resulting from the consolidation acquisition of assets since The increase in expenses was partially offset by a million annual expense adjustment of self insurance reserves which is based on an actuarial study of claims history General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses were million for the year ended December compared to million for the same period

this Form K for additional details Interest expense Interest expense was million for the year ended December compared to million for the same period in The million decrease is primarily attributable to a lower weighted average interest rate on our total consolidated debt when compared to the prior year period partially resulting from our repurchase of unsecured senior notes of CRLP having

Liquidity and Capital Resources As noted above except as otherwise required by the context references to the Company we us and our refer to the Trust and CRLP together as well as CRLP s subsidiaries Unless otherwise specified below the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources applies to both the Trust and CRLP Short Term Liquidity Needs We believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items capital expenditures incurred to lease our multifamily apartment communities and commercial space e g tenant improvements and leasing commissions interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt and quarterly distributions that we pay to the Trust s shareholders and holders of partnership units in CRLP With million of debt maturing in including amounts outstanding under our unsecured Credit Facility as of December and million of our pro rata share of unconsolidated debt we believe that cash generated from operations dispositions of assets and additional borrowings will be sufficient to allow us to execute our previously discussed business directives and meet our short term liquidity requirements However factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our future cash flow We currently expect to refinance our existing unsecured credit facility or enter into a new credit facility prior to its maturity on June However there can be no assurance that we will be successful in refinancing or replacing our credit facility or that the financial terms or covenants of any refinanced or new facility will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing credit facility See Item A in our Form K Risk Factors Risks Associated with Our Indebtedness and Financing Activities We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control which may affect our ability to pursue strategic opportunities satisfy our debt obligations and make distributions to our shareholders Our cash flows from operations financing activities and investing activities including dispositions as well as general economic and market conditions are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources Changes in cash due to operating investing and financing activities are as follows Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to million for the year ended December from million for the comparable prior year period The change was primarily driven by an increase in operating performance at our same property multifamily apartment communities gains recognized on the disposition of assets and the timing of property tax payments relating to accrued expenses This increase was partially offset by million of tax refunds received during the year ended December For we expect cash flows from operating activities to be higher than in due to acquisitions and developments placed into service in Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended December compared to million for the comparable prior year period The change is primarily the result of increased acquisition activity in partially offset by proceeds from dispositions and a reduction in capital expenditures in when compared to the same period in the prior year As we continue to explore growth through potential acquisitions and developments we expect our cash flow used in investing activities to increase in compared to Financing activities Net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended December compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the comparable prior year period In we issued a new senior unsecured term loan of million which was offset by payments on outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and used million of funds to repurchase the remaining outstanding Series B Preferred Units Table of Contents of CRLP In addition in we had a decrease in cash used for unsecured senior note maturity payments repurchases when compared to In we used million of funds to redeem the Series D Preferred Depositary Shares and million of funds to repurchase of CRLP s outstanding Series B Preferred Units and received new secured financings of million The majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases primarily at our multifamily apartment communities Therefore our operating cash flow is dependent upon i the number of multifamily apartment communities in our portfolio ii rental rates iii occupancy rates iv operating expenses associated with these apartment communities and v the ability of residents to make their rental payments Weakness in the economy and job market in the U S since had adversely affected rents we are able to charge and thereby adversely affected our operating cash flows However in the last half of and in revenues from our same property multifamily communities were positive when compared to the same periods in prior years We are continuing to see some improvements in the multifamily fundamentals such as higher occupancy rates positive new and renewal lease rates over the expiring leases a declining homeownership rate and a decline in turnover which all are positive developments for the multifamily industry We have made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections through of the Internal Revenue Code of as amended the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December If we maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our distributed net income if we distribute at least of our REIT taxable income to the Trust s shareholders Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income Long Term Liquidity Needs We believe our principal long term liquidity needs are to fund the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures significant capital expenditures that need to be made at our properties development projects that we undertake and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue Historically we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at the time which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings by CRLP through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of collateralized and unsecured debt sales of common shares of the Trust including through at the market equity offering programs sales of preferred shares of the Trust capital raised through the disposition of assets and joint venture capital transactions On May the Trust and CRLP filed a joint universal shelf registration statement with the SEC allowing the Trust to offer from time to time an unspecified amount of equity securities of the Trust including common and preferred shares and allowing CRLP to offer from time to time an unspecified amount of debt securities each on an as needed basis subject to the ability of the Trust and CRLP to effect offerings on satisfactory terms based on prevailing conditions In the Trust sold common shares under its December and May continuous at the market equity offering programs at a weighted average issuance price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million Pursuant to CRLP s Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership each time the Trust issues common shares pursuant to the foregoing programs or other equity offerings CRLP issues to the Trust its general partner an equal number of units for the same price at which the common shares were sold and the Trust contributes the net proceeds of such offerings to CRLP The net proceeds resulting from these two offering programs were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility to partially fund the acquisition of three multifamily properties and to fund other general corporate purposes see Note to the Trust s and CRLP s Consolidated Financial Statements Real Estate Activity Acquisition Activity The December at the market equity offering program was fully exhausted in April and the May at the market equity offering program was fully exhausted in July Our ability to raise funds through sales of common shares and preferred shares of the Trust and debt securities of CRLP in the future is dependent on among other things general market conditions for REIT s market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of the Trust s common shares We will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time but the equity and credit markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive or at all Our ability to incur additional debt and the cost of incurring additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors including our credit ratings the value of our assets our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders We will continue to monitor the unsecured and secured debt markets and as market conditions permit access Table of Contents borrowings that are advantageous to us Our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to REITs We may not be able to sell a property or properties as quickly as we have in the past or on terms as favorable as we have previously received During the year ended December we sold assets or our interests in assets for aggregate proceeds of approximately million million from the sale of consolidated assets including land parcels and for sale residential assets and million which is our pro rata share from the sale of unconsolidated assets and from dispositions of our joint venture interests in the underlying assets The proceeds from these asset sales were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our credit facility At December our total outstanding debt balance was billion The outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion or of the total debt balance and floating rate debt of million or of the total debt balance As further discussed below at December we had an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for total borrowings of up to million and a cash management line providing for borrowings up to million both of which mature on June Senior Unsecured Term Loan On July CRLP with the Trust as guarantor entered into a term loan agreement the Term Loan Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank National Association Wells Fargo as administrative agent and a lender and certain other financial institutions party thereto as lenders which provides for a million senior unsecured term loan The term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from to based on the credit ratings on CRLP s unsecured debt from time to time We entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fixed the interest rate of the term loan through maturity at an all in initial interest rate of based on the initial margin of basis points The term loan matures on August The Term Loan Agreement contains various covenants and events of default that are more fully described in Note Financing Activities Senior Unsecured Term Loan in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Trust and CRLP included in Item of this Form K The proceeds from the term loan were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility As of December CRLP with the Trust as a guarantor had a million unsecured credit facility as amended the Credit Facility with Wells Fargo as Agent for the lenders Bank of America N A as Syndication Agent Citicorp North America Inc and Regions Bank as Co Documentation Agents and U S Bank National Association and PNC Bank National Association as Co Senior Managing Agents and other lenders named therein The Credit Facility has a maturity date of June In addition to the Credit Facility we have a million cash management line provided by Wells Fargo that will expire on June Base rate loans and revolving loans are available under the Credit Facility The Credit Facility also includes a competitive bid feature that allows us to convert up to million under the Credit Facility to a fixed rate and for a fixed term not to exceed days Generally base rate loans bear interest at Wells Fargo s designated base rate plus a base rate margin ranging up to based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time Revolving loans bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from to based on our unsecured debt ratings Competitive bid loans bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin as specified by the participating lenders Based on CRLP s current unsecured debt rating the revolving loans currently bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus basis points The Credit Facility and cash management line which have been primarily used to finance property acquisitions and developments and periodically to also fund repurchases of CRLP senior notes and preferred shares and units had outstanding balances at December of million and none respectively The weighted average interest rate of the Credit Facility including the cash management line was at December The Credit Facility contains various ratios and covenants that are more fully described in Note Financing Activities Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Trust and CRLP included in Item of this Form K As of December we were in compliance with these covenants We expect to be able to comply with these ratios and covenants in but no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants We currently expect to refinance the Credit Facility or enter into a new credit facility prior to the June maturity date However there can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any refinanced or new facility will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing credit facility See Item A in our Form K Risk Factors Risks Associated Table of Contents with Our Indebtedness and Financing Activities We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control which may affect our ability to pursue strategic opportunities satisfy our debt obligations and make distributions to our shareholders Distributions On January a cash distribution was declared to shareholders of the Trust in the amount of per common share and to partners of CRLP in the amount of per common unit totaling approximately million The per common share and per common unit distribution represents a increase per share unit when compared to the previous distribution The distribution was declared to shareholders and partners of record as of February and will be paid on February We also pay regular quarterly distributions on preferred units in CRLP to the extent outstanding As of December all remaining preferred units in CRLP had been repurchased The maintenance of these distributions is subject to various factors including the discretion of the Trust s Board of Trustees the Trust s ability to pay dividends under Alabama law the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of REIT distribution requirements which require at least of the Trust s taxable income to be distributed to the Trust s shareholders excluding net capital gains Collateralized Credit Facilities In the second quarter of CRLP closed on million of secured financing originated by Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC for repurchase by Fannie Mae The financing has a ten year term carries a fixed interest rate of and is secured by three multifamily properties Under this facility accrued interest is required to be paid monthly with no scheduled principal payments required prior to the maturity date The proceeds from this financing were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility During CRLP obtained two secured financings from Fannie Mae i a million collateralized credit facility collateralized with of our multifamily apartment communities totaling units which has a weighted average interest rate of and a maturity date of March and ii a million collateralized credit facility collateralized by eight of our multifamily apartment communities totaling units which has a weighted average interest rate of and a maturity date of June For both facilities accrued interest is required to be paid monthly with no scheduled principal payments required prior to the maturity date The proceeds from these financings were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility Unsecured Senior Note Maturities In April the Company s senior note matured which the Company satisfied with a gross payment of million million of principal and million of accrued interest using proceeds from the December at the market equity offering program and borrowings under the Credit Facility In December the Company had a million interest MTN Note and a million interest MTN Note mature Both notes were satisfied by a gross payment of million million of principal and million of previously accrued interest using proceeds from the December at the market equity offering program and borrowings under the Credit Facility Equity Repurchases During December CRLP repurchased million of its outstanding Series B Preferred Units from the existing holders for million plus accrued but unpaid dividends which represented a discount to the original issuance price and resulted in a million gain As a result of the repurchase during the year ended December we recognized a million charge associated with the write off of the original preferred unit issuance costs During December CRLP repurchased million of its outstanding Series B Preferred Units from the existing holders for million plus accrued but unpaid dividends which represented a discount to the original issuance price and resulted in a million gain As a result of the repurchase during the year ended December we recognized a million charge associated with the write off of the original preferred unit issuance costs In September the Trust redeemed all of the outstanding depositary shares each representing of a share of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest par value per share the Series D Preferred Shares which were originally issued in April for a redemption price of per Series D Preferred Depositary Share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends for an aggregate redemption price per Series D Preferred Table of Contents Depositary Share of or million in the aggregate As a result of the redemption during the year ended December we recognized a million charge associated with the write off of the original preferred share issuance costs Unsecured Senior Note Repurchases On January the Trust s Board of Trustees authorized an unsecured notes repurchase program which allowed for the repurchase of up to million of outstanding unsecured senior notes of CRLP through December During the year ended December we repurchased million in unsecured senior notes of CRLP at a discount to par value which represents a yield to maturity and resulted in the recognition of million in net gains For information regarding senior note repurchases in see Note Financing Activities Unsecured Senior Notes Repurchases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Trust and CRLP contained in Item of this Form K Market Risk In the normal course of business we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow We limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk However interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition The table below presents the principal amounts weighted average interest rates fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at December Estimated Fair in thousands Thereafter Total Value Fixed Rate Debt Average interest rate at December Variable Rate Debt Average interest rate at December _____________________________ Represents amount outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December which matures on June The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December It does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date Moreover because firm commitments are not presented in the table above the information presented therein has limited predictive value As a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at that time and interest rates As of December we had approximately million of outstanding variable rate debt We do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our variable rate debt is material in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt and our billion of total assets as of December If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million This assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains approximately million the balance as of December Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements To accomplish this objective we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an upfront premium Table of Contents On June we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuance This interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of August On July we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuance This interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million a fixed interest rate of and a maturity date of August These interest rate swaps became effective on July when we entered into a new million term loan as discussed above The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings as Interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings as a Loss on hedging activities During the years ended December and we accelerated the reclassification of amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Loss on hedging activities related to interest payments on the hedged debt were deemed probable not to occur as a result of the repurchases of senior notes of CRLP The accelerated amounts were a loss of million and million for the years ended December and respectively We did not reclassify amounts to Loss on hedging activities for the year ended December Amounts reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassified to Interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt The changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for reclassifications to Interest expense tied to interest payments on the hedged debt were million million and million during the years ended December and respectively Over the next twelve months the Company expects to reclassify million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to Interest expense As of December the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk Interest Rate Derivative Number of Instruments Notional Amount in thousands Interest Rate Swaps Further we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments The following tables summarize the material

development cost in Gain loss from sales of property in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss of the Trust and CRLP As a result of transactions executed in we implemented our strategic initiative to become a multifamily focused REIT which included two significant joint venture transactions whereby the majority of our wholly owned commercial properties were transferred into separate joint ventures In December we disposed of our interest in one of these joint ventures but continue to retain an interest in the other joint venture In connection with the joint venture transactions the Trust assumed certain contingent obligations of which million remains outstanding as of December The liabilities are the direct obligation of the Trust and thus are not reflected in the balance sheets of CRLP As of December we are self insured up to million million and million for general liability workers compensation and property insurance respectively We are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for amounts up to per claim and up to million per person For a discussion of certain ongoing litigation matters see Item Legal Proceedings In addition we are involved in various other lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business many of which are expected to be covered by liability insurance In the opinion of management although the outcomes of those normal course suits and claims are uncertain in the aggregate they should not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Guarantees and Other Arrangements Active Guarantees In connection with the formation of Highway LLC in we executed a guarantee pursuant to which we serve as a guarantor of million of the debt related to the joint venture which is collateralized by the Colonial Promenade Hoover retail property Our maximum guarantee of million may be requested by the lender only after all of the rights and remedies available under the associated note and security agreements have been exercised and exhausted At December the total amount of debt of the joint venture which matures on January was approximately million At December no liability was recorded for the guarantee In connection with certain retail developments we have received funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs In most cases the municipalities issue bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development We have guaranteed the shortfall if any of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on the bonds issued for our Colonial Promenade Tannehill development which had approximately million outstanding at December At December no liability was recorded for the guarantee As of December we had satisfied the minimum debt service coverage ratio necessary to cancel the guarantee and were awaiting confirmation of the cancellation from the bondholders The fair value of the above guarantees could change in the near term if the markets in which these properties are located deteriorate or if there are other negative indicators Terminated Guarantee During April the Company and its joint venture partner each guaranteed up to million for an aggregate of up to million of a construction loan obtained by TA Colonial Traditions LLC the Colonial Grand at Traditions joint venture in which the Company has a interest In September the Company determined it was probable that it would have to fund the partial loan repayment guarantee and accordingly million was recorded for the guarantee on September On June the Company purchased the outstanding mortgage loan from the lender for million As a result Table of Contents of the purchase the Company s million original partial loan guarantee was eliminated However the joint venture partner s guarantee remains in place The construction loan which had a balance of million including accrued interest as of June matured by its terms on April and as a result was in default at the time of the Company s acquisition On August the Company acquired the joint venture s property through foreclosure For additional information regarding ongoing litigation between us and our joint venture partner involving this property see Item Legal Proceedings Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our pro rata share of mortgage debt

Receivable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Trust and CRLP contained in Item of this Form K We intend to cooperate with our joint venture partners in connection with their efforts to refinance and or replace debt which cooperation may include additional capital contributions from time to time in connection therewith There can be no assurance that our joint ventures will be successful in refinancing and or replacing existing debt at maturity or otherwise If the joint ventures are unable to obtain additional financing payoff the existing loans that are maturing or renegotiate suitable terms with the existing lenders the lenders generally would have the right to foreclose on the properties in question and accordingly the joint ventures will lose their interests in the assets The failure to refinance and or replace such debt and other factors with respect to our joint venture interests discussed in Item A Risk Factors included in this Form K may materially adversely impact the value of our joint venture interests which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations Under our various unconsolidated joint venture non recourse mortgage loans we could under certain circumstances be responsible for portions of the mortgage indebtedness in connection with the certain customary non recourse carve out provisions such as environmental conditions misuse of funds and material misrepresentations In addition as more fully described above we have made certain guarantees in connection with our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures We do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity or capital resources Summary of Critical Accounting Policies We believe our accounting policies are in conformity with GAAP The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies including making estimates and assumptions These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements A comprehensive listing of our significant accounting policies is discussed in Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Trust and CRLP contained in Item of this Form K We consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our reported operating results Principles of Consolidation We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling interest or entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary under ASC Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities Variable interest entities VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability The primary beneficiary the entity that directs the most significant business activities of the VIE is required to consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Residential properties are leased under operating leases with terms of generally one year or less Rental revenues from residential leases are recognized on the straight line method over the approximate life of the leases which is generally one year The recognition of rental revenues from residential leases when earned has historically not been materially different from rental revenues recognized on a straight line basis Under the terms of residential leases the residents of our residential communities are obligated to reimburse us for certain utility usage cable water electricity and trash where we are the primary obligor to the public utility entity These utility reimbursements from residents are included as Other property related revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income Loss of the Trust and CRLP Rental income attributable to commercial leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases Certain commercial leases contain provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of tenant sales Percentage rents are recognized in the period in which sales thresholds are met Recoveries from tenants for taxes insurance and other property operating expenses are recognized in the period the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the terms of the related lease Sales and the associated gains or losses on real estate assets condominium conversion projects and for sale residential projects including developed condominiums are recognized in accordance with ASC Real Estate Sales For condominium conversion and for sale residential projects sales and the associated gains for individual condominium units are recognized upon the closing of the sale transactions as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met We use the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium conversion and for sale residential sales Real Estate Assets Impairment and Depreciation Land buildings and equipment is stated at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value Undeveloped land and construction in progress is stated at cost unless such assets are impaired in which case such assets are recorded at fair value We review our long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset If an asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value Assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell We determine fair value based on inputs management believes are consistent with those other market participants would use The fair values of these assets are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including i discounted cash flow analysis which considers among other things unit sales assumptions leasing assumptions cost structure growth rates discount rates and terminal capitalization rates ii income capitalization approach which considers prevailing market capitalization rates and iii comparable sales activity The valuation technique and related inputs vary with the specific facts and circumstances of each project Estimates are significantly impacted by estimates of sales price selling velocity sales incentives construction costs and other factors Due to uncertainties in the estimation process actual results could differ from such estimates For those assets deemed to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is to be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows Useful Lives Buildings years Furniture fixtures and equipment years Land improvements or years Tenant improvements Life of lease Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred Replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets Cost Capitalization Costs incurred during pre development are capitalized after we have identified a development site determined that a project is feasible and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed While we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects it is possible that a write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur Once it is no longer probable that a development will be successful the pre development costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed The capitalization of costs during the development of assets including interest property taxes and other direct costs begins when an active development commences and ends when the asset or a portion of an asset is delivered and is ready for its intended use Cost capitalization during redevelopment of assets including interest and other direct costs begins when the Table of Contents asset is taken out of service for redevelopment and ends when the asset redevelopment is completed and the asset is placed in service Acquisition of Real Estate Assets We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with ASC Business Combinations which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of above market and below market leases other value of in place leases and value of other tenant relationships based in each case on the fair values We allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant The as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets We also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms We record acquired intangible assets including above market leases customer relationships and in place leases and acquired intangible liabilities including below market leases at their estimated fair value separate and apart from goodwill We amortize identified intangible assets and liabilities that are determined to have finite lives over the period the assets and liabilities are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value Inflation Leases at our multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal Leases at our office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease Substantially all of the leases at our retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs including real estate taxes common area maintenance expenses and insurance All of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and therefore serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation An increase in general price levels may immediately precede or accompany an increase in interest rates At December our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by our high percentage of consolidated fixed rate debt As it relates to the short term an increase in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest Funds From Operations Funds from Operations FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT means income loss before noncontrolling interest determined in accordance with GAAP excluding sales of depreciated property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures FFO is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance We believe that FFO is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance This is because by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance FFO can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity REITs FFO is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry We believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of operations entitled Net income loss available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves Thus NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of REIT operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation among other items from GAAP net income Management believes that the use of FFO combined with the required primary GAAP presentations has been fundamentally beneficial improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful On October NAREIT issued updated guidance on FFO indicating that all companies should exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets when computing FFO Previously our calculation of FFO did not exclude Table of Contents impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets Therefore we have changed our presentation of FFO to exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate assets for all periods presented Of the years presented herein our FFO in and was impacted by this change in presentation In addition to Management evaluating the operating performance of our reportable segments based on FFO results Management uses FFO and FFO per share along with other measures to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees Our method of calculating FFO may be different from methods used by other REITs and accordingly may not be comparable to such other REITs FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of financial performance as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs including our ability to make distributions The following information is provided to reconcile net income available to common shareholders of the Trust the most comparable GAAP measure to FFO and to show the items included in our FFO for the years ended December and Years Ended

		<c><![CDATA[ We intend for the following discussion to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements the changes in key items in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how particular accounting principles affect our financial statements This discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business so you may better understand how those segments and their results affect our financial condition and results of operations as a whole Finally we have identified and discussed trends known to management that we believe are likely to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of December and and the two years then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements You are also urged to consider the information under the caption Summary of Critical Accounting Policies Summary We are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items Our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores We have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices The key to our success is our ability to grow our base business We grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations We intend to continue to expand both domestically and internationally We operate in three segments First Wholesale Leathercraft consisting of our Leather Factory stores and our national account sales group which sells to large national store chains is our oldest segment with sales of million in Historically in normal economic conditions this division has generally offered steady but very modest increases in sales Sales in increased compared to Compared to the wholesale stores sales increased and national account sales were up Sales at our stores are showing signs of recovery despite cautious consumer spending as a result of the weak U S economy Sales to national accounts tend to be less consistent Since acquiring its assets in Tandy Leather has been re established as the operator of retail leathercraft stores Prior to our acquisition in all of the Tandy Leather retail stores had been closed These retail stores comprise our Retail Leathercraft segment This segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in up from million in and is our largest source of revenues We expect to grow the number of stores to from stores in operation at the end of Our pace of store openings has slowed in the last several years due to the general economic conditions in the U S and because of the lack of personnel qualified for store manager positions We expect to continue to open stores domestically but have not committed to a specific time frame at this point While the store opening schedule has slowed we are generally attempting to relocate existing stores as the leases come up for renewal into larger spaces so that a larger amount of product is available to customers We believe that the increase in sales in this segment suggests that the store relocation strategy is successful Our International Leathercraft segment consists of company owned stores located outside of North America At December two combination retail wholesale stores with one located in the United Kingdom and the other located in Australia comprised this segment In January we opened a store in Spain bringing the number of stores in this segment to three It is our intention to open more stores in this segment once we have a large enough customer base to support additional stores On a consolidated basis a key indicator of costs gross margin as a percent of total net sales increased in and in Operating expenses increased at a slightly slower pace than that of sales increasing between and and between and We reported consolidated net income for of million Consolidated net income for and was million and million respectively We use our cash flow to fund our operations to fund the opening of new stores to purchase necessary property and equipment and to make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market In we incurred million in bank debt to purchase a square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units We moved into that facility in the first quarter of In we paid a one time dividend to our stockholders totaling million At the end of our stockholders equity had increased to million from million the previous year Comparing the December balance sheet with the prior year s balance sheet we decreased our investment in inventory from million to million while total cash including certificates of deposit increased from million to million TABLE OF CONTENTS Net Sales Net sales for the three years ended December were as follows Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company Incr from Prior Year Our net sales increased by in when compared with and increased by in when compared with In and all three segments reported sales increases compared to the prior year Costs and Expenses In general our gross profit as a percentage of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally Our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors Sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels Therefore as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix higher gross margins tend to follow Finally there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer As a result our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period For our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to Our cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to Fluctuations in gross margin are primarily due to sales mix Retail sales are at a higher gross margin than that of wholesale sales Therefore as retail sales increase at a faster pace than that of wholesale sales gross margin increases accordingly Our gross margins for the three years ended December were as follows Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company Our operating expenses decreased minimally as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew slightly slower than our sales during this period operating expenses were million higher than those of Significant expense fluctuations in compared to are as follows Expense amount Incr Decr over Employee compensation benefits million million Travel expense Credit card fees Rent utilities million Professional fees and licenses million Freight out shipping product to customers million The increase in employee compensation and benefits is due primarily to the increase in store manager compensation Our store managers are paid a percentage of the operating profit generated by the store they manage as additional compensation so as store profits increase manager compensation increases Also included in benefits is our employee health benefit plan which has seen consistent cost increases compared to prior years Our operating expenses decreased as a percentage of total net sales to in when compared with in This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew more slowly than our sales during this period operating expenses were million higher than those of Significant expense fluctuations in compared to are as follows Expense amount Incr Decr over Employee compensation benefits million million Travel expense Credit card fees Rent utilities million Professional fees and licenses Freight out shipping product to customers million Loss on disposal of equipment Other Income Expense net Other Income Expense consists primarily of currency exchange fluctuations interest income and interest expense In we had other expense net of

to in In we had other expense net of compared to other expense net of in We received in gas royalties We earned in interest income on our cash and paid in interest expense on our bank debt We had a currency exchange loss of in compared to in During we earned net income of million a increase over our net income of million earned during The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit partially offset by the increase in operating expenses and income tax expense During we earned net income of million a increase over our net income of million earned during The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit partially offset by the increase in operating expenses TABLE OF CONTENTS Wholesale Leathercraft The increases or decreases in net sales operating income operating income increases or decreases and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Wholesale Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December were as follows Year Net Sales Incr Decr from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income Incr Decr from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales Wholesale Leathercraft consisting of our wholesale stores and our national account group accounted for of our consolidated net sales in which compares to in and in The decrease in this division s contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in Retail Leathercraft and we expect this trend to continue while retail consumers buying patterns continue to strengthen over that of wholesale and small businesses Sales in the wholesale stores increased in compared to sales in while the sales increase in our national account group was from to By customer group we increased sales in the wholesale stores significantly to our retail customers while sales to our wholesale and national account customers remained consistent with The most significant decreases were in our institution and manufacturer groups which have been significantly affected by the weakness in the U S economy Our sales mix by customer group in the Wholesale Leathercraft division was as follows Customer Group Retail Institution Wholesale National Accounts Manufacturers In operating income as a percentage of divisional sales remained consistent with the prior year at Significant operating expense increases occurred in employee compensation employee benefits and supplies offset somewhat by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses and bad debt expenses The increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease in operating expenses of Significant operating expense decreases occurred in loss on disposal of equipment depreciation and bad debts offset somewhat by increases in employee compensation and travel expenses Retail Leathercraft The increases in net sales operating income operating income increases or decreases and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Retail Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December were as follows Year Net Sales Increase from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income Incr Decr from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales Reflecting the growth previously discussed Retail Leathercraft accounted for of our total net sales in up from in and in Growth in net sales for our Retail Leathercraft division in

expenses as a percent of sales in decreased by from for to for as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than that of sales We intend to continue the expansion of Tandy Leather s retail store chain over the next several years with plans to open at least one store in in North America We remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability In the current economic environment in the U S it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in if we determine that feasibility of additional successful openings is likely International Leathercraft International Leathercraft consists of all stores located outside of North America As of December that represents two retail wholesale combination stores with one located in the United Kingdom and the other in Australia A third store was opened in January located in Spain International Leathercraft accounted for and of our total sales in and respectively Operating income was and in and respectively We expect this segment to become a larger part of our total operations as our international customer base continues to grow We intend to expand our International Leathercraft segment by opening one to two new stores in We opened a store in Spain in January and anticipate another store opening in the last half of the year The number and timing of store openings will be subject to compliance with all local legal requirements lease negotiations and execution and completion of the finish out of the stores TABLE OF CONTENTS Financial Condition At December we held million of cash and certificates of deposit million of inventory accounts receivable of million and million of property and equipment Goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were and respectively Net total assets were million Current liabilities were million including of current maturities of long term debt while long term debt was million Total stockholders equity at the end of was million At December we held million of cash and certificates of deposit million of inventory accounts receivable of million and million of property and equipment Goodwill and other intangibles net of amortization and depreciation were and respectively Net total assets were million Current liabilities were million including of current maturities of long term debt while long term debt was million Total stockholders equity at the end of was million Specific ratios on a consolidated basis at the end of each year ended December were as

Current Liabilities Accounts Payable to Sales Accounts Payable Sales Profitability Ratios Return on Sales Profit Margin Net Profit After Taxes Sales Return on Assets Net Profit After Taxes Total Assets Return on Net Worth Return on Equity Net Profit After Taxes Net Worth Capital Resources and Liquidity On July we entered into a Credit Agreement and Line of Credit Note with JPMorgan Chase Bank N A pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit facility of up to to facilitate our purchase and remodel of real estate consisting of a square foot building situated on acres of land located at SE Loop in Fort Worth Texas Proceeds in the amount of were used to fund the initial purchase of the property On April that amount was rolled into a ten year term note and we began making monthly debt service payments in May We are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the JPMorgan Chase Credit Agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements The principal terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are described in further detail in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements Notes Payable and Long Term Debt Reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness as well as dividend payments during the periods our financing activities for and required net cash of million million and million respectively The one time special dividend paid in July of million is the reason for the significant increase in financing activities in compared to and Our primary source of liquidity and capital resources during was cash flow provided by operating activities Net cash flow from operations for and was million million and million respectively The decrease in operating cash flow in was due to the increase in inventory in the last half of In cash flow from operations was generated from income the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in accrued expenses In and cash flow from operations was generated from income partially offset by the increase in inventory Consolidated accounts receivable increased to million at December compared to million at December Average days to collect accounts increased from days in to days in on a consolidated basis We maintain a tight credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectability We believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the U S economy Many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses Inventory decreased from million at the end of to million at December We are pleased with the slight reduction in our inventory investment at December However as we continue our store expansion and relocation we expect our inventory to increase Further continued sales increases are partially dependent on product availability in our stores We will continue to look for large purchasing opportunities of product at aggressive pricing in order to support our gross margin goals We attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected expansion We ended the year with our total inventory on hand approximately below our internal targets for optimal inventory Consolidated inventory turned times during a slight improvement from the turns at times We compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory By operating division inventory turns are as follows Segment Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Wholesale Leathercraft stores only Retail Leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of Wholesale Leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores The retail stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse Wholesale Leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores Accounts payable totaled million at the end of up from million at the end of TABLE OF CONTENTS As discussed above the largest use of operating cash in was the decrease in accrued expenses specifically the decrease in the amount of inventory in transit Cash paid for capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended December and respectively In the primary capital expenditure was store fixtures either for new stores or for relocated or remodeled stores Fixtures and equipment for the new international stores totaled We moved or remodeled stores in the US in Fixtures for those stores totaled Fixtures for the new U S store opened in totaled Other capital expenditures were building improvements including a video surveillance system computer equipment website development and factory machines and dies In the primary capital expenditure was the construction of a building to be used for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the staging of drop shipments of specially purchased product to our stores Other capital expenditures were building improvements including a generator store fixtures computer equipment and factory machines and dies We intend to open one to two stores in the U S and one to two stores abroad in having already opened one store in Spain in January and therefore we expect to incur some capital expenditures related to these store openings In addition we intend to continue to relocate US stores into larger space as leases permit and therefore expect to incur capital expenditures namely fixtures related to these moves Therefore we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to that of our expenditures Cash applied toward stock repurchases totaled and in and respectively There were no stock repurchases in We believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in while also funding our expansion plans At this time we know of no trends or demands commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity capital resources or results of operations In addition we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments We could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow In particular because of the relatively small investment required by each new store we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during and and we do not currently have any such arrangements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December not including related interest expense Payments Due by Periods Contractual Obligations Total Less than Year Years Years More than Years Long Term Debt Operating Leases Total Contractual Obligations ____________________ Our loan from JPMorgan Chase matures in May These are our leased facilities Summary of Critical Accounting Policies We strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology We follow generally accepted accounting principles in the U S in preparing our consolidated financial statements These principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations We continually review our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements Following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements Basis of Consolidation We report our financial information on a consolidated basis Therefore unless there is an indication to the contrary financial information is provided for the parent company Tandy Leather Factory Inc and its subsidiaries as a whole Transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose We own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated None of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured which generally occurs upon shipment Net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances product returns and allowances for defective merchandise Allowance for Accounts Receivable We reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future This allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition past collection history and the aging of the account If the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments additional allowances may be required Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in first out method This means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold In addition we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory This reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand If actual future demand is less favorable than what we project additional write downs may be necessary Goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier Goodwill We periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carrying value As of December we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the operating divisions associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances If actual financial performance of these divisions differs significantly from our projections such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the SEC or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events Words such as may assume forecast position predict strategy expect intend plan estimate anticipate believe project budget potential or continue and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements They can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties Consequently no forward looking statements can be guaranteed Actual results may vary materially You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to the risk factors described in Item A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form K Management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements We do not intend to update forward looking statements TABLE OF CONTENTS We face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates These exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results We do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our foreign subsidiaries as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates impact the U S dollar amount of revenue and expenses See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Information for financial information concerning our foreign activities Interest Rate Risk In the past we have been subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt However our current credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase includes a fixed interest rate Therefore changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area TABLE OF CONTENTS

by an increase of million from the Comparable Properties and an increase of million from the New Properties The purchase of the additional interest in Parkway Place in October comprised million of the increase from the Comparable Properties The remaining increase in rental revenues and tenant reimbursements of the Comparable Properties was primarily driven by a million increase in minimum rents as a result of overall improvement in leasing spreads and higher occupancy levels Our cost recovery ratio decreased to for compared to for primarily due to a decline in tenant reimbursements as discussed above as well as increased utilities expense The increase in management development and leasing fees of million was mainly attributable to the management fees from the CBL T C Properties after the

due to higher expenses of million related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties partially offset by a decrease of million in abandoned projects expense Other Income and Expenses Interest and other income decreased million in compared to the prior year period due to the elimination of interest income on advances to two joint ventures and a mortgage note receivable We stopped receiving interest on one joint venture to which we had outstanding advances when it was sold in June and in October we purchased our partner s share of the joint venture that owned Parkway Place to which we previously had outstanding advances In addition interest income is no longer being accrued on a mortgage note receivable for which we foreclosed on the land that served as collateral on the loan Interest expense decreased million in compared to the prior year The CBL T C Properties comprised million of the decrease which was partially offset by an increase of million related to the New Properties The remaining decrease was primarily related to our continued efforts to deleverage our balance sheet as we decreased our consolidated debt by million to million from December to December Additionally during the second and third quarters of our secured credit facilities were modified to remove a floor on LIBOR and to reduce the amount of the spreads above LIBOR based on our leverage During we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of million as a result of accelerated premium amortization related to the early retirement of debt on two malls We

Equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million during One joint venture Property that opened in March contributed to the increase compared to the prior year Increases in revenues and tenant reimbursements were key drivers at several unconsolidated Properties reflecting improved occupancy and rental rates consistent with the Comparable Properties Additionally our share of the earnings of the CBL T C Properties accounted for million of the increase In addition outparcel sales increased approximately million compared to the prior year These increases were partially offset by a decline in earnings from Parkway Place as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interest from our joint venture partner in October Results of Parkway Place are now reported on a consolidated basis Table of Contents The income tax benefit of million in primarily relates to our taxable REIT subsidiary and consists of a current tax provision of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million During we recorded an income tax benefit of million consisting of a current tax benefit of million partially offset by a deferred income tax provision of million Our taxable REIT subsidiary had higher income in compared to primarily as a result of an increase in the management fee income from our own portfolio of Properties Because this fee income is from our consolidated

million reflects the operating results of one mall that was sold in February for million Net proceeds from the sale were used to retire the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of million on the non recourse loan secured by the Property in accordance with the lender s agreement to modify the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest to equal the net sales price for the Property As a result we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt of million We also recorded a loss on impairment of real estate of million to write down the book value of the Property to the net

December Total revenues declined by million for compared to the prior year Rental revenues and tenant reimbursements declined by million due to a decrease of million from the Comparable Properties partially offset by an increase of million from the New Properties The decrease in revenues of the Comparable Properties was primarily driven by declines of million in tenant reimbursements and million in lease termination fees Tenant reimbursements decreased primarily due to certain tenants converting their lease payment terms to percentage in lieu or base rent Tenant reimbursements also were impacted by negative leasing spreads over the past year Table of Contents Our cost recovery ratio decreased to for from for primarily due to the decline in tenant reimbursements discussed above The decrease in management development and leasing fees of million was mainly attributable to lower development fee income due to the completion in or early of certain joint venture developments that were under construction during the prior year period Other revenues increased million primarily due to higher revenues related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties Operating Expenses Total expenses decreased million for compared to the prior year Property operating expenses including real estate taxes and maintenance and repairs decreased million

Properties is primarily attributable to reductions of million in promotion related costs million in bad debt expense million in contracted security and maintenance expenses and million in state tax expense Property operating expenses continued to benefit from the cost containment program that we implemented in late and Bad debt expense decreased as a result of less store closure activity compared to the prior year The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense of million resulted from a decrease of million from the Comparable Properties partially offset by an increase of million related to the New Properties The decrease attributable to the Comparable Properties is primarily due to a million decline in depreciation expense for buildings and a million decline in amortization of tenant allowances The decline in depreciation expense for buildings was primarily due to the write off of the value of certain buildings in the prior year that were reconstructed for new tenants in The decrease in amortization of tenant allowances was attributable to write offs of certain unamortized tenant allowances in the prior year period related to several store closings General and administrative expenses increased million primarily as a result of a reduction in capitalized overhead of million coupled with an increase of million in consulting fees and legal expenses

section herein for further discussion of impairment charges Other expenses decreased million primarily due to a decrease of million in abandoned projects expense partially offset by higher expenses of million related to our subsidiary that provides security and maintenance services to third parties Other Income and Expenses Interest expense decreased million in compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average fixed and variable interest rates on our outstanding debt and lower overall debt levels as compared to the prior year as a result of efforts to deleverage our balance sheet including the preferred stock offerings we completed in This decrease was partially offset by a decline in capitalized interest due to the opening of the New Properties in During we

losses totaling million We recorded a charge of million on our investment in Jinsheng Group Jinsheng an established mall operating and real estate development company located in Nanjing China due to a decline in expected future cash flows The decrease was a result of declining occupancy and sales due to the then downturn of the real estate market in China We also recorded a million charge related

eight parcels of land We recognized a gain on sales of real estate assets of million during from the sale of six parcels of land Equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by million during primarily due to capital transactions related to two of our joint venture Properties that are owned with the same partner During the third quarter of our joint venture partner contributed a significant amount of capital to one of the Properties and we received a substantial non cash distribution from the other Property These capital events had a one time negative effect due to the resulting change in the allocation of earnings based on the waterfall provisions of each joint venture agreement Table of Contents The income tax benefit of million in primarily relates to our taxable REIT subsidiary and consists of a current tax benefit of million partially offset by a deferred income tax provision of million During we recorded an income tax benefit of million consisting

community centers sold in and one mall and one community centers sold in plus the true up of estimated expenses to actual amounts for Properties sold during previous years Discontinued operations for includes a gain of million related to the disposition of these Properties Operational Review The shopping center business is to some extent seasonal in nature with tenants typically achieving the highest levels of sales during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season which generally results in higher percentage rents in the fourth quarter Additionally the malls earn most of their rents from short term tenants during the holiday period Thus occupancy levels and revenue production are generally the highest in the fourth quarter of each year Results of operations realized in any one quarter may not be indicative of the results likely to be experienced over the course of the fiscal year We classify our regional malls into two categories malls that have completed their initial lease up are referred to as stabilized malls and malls that are in their initial lease up phase and have not been open for three calendar years are referred to as non stabilized malls Pearland Town Center which opened in and The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City which opened in August are our only non stabilized malls as of December We derive a significant amount of our revenues from the Mall Properties The sources of our revenues by property type were as follows Year Ended December Malls Associated centers Community centers Mortgages office buildings and other Mall Store Sales Mall store sales for the year ended December on a comparable per square foot basis were per square foot compared with per square foot for representing an increase of As the general state of the economy improved in including a decline in the national unemployment rate and a rise in consumer confidence we experienced a resulting increase in sales across our portfolio in In addition retailers in general were highly promotional throughout the year especially during the holiday season which continued to attract the value oriented shopper We expect to see modest positive sales increases continue throughout the coming year as the economy continues to improve Occupancy Our portfolio occupancy is summarized in the following table December Total portfolio Total mall portfolio Stabilized malls Non stabilized malls Associated centers Community centers Impaired properties removed during the th quarter are Columbia Place Hickory Hollow Mall and Towne Mall Represents occupancy for Pearland Town Center and The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City Represents occupancy for Pearland Town Center Table of Contents Leasing activity continued to improve throughout the year as reflected in our occupancy increases We posted a basis point increase in the occupancy rate for our total portfolio compared to the prior year with stabilized mall occupancy improving by basis points over the prior year At December we anticipate an increase in occupancy levels ranging from flat to basis points compared with the prior year Leasing During we signed more than million square feet of leases including million square feet of leases in our operating portfolio and million square feet of development leases This compares with a total of approximately million square feet of leases signed during including million square feet of leases in our operating portfolio and million square feet of development leasing Average annual base rents per square foot were as follows for each property type December Stabilized malls Non stabilized malls Associated centers Community centers Office buildings Results from new and renewal leasing of comparable small shop space of less than square feet during the year ended December for spaces that were previously occupied are as follows Property Type Square Feet Prior Gross Rent PSF New Initial Gross Rent PSF Change Initial New Average Gross Rent PSF Change Average All Property Types Stabilized Malls New leases Renewal leases Includes stabilized malls associated centers community centers and office buildings Average gross rent does not incorporate allowable future increases for recoverable common area expenses For stabilized mall leasing in on a same space basis rental rates were signed at an average increase of from the prior gross rent per square foot for new and renewal leases We are pleased with the significant improvement over the prior year The ongoing improvement in sales has translated into steady demand from retailers which is reflected in our positive leasing spreads We are seeing a decreased frequency in the signing of shorter term leases in locations where space may not currently be renting at favorable rates We are pleased by this trend and believe this will continue throughout the year We will also be looking to improve the rental rates on shorter term deals that we have signed over the last twelve months as they expire With continued positive sales growth and steady demand from retailers we are optimistic about the leasing environment Liquidity and Capital Resources During the year ended December we closed on seventeen operating property loans totaling million Proceeds were primarily used to repay existing loans of approximately million and to pay down the outstanding balances of our million and million secured credit facilities During the second and third quarters of our three secured credit facilities were modified to remove a floor on LIBOR Without giving effect to actual LIBOR the removal of the floors and the reduction in the spreads resulted in a decrease in the interest rates on the million and million facilities of approximately and on the million facility of approximately We also executed extensions on the maturity of each of the facilities As of December we had approximately million available on all of our credit facilities combined We sold one mall in February for million and used the net proceeds to retire the million outstanding balance of principal and unpaid interest on the loan securing the Property and recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of million as the lender had agreed to modify the balance owed under the loan to equal the net cash sales price of the Property Table of Contents We also sold a community center in November for million and used the net proceeds of million to reduce the borrowings on the unsecured term loan used to acquire the Starmount Properties In October we closed on a billion joint venture with TIAA CREF in which TIAA CREF received a pari passu interest in each of Oak Park Mall in Kansas City KS West County Center in St Louis MO and CoolSprings Galleria in Nashville TN TIAA CREF also received a interest in Pearland Town Center in Pearland TX As part of the joint venture agreement TIAA CREF assumed approximately million of property specific debt Net proceeds of approximately million from the transaction were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings on our million and million credit facilities We derive a majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants which have historically been the primary source for funding short term liquidity and capital needs such as operating expenses debt service tenant construction allowances recurring capital expenditures dividends and distributions We believe that the combination of cash flows generated from our operations combined with our debt and equity sources and the availability under our lines of credit will for the foreseeable future provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash needs In addition to these factors we have options available to us to generate additional liquidity including but not limited to equity offerings joint venture investments issuances of noncontrolling interests in our Operating Partnership and decreasing the amount of expenditures we make related to tenant construction allowances and other capital expenditures We also generate revenues from sales of peripheral land at the Properties and from sales of real estate assets when it is determined that we can realize an optimal value for the assets Cash Flows From Operations There was million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of December an increase of million from December Cash provided by operating activities during increased million to million from million during The increase is primarily due the improved operating results of the Comparable Properties the addition of the results from the New Properties and lower interest expense as a result of lower debt levels in Debt The

LIBOR Pursuant to the terms of the modifications borrowings under these secured lines of credit bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable spread ranging from to based on our leverage ratio Without

Contents Shares Outstanding Stock Price Value Common stock and operating partnership units Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Total market equity Company s share of total debt Total market capitalization Debt to total market capitalization ratio Stock price for common stock and operating partnership units equals the closing price of our common stock on December The stock price for the preferred stock represents the liquidation preference of each respective series of preferred stock Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December dollars in thousands Payments Due By Period Total Less Than Year Years Years More Than Years Long term debt Total consolidated debt service Minority investors share in shopping center properties Our share of unconsolidated affiliates debt service Our share of total debt service obligations Operating leases Ground leases on consolidated properties Purchase obligations Construction contracts on consolidated properties Our share of construction contracts on unconsolidated properties Total contractual obligations Represents principal and interest payments due under the terms of mortgage and other indebtedness and includes of variable rate debt service on nine operating Properties three construction loans two secured credit facilities and two unsecured term facilities The variable rate loans on the operating Properties call for payments of interest only with the total principal due at maturity The construction loans and credit facilities do not require scheduled principal payments The future contractual obligations for all variable rate indebtedness reflect payments of interest only throughout the term of the debt with the total outstanding principal at December due at maturity The future interest payments are projected based on the interest rates that were in effect at December See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the terms of long term debt Includes of variable rate debt service Future contractual obligations have been projected using the same assumptions as used in above Obligations where we own the buildings and improvements but lease the underlying land under long term ground leases The maturities of these leases range from to and generally provide for renewal options Represents the remaining balance to be incurred under construction contracts that had been entered into as of December but were not complete The contracts are primarily for development of Properties Capital Expenditures Including our share of unconsolidated affiliates capital expenditures we spent million during the year ended December for tenant allowances which typically generate increased rents from tenants over the terms of their leases Deferred maintenance expenditures were million for the year ended December and included million for resurfacing and improved lighting of parking lots million for roof repairs and replacements and million for various other capital expenditures Renovation expenditures were million for the year ended December Table of Contents Deferred maintenance expenditures are generally billed to tenants as common area maintenance expense and most are recovered over a to year period Renovation expenditures are primarily for remodeling and upgrades of malls of which a portion is recovered from tenants over a to year period We are recovering these costs through fixed amounts with annual increases or pro rata cost reimbursements based on the tenant s occupied space We believe that it is important to reinvest in our Properties in order to enhance their dominant position in the market We recently announced our renovation program which includes upgrades at four of our Properties Renovations are scheduled to be completed at Cross Creek Mall in Fayetteville NC Post Oak Mall in College Station TX Turtle Creek Mall in Hattiesburg MS and Mall del Norte in Laredo TX by the end of Cross Creek Mall will receive updated entrances paint new interior decor and graphics upgraded amenities and new landscaping The renovation at Post Oak Mall will include new flooring and paint as well as new amenities such as soft seating areas updated entrances and lighting Turtle Creek Mall s renovations will include new flooring lighting landscape improvements and other upgrades The renovations at Mall del Norte will complete a series of upgrades begun in In addition the food courts of Cross Creek Mall Post Oak Mall and Turtle Creek Mall will receive completely new designs to include new tables and chairs Our total anticipated net investment in these renovations is approximately million The terms of the joint venture that we formed with TIAA CREF require us to fund certain capital expenditures related to parking decks at West County Center in the amount of million As of December we had funded million of this amount leaving million be funded in and Annual capital expenditures budgets are prepared for each of our Properties that are intended to provide for all necessary recurring and non recurring capital expenditures We believe that property operating cash flows which include reimbursements from tenants for certain expenses will provide the necessary funding for these expenditures Developments

completed renovation projects at four of our malls including Hamilton Place in Chattanooga TN Oak Park Mall in Kansas City KS RiverGate Mall in Nashville TN and Burnsville Center in Minneapolis MN On August we celebrated the grand opening of The Outlet Shoppes at Oklahoma City a joint venture outlet center in Oklahoma City OK in which we have a ownership interest It is the only outlet center in the state of Oklahoma and the only center of its kind within a mile radius The center opened fully leased with retailers including Saks Off th Nike Tommy Hilfiger Polo J Crew Brooks Brothers and more During the third quarter of the second phase of Settlers Ridge in Robinson Township PA opened leased or committed and is anchored by Michaels Ross Dress for Less Pet Supplies Plus and ULTA During the fourth quarter of the second phase of Alamance Crossing in Burlington NC opened leased or committed anchored by Dick s Sporting Goods Kohl s and BJ s We commenced construction on two new projects during the third quarter In Waynesville NC we are under construction for a community center that will be anchored by Belk along with PetSmart and Michaels located next to an existing Wal Mart We also started construction on the second phase of The Forum at Grandview our joint venture community center development in Madison MS The second phase will be anchored by ULTA HomeGoods and Petco We currently have two redevelopments under construction Two new state of the art screen movie theaters are scheduled to open within the next year at Foothills Mall in Maryville TN and Monroeville Mall in Pittsburgh PA along with a JC Penney at Monroeville Mall We should see a positive effect for the Properties and our portfolio by enhancing these existing centers We hold options to acquire certain development properties owned by third parties Except for the projects presented above we do not have any other material capital commitments as of December Acquisitions On September we purchased Northgate Mall located in Chattanooga TN for a total cash purchase price of million plus million of transaction costs Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Affiliates We have ownership interests in unconsolidated affiliates as of December that are described in Note to the consolidated financial statements The unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The following are circumstances when we may consider entering into a joint venture with a third party Third parties may approach us with opportunities in which they have obtained land and performed some pre development activities but they may not have sufficient access to the capital resources or the development and leasing expertise to bring the project to fruition We enter into such arrangements when we determine such a project is viable and we can achieve a satisfactory return on our investment We typically earn development fees from the joint venture and provide management and leasing services to the property for a fee once the property is placed in operation We determine that we may have the opportunity to capitalize on the value we have created in a Property by selling an interest in the Property to a third party This provides us with an additional source of capital that can be used to develop or acquire additional real estate assets that we believe will provide greater potential for growth When we retain an interest in an asset rather than selling a interest it is typically because this allows us to continue to manage the Property which provides us the ability to earn fees for management leasing development and financing services provided to the joint venture Preferred Joint Venture Units We consolidate our investment in a joint venture CW Joint Venture LLC CWJV with Westfield Group Westfield The terms of the joint venture agreement require that CWJV pay an annual preferred distribution at a rate of which increases to on July on the preferred liquidation value of the perpetual preferred joint venture units PJV units of CWJV that are held by Westfield Westfield has the right to have all or a portion of the PJV units redeemed by CWJV with property owned by CWJV and subsequent to October with either cash or property owned by CWJV in each case for a net equity amount equal to the preferred liquidation value of the PJV units At any time after January Westfield may propose that CWJV acquire certain qualifying property that would be used to redeem the PJV units at their preferred liquidation value If CWJV does not redeem the PJV units with such qualifying property a Preventing Event then the annual preferred distribution rate on the PJV units increases to beginning July We will have the right but not the obligation to offer to redeem the PJV units from January through January at their preferred liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid distributions If we fail to make such an offer the annual preferred distribution rate on the PJV units increases to for the period from July through June at which time it decreases to if a Preventing Event has not occurred If upon redemption of the PJV units the fair value of our common stock is greater than per share then such excess but in no case greater than million in the aggregate shall be added to the aggregate preferred liquidation value payable on account of the PJV units We account for this contingency using the method prescribed for earnings or other performance measure contingencies As such should this contingency result in additional consideration to Westfield we will record the current fair value of the consideration issued as a purchase price adjustment at the time the consideration is paid or payable Guarantees We may guarantee the debt of a joint venture primarily because it allows the joint venture to obtain funding at a lower cost than could be obtained otherwise This results in a higher return for the joint venture on its investment and a higher return on our investment in the joint venture We may receive a fee from the joint venture for providing the guaranty Additionally when we issue a guaranty the terms of the joint venture agreement typically provide that we may receive indemnification from the joint venture partner or have the ability to increase our ownership interest We own a parcel of land in Lee s Summit MO that we are ground leasing to a third party development company The third party developed and operates a shopping center on the land parcel We have guaranteed of the third party s construction loan and bond line of credit the loans of which the initial maximum guaranteed amount was million During the loans were partially paid down and amended such that our maximum guaranteed amount representing of capacity is approximately million at December The total amount outstanding at December on the loans was million of which we have guaranteed million The Company reported an obligation of million and million as of December and December respectively in its consolidated balance sheets to reflect the estimated fair value of the guaranty Table of Contents We have guaranteed of the construction and land loans of West Melbourne I LLC West Melbourne an unconsolidated affiliate in which we own a interest of which the maximum guaranteed amount is million West Melbourne developed and operates Hammock Landing a community center in West Melbourne FL The total amount outstanding on the loans at December was million The guaranty will expire upon repayment of the debt The land loan and the construction loan each representing million and million respectively of the amount outstanding at December mature in November We recorded an obligation of million and million in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December and respectively to reflect the estimated fair value of this guaranty We have guaranteed of the construction loan of Port Orange I LLC Port Orange an unconsolidated affiliate in which we own a interest of which the maximum guaranteed amount is million Port Orange developed and operates The Pavilion at Port Orange a community center in Port Orange FL The total amount outstanding at December on the loan was million The guaranty will expire upon repayment of debt The loan matures in March and has a one year extension option available We have recorded an obligation of million and million in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December and respectively to reflect the estimated fair value of this guaranty We have guaranteed the lease performance of York Town Center LP YTC an unconsolidated affiliate in which we own a interest under the terms of an agreement with a third party that owns property as part of York Town Center Under the terms of that agreement YTC is obligated to cause performance of the third party s obligations as landlord under its lease with its sole tenant including but not limited to provisions such as co tenancy and exclusivity requirements Should YTC fail to cause performance then the tenant under the third party landlord s lease may pursue certain remedies ranging from rights to terminate its lease to receiving reductions in rent We have guaranteed YTC s performance under this agreement up to a maximum of million which decreases by million annually until the guaranteed amount is reduced to million The guaranty expires on December The maximum guaranteed obligation was million as of December We entered into an agreement with our joint venture partner under which the joint venture partner has agreed to reimburse us of any amounts we are obligated to fund under the guaranty We did not record an obligation for this guaranty because we determined that the fair value of the guaranty is not material We guaranteed of a construction loan of JG Gulf Coast Town Center LLC an unconsolidated affiliate in which we own a interest of which the maximum guaranteed amount was million We did not record an obligation for this guaranty because we determined that the fair value of the guaranty is not material The guaranty expired during the second quarter of when JG Gulf Coast Town Center LLC retired the construction loan Our guarantees and the related accounting are more fully described in Note to the consolidated financial statements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP In connection with the preparation of our financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the related disclosures We base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared On a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP However because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements Management believes that the following critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements We have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors For a discussion of our significant accounting policies see Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item of this Annual Report on Form K Revenue Recognition Minimum rental revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases Certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent if their sales volumes exceed thresholds specified in their lease agreements Percentage rent is recognized as revenue when the thresholds are achieved and the amounts become determinable Table of Contents We receive reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes insurance common area maintenance and other recoverable operating expenses as provided in the lease agreements Tenant reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the related operating expenses are incurred Tenant reimbursements related to certain capital expenditures are billed to tenants over periods of to years and are recognized as revenue in accordance with underlying lease terms We receive management leasing and development fees from third parties and unconsolidated affiliates Management fees are charged as a percentage of revenues as defined in the management agreement and are recognized as revenue when earned Development fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the development period Leasing fees are charged for newly executed leases and lease renewals and are recognized as revenue when earned Development and leasing fees received from unconsolidated affiliates during the development period are recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest Fees to the extent of our ownership interest are recorded as a reduction to our investment in the unconsolidated affiliate Gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized when it is determined that the sale has been consummated the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate our receivable if any is not subject to future subordination and the buyer has assumed the usual risks and rewards of ownership of the asset When we have an ownership interest in the buyer gain is recognized to the extent of the third party partner s ownership interest and the portion of the gain attributable to our ownership interest is deferred Real Estate Assets We capitalize predevelopment project costs paid to third parties All previously capitalized predevelopment costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the project will be completed Once development of a project commences all direct costs incurred to construct the project including interest and real estate taxes are capitalized Additionally certain general and administrative expenses are allocated to the projects and capitalized based on the amount of time applicable personnel work on the development project Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred Major replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives All acquired real estate assets are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly the results of operations are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition The purchase price is allocated to i tangible assets consisting of land buildings and improvements as if vacant and tenant improvements and ii identifiable intangible assets and liabilities generally consisting of above and below market leases and in place leases We use estimates of fair value based on estimated cash flows using appropriate discount rates and other valuation methods to allocate the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets Liabilities assumed generally consist of mortgage debt on the real estate assets acquired Assumed debt with a stated interest rate that is significantly different from market interest rates is recorded at its fair value based on estimated market interest rates at the date of acquisition Depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years for buildings to years for certain improvements and to years for equipment and fixtures Tenant improvements are capitalized and depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease Lease related intangibles from acquisitions of real estate assets are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases The amortization of above and below market leases is recorded as an adjustment to minimum rental revenue while the amortization of all other lease related intangibles is recorded as amortization expense Any difference between the face value of the debt assumed and its fair value is amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt using the effective interest method Carrying Value of Long Lived Assets We periodically evaluate long lived assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and record impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts or if there are other indicators of impairment If it is determined that impairment has occurred the amount of the impairment charge is equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value We estimate fair value using the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by each Property which are based on a number of assumptions such as leasing expectations operating budgets estimated useful lives future maintenance expenditures intent to hold for use and capitalization rates among others These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including but not limited to demand for space competition for tenants changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each Property As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions the future cash flows estimated in our impairment analyses may not be achieved As described in Note to the consolidated financial statements we recorded impairment charges of million million and million in and respectively Table of Contents Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We periodically perform a detailed review of amounts due from tenants to determine if accounts receivable balances are impaired based on factors affecting the collectibility of those balances Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment about the timing frequency and severity of collection losses which affects the allowance and net income We recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million million and million for the years ended December and respectively Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We evaluate our joint venture arrangements to determine whether they should be recorded on a consolidated basis The percentage of ownership interest in the joint venture an evaluation of control and whether a variable interest entity VIE exists are all considered in the consolidation assessment Initial investments in joint ventures that are in economic substance a capital contribution to the joint venture are recorded in an amount equal to our historical carryover basis in the real estate contributed Initial investments in joint ventures that are in economic substance the sale of a portion of our interest in the real estate are accounted for as a contribution of real estate recorded in an amount equal to our historical carryover basis in the ownership percentage retained and as a sale of real estate with profit recognized to the extent of the other joint venturers interests in the joint venture Profit recognition assumes that we have no commitment to reinvest with respect to the percentage of the real estate sold and the accounting requirements of the full accrual method are met We account for our investment in joint ventures where we own a non controlling interest or where we are not the primary beneficiary of a VIE using the equity method of accounting Under the equity method our cost of investment is adjusted for our share of equity in the earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate and reduced by distributions received Generally distributions of cash flows from operations and capital events are first made to partners to pay cumulative unpaid preferences on unreturned capital balances and then to the partners in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreements Any differences between the cost of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate and our underlying equity as reflected in the unconsolidated affiliate s financial statements generally result from costs of our investment that are not reflected on the unconsolidated affiliate s financial statements capitalized interest on our investment and our share of development and leasing fees that are paid by the unconsolidated affiliate to us for development and leasing services provided to the unconsolidated affiliate during any development periods The net difference between our investment in unconsolidated affiliates and the underlying equity of unconsolidated affiliates is generally amortized over a period of years On a periodic basis we assess whether there are any indicators that the fair value of our investments in unconsolidated affiliates may be impaired An investment is impaired only if our estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary To the extent impairment has occurred the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment Our estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions such as future leasing expectations operating forecasts discount rates and capitalization rates among others These assumptions are subject to economic and market uncertainties including but not limited to demand for space competition for tenants changes in market rental rates and operating costs As these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions the fair values estimated in the impairment analyses may not be realized During the year ended December we incurred losses on impairments of investments totaling million We recorded a non cash charge of million in the first quarter of on our cost method investment in Jinsheng an established mall operating and real estate development company located in Nanjing China due to a decline in expected future cash flows The projected decrease was a result of declining occupancy and sales due to the then downturn of the real estate market in China in early We also recorded impairment charges totaling million related to our interest in Plaza Macaé in Macaé Brazil to reflect the fair value of the investment upon sale No impairments of investments in unconsolidated affiliates were incurred during and Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Guidance Adopted In January the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ASU ASU provides that significant transfers in or out of measurements classified as Levels or should be disclosed separately along with reasons for the transfers Information regarding purchases sales issuances and settlements related to measurements classified as Level are also to be presented separately The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December excluding the provision relating to the rollforward of Level activity which was effective for interim Table of Contents and annual periods beginning after December We adopted the provisions of this guidance on January except for the requirement related to Level measurements which we adopted January The adoption of the remaining disclosure requirements of ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements In July the FASB issued ASU No Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses ASU ASU requires entities to provide extensive new disclosures in their financial statements about their financing receivables including credit risk exposures and the allowance for credit losses The new disclosures include information regarding credit quality impaired or modified receivables non accrual or past due receivables and activity related to modified receivables and the allowance for credit losses The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December with the exception of the activity disclosures which were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December In January the FASB issued ASU No Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No ASU ASU delayed immediately the effective date for disclosures prescribed by ASU that relate to troubled debt restructurings The adoption of the non deferred disclosures prescribed by ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements In April the FASB issued ASU No A Creditor s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring ASU ASU provides additional guidance to assist creditors in determining whether a restructuring of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring A provision in ASU also ends the FASB s deferral of the additional disclosures about troubled debt restructurings as required by ASU which had previously been deferred by ASU For public entities the guidance was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June and should be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption As a result of applying this guidance an entity may identify receivables that are newly considered impaired For purposes of measuring impairment of those receivables an entity should apply the amendments prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective In May the FASB issued ASU No Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U S GAAP and IFRSs ASU The objective of ASU is to align fair value measurements and related disclosure requirements under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs thus improving the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U S GAAP and IFRSs For public entities this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December and should be applied prospectively The adoption of ASU will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements In June the FASB issued ASU No Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU The objective of this accounting update is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity ASU requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but continuous statements of net income and other comprehensive income For public entities this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December and should be applied retrospectively In December the FASB issued ASU Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No ASU This guidance defers the changes in ASU that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income Other requirements of ASU are not affected by ASU The guidance in ASU is effective at the same time as ASU so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentation requirements in ASU that ASU is deferring While the adoption of ASU will change the presentation format of our consolidated financial statements it will not have an impact on the amounts reported in those statements In December the FASB issued ASU No Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate a Scope Clarification ASU This guidance applies to the derecognition of in substance real estate when the parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate because of a default by the subsidiary on its nonrecourse debt Under ASU the reporting entity should apply the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification ASC Property Plant and Equipment Real Estate Sales to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate Generally the requirements to derecognize in substance real estate would not be met before the legal transfer of the real estate to the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse indebtedness Thus even if the reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest under ASC Consolidation Overall it would continue to include the real estate debt and the results of the subsidiary s operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title to the real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the debt ASU should be applied on a prospective basis to deconsolidation events occurring after the Table of Contents effective date For public companies this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after June Early adoption is permitted We are currently assessing the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements Impact of Inflation and Deflation Deflation can result in a decline in general price levels often caused by a decrease in the supply of money or credit The predominant effects of deflation are high unemployment credit contraction and weakened consumer demand Restricted lending practices could impact our ability to obtain financings or refinancings for our properties and our tenants ability to obtain credit Decreases in consumer demand can have a direct impact on our tenants and the rents we receive During inflationary periods substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the impact of inflation These provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales which generally increase as prices rise and or escalation clauses which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases In addition many of the leases are for terms of less than years which may provide us the opportunity to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base and or percentage rent if rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate Most of the leases require the tenants to pay a fixed amount subject to annual increases for their share of operating expenses including common area maintenance real estate taxes insurance and certain capital expenditures which reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation Funds From Operations Funds From Operations FFO is a widely used measure of the operating performance of real estate companies that supplements net income loss determined in accordance with GAAP The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT defines FFO as net income loss computed in accordance with GAAP excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures and noncontrolling interests are calculated on the same basis In October NAREIT clarified that FFO should exclude the impact of losses on impairment of depreciable properties The Company has calculated FFO for all periods presented in accordance with this clarification We define FFO allocable to common shareholders as defined above by NAREIT less dividends on preferred stock Our method of calculating FFO allocable to common shareholders may be different from methods used by other REITs and accordingly may not be comparable to such other REITs We believe that FFO provides an additional indicator of the operating performance of our Properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization which assumes the value of real estate assets declines predictably over time Since values of well maintained real estate assets have historically risen with market conditions we believe that FFO enhances investors understanding of our operating performance The use of FFO as an indicator of financial performance is influenced not only by the operations of our Properties and interest rates but also by our capital structure We present both FFO of our Operating Partnership and FFO allocable to common shareholders as we believe that both are useful performance measures We believe FFO of our Operating Partnership is a useful performance measure since we conduct substantially all of our business through our Operating Partnership and therefore it reflects the performance of the Properties in absolute terms regardless of the ratio of ownership interests of our common shareholders and the noncontrolling interest in our Operating Partnership We believe FFO allocable to common shareholders is a useful performance measure because it is the performance measure that is most directly comparable to net income loss attributable to common shareholders In our reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common shareholders to FFO allocable to common shareholders that is presented below we make an adjustment to add back noncontrolling interest in income loss of our Operating Partnership in order to arrive at FFO of our Operating Partnership We then apply a percentage to FFO of our Operating Partnership to arrive at FFO allocable to common shareholders The percentage is computed by taking the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and dividing it by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and the weighted average number of Operating Partnership units outstanding during the period FFO does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss for purposes of evaluating our operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity During we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations Considering the significance and nature of this item we believe that it is important to identify the impact of the change on our FFO measures for a reader to have a complete understanding of our results of operations Therefore we have also presented FFO excluding this item Table of Contents FFO of the Operating Partnership increased to million for the year ended December compared to million for the prior year FFO in was positively impacted by the gain on extinguishment of million The reconciliation of FFO to net income loss attributable to common shareholders is as follows in thousands Year Ended December Net income loss attributable to common shareholders Noncontrolling interest in income of operating partnership Depreciation and amortization expense of Consolidated properties Unconsolidated affiliates Discontinued operations Non real estate assets Noncontrolling interests share of depreciation and amortization Loss on impairment of real estate net of tax benefit Gain on depreciable property Gain loss on discontinued operations Funds from operations of the operating partnership Gain on extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations Funds from operations of the operating partnership as adjusted The reconciliations of FFO of the operating partnership to FFO allocable to Company shareholders including and excluding the gain on extinguishment of debt from discontinued operations are as follows in thousands Year Ended December Funds from operations of the operating partnership Percentage allocable to common shareholders Funds from operations allocable to common shareholders Funds from operations of the operating partnership as adjusted Percentage allocable to common shareholders Funds from operations allocable to Company shareholders as adjusted Represents the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period divided by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and the weighted average number of operating partnership units outstanding during the period We are exposed to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk The following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties Estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in interest and foreign exchange rates Caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below as actual results may differ We employ various derivative programs to manage certain portions of our market risk associated with interest rates See Note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk regarding derivative financial instrument activity Interest Rate Risk Based on our proportionate share of consolidated and unconsolidated variable rate debt at December a increase or decrease in interest rates on variable rate debt would decrease or increase annual cash flows by approximately million and million respectively and annual interest expense after the effect of capitalized interest by approximately and million respectively Based on our proportionate share of total consolidated and unconsolidated debt at December a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately million while a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately million Table of Contents ]]></c>

see Risk Factors in Item A of this report on Form K Overview We are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units Our subsidiary Merit Enterprises is a general contractor that acts as our in house construction division and provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties On October we announced our intention to exit the third party construction services business We have since substantially completed performance under all of our remaining third party construction services contracts We intend to continue to provide general contracting and construction services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate During the year ended December our two primary sources of cash and revenue from operations were rents from the leasing of owned apartment units which represented of our consolidated revenue and construction services which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year The operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic trends including but not limited to factors such as household formation job growth unemployment rates population growth immigration the supply of new multifamily rental communities and in certain markets the supply of other housing alternatives such as condominiums single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes Additionally our performance may be affected by the access to and cost of debt and equity Rental revenue collections are impacted by rental rates occupancy levels and rent concessions We adjust our rental rates and concessions in our continuing efforts to adapt to changing market conditions and maximize rental revenue We continuously monitor physical occupancy and net collected rent per unit to track our success in maximizing rental revenue These indicators are more fully described in the Results of Operations comparison Additionally we consider property NOI and FFO to be important indicators of our overall performance Property NOI property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties and has the largest impact on our financial condition and operating results FFO is used by real estate investment trusts as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of real estate companies because it excludes charges such as real estate depreciation that are generally considered not to be reflective of the actual value of real estate assets over time Additionally gains and losses from the sale of most real estate assets and certain other items are also excluded from FFO See Selected Financial Data presented in Part II Item of this report on Form K for reconciliations of property NOI and FFO to consolidated net income loss income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP Our Same Community portfolio for the years and consists of properties containing units and accounted for of total revenue in and of our property NOI Our Same Community portfolio includes properties that we have owned and operated for the entire two year period ending December Same Community NOI increased in compared to primarily as a result of a million or increase in NOI from our Midwest Ohio Michigan and Indiana portfolio Our Mid Atlantic Maryland Metro DC and Virginia portfolio NOI increased or and our Southeast Georgia and Florida portfolio NOI increased or in The following table presents property NOI results for and Year Ended December In thousands Property NOI Property NOI Same Community Properties Midwest Mid Atlantic Southeast Total Same Community Acquired Properties Development Total Property NOI Our earnings guidance anticipates the acquisition of approximately zero to million of properties and the disposition of approximately million to million of properties Additionally our development spend is expected to be approximately million and includes the completion of our Nashville development and the commencement of construction on two sites in Dallas As of December we have incurred million of costs in connection with the development of Vista Germantown in Nashville Tennessee and anticipate that an additional million of expenditures will be incurred to complete the construction We anticipate that construction should be completed during the second quarter of We intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions and development opportunities when our investment criteria are met We also may sell properties where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide over time a significantly greater return on equity an increase in cash flow or further enhance our strategic objectives We will continue to focus on the ratio of our total debt to gross real estate assets which was at December compared with at December We will also continue to focus on the reduction of our overall weighted average interest rate on our borrowings which improved to at December compared with at December and our fixed charge coverage ratio which improved to times at December from times at December In order to maximize property NOI we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level both regionally and portfolio wide In at the midpoint of our guidance we expect Same Community NOI to increase driven by a increase in property revenue and a increase in property operating expenses compared to The increase in revenue will primarily be due to maintaining physical occupancy levels and from increased rental rates However the uncertainties caused by economic and financial conditions complicate our ability to forecast future performance We believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather a continuing recessionary environment or delayed recovery than other real estate sectors because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays and because government sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to provide attractive apartment financing which may be unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors However our expectations may be adversely impacted if recessionary forces resume or if Congress curtails Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac financing support to the apartment industry Moreover unless and until real job growth occurs in our markets significant rental growth may be limited Federal Income Taxes We have elected to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust REIT under Sections through of the Internal Revenue Code of as amended commencing with our taxable year ending December REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders Providing we continue to qualify as a REIT we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income A REIT is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another REIT and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer As an exception to this prohibition a REIT is allowed to own up to of the securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS that can provide non customary services to REIT tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a REIT receives from its tenants However no more than of the value of a REIT s total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRS The amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a TRS and a REIT are subject to arms length allocations LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows and Liquidity Significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows Significant Cash Sources Uses Year Ended December In thousands Net cash provided by operations Fixed assets Acquisitions and development expenditures net Net property disposition proceeds Recurring revenue enhancing and non recurring capital expenditures Debt Increase decrease in mortgage notes Decrease increase in revolving credit facility borrowings Increase in term loan borrowings Redemption of trust preferred securities Exercise of stock options Common share issuances Preferred share redemption Cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid Purchase of treasury shares Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations short term borrowings on the unsecured revolver project specific loans and the sale of debt or equity securities Our debt repayment obligations are relatively modest On January we prepaid two loans totaling million that included prepayment penalties totaling million Both of these loans were scheduled to mature in We funded this prepayment from borrowings on our million unsecured revolving credit facility As of the filing date we had five additional loans totaling million maturing in We intend to prepay at par three of the loans totaling million on March and prepay at par the remaining two loans totaling million on or before July from borrowings on our unsecured revolver and or other secured or unsecured financings or proceeds of the sale of common shares In January we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that among other things increased the maximum amount of borrowings under the revolver to million extended the maturity date to January and provided for a one year extension option Additionally the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for an increase of the total facility to million upon request and agreement of the lenders participating in the facility Our borrowing capacity under the revolver is a function of our unencumbered property pool As of February the maximum amount of borrowings available to us under the revolver was million and borrowings outstanding totaled million On June we closed on a million unsecured five year term loan This loan currently has a variable interest rate which was at December and matures June Proceeds from the term loan were used to pay down borrowings outstanding on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes On December we entered into a forward starting swap effective June which fixes the rate on the term loan until maturity at a rate of plus the credit spread which is currently or an all in rate of based upon the credit spread applicable under the term loan as of February which is subject to change dependent upon our leverage ratio Our ability to access the capital markets affords us additional liquidity as demonstrated by our sale of of our common shares in in three separate underwritten offers to the public markets The net proceeds from these offerings which totaled approximately million were used to repay maturing debt redeem all of our outstanding Class B Series II Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares redeem all of our Trust Preferred Securities partially pay for three newly acquired operating properties acquire the land for our Germantown Nashville Tennessee development to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes Additionally during we sold common shares under our continuous at the market ATM offering program which generated proceeds of million net of sales commissions and other costs The proceeds were used to reduce borrowings on our unsecured revolver and for general corporate purposes Cash flow provided by operations increased million when comparing to The increase was primarily due to an increase in property NOI as a result of the addition during of four properties the completion of a unit expansion at one of our existing properties and the acquisition during of three additional properties Cash flow provided by operations increased slightly when comparing to The increase was primarily due to the increase in construction receivables net of the increase in construction payables and the increase in share based compensation The increase in construction activity was due to our subsidiary Merit Enterprises commencing several third party construction projects during Merit records its revenues and related expenses based on the percentage of completion method and as such records receivables and payables as part of the estimate of the amounts completed Shelf Availability We have a shelf registration statement that relates to possible offerings from time to time of debt securities including convertible debt preferred shares depositary shares common shares and common share warrants This registration statement was for million and expires in June Securities and or debt offerings up to million are currently available under this shelf registration statement Additionally effective August we registered an ATM program where we can sell up to million of our common shares in open market transactions at the then market price per share During we sold common shares under this program for total gross proceeds of million or million net of sales commissions and other costs leaving million available under this program Liquidity Normal Business Operations We anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations We believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections other sources such as the unsecured revolver secured and unsecured borrowings are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements Liquidity Non Operational Activities Sources of cash available for repayment of debt any property acquisitions and funding other capital expenditures are expected to be provided primarily by proceeds from the refinancing of debt borrowings our unsecured revolver the sale of properties and possibly the sale of common shares We anticipate financing the estimated million balance of the construction costs for our unit Germantown Nashville Tennessee development through borrowings remaining available under the construction loan we have arranged for that project Additionally we anticipate that the development of the unit expansion of San Raphael Apartments will be financed from our unsecured revolver Also we anticipate that the development of our planned Dwell Turtle Creek apartment community in Dallas will be financed by a construction loan and funding from our unsecured revolver Long Term Contractual Obligations The

with the dividend scheduled to be paid in May we have increased the quarterly dividend to per share from per share In conjunction with revising the Company s dividend policy the Board of Directors evaluated the Company s past performance and future prospects for earnings growth Additional factors considered in determining the increase included current dividend distributions the ratio of the

shares or cash at our discretion at a price per OP unit equal to the average closing price of our common shares for the day period preceding a limited partner s redemption notice As of December there were OP units remaining having a carrying value of million and of the original OP units had been redeemed These transactions had the effect of increasing our interest in the DownREIT Partnership from to For additional information regarding the OP units see Note of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II Item of this report on Form K Development Partnership On September we entered into a partnership agreement with Bristol Development Group an unrelated third party for the development of Vista Germantown a unit apartment community located in downtown Nashville Tennessee We contributed million to the partnership and hold a equity interest We have determined that this entity is not a variable interest entity and that we hold a controlling financial interest in the entity As such this entity is included in our consolidated financial statements We have also determined that the non controlling interest in this entity meets the criterion to be classified as a component of permanent equity The partnership has engaged Merit Enterprises to act as general contractor in the construction of this property Construction commenced during the fourth quarter of and is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of We have arranged for a million construction loan and have guaranteed the partnership s repayment of the loan As of December borrowings totaling million have been made from this loan Acquisition and Development Activities During we acquired three properties for a total purchase price of approximately million which includes a million Fannie Mae loan that we assumed For additional information regarding the assumed loan see Note of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II Item of this report on Form K During we acquired four properties for a total purchase price of approximately million and during the second quarter of we completed the construction of a unit expansion of our existing unit River Forest apartment community located in the Richmond Virginia metropolitan market area Total cost of this development was approximately million which included of capitalized interest and of capitalized payroll costs We intend to continue to evaluate land and property acquisitions Any future acquisitions or developments would be financed with the most appropriate sources of capital which may include the assumption of mortgage indebtedness bank and other institutional borrowings the exchange of properties undistributed earnings secured or unsecured debt financings or the issuance of shares or units exchangeable into common shares Dispositions During we sold two properties for net cash proceeds of approximately million The operating results of these properties along with the gains of million that we recognized are included in Income from discontinued operations General Contractor Construction Our subsidiary Merit Enterprises is engaged as a general contractor and construction manager which acts as our in house construction division as well as provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties During and Merit worked on ten projects for third parties In we decided to exit the third party construction services business and we have substantially completed our work under all third party construction contracts We intend to continue to provide general contracting and construction services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate Additionally Merit completed the rehabilitation of one of our properties in and is currently completing construction of a unit property for a partnership in which we are a partner as previously described In the following discussion of the comparison of the year ended December to the year ended December and the year ended December to the year ended December Same Community properties represent wholly owned properties that were owned during all of and Acquired Development properties represent three properties acquired in four properties acquired in and a unit expansion of a Virginia property which was completed in June The net

Community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents potential rent less concessions The majority of the improvement was in the Midwest portfolio Property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the acquired and development properties Property revenue for the Same Community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents and a decline in the amount of vacancy losses The majority of the improvement was in the Southeast portfolio Fees Reimbursements and Other The management and service company revenues fees reimbursements and others declined when comparing to Effective during we terminated our remaining property and asset management contracts and exited the third party management business Therefore we will no longer be reporting management fee revenue Property Operating and Maintenance Expenses Property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to This increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses for the acquired and development properties increasing million when comparing the two years Property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to This increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses of million for the properties acquired or developed in Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased million when comparing to This increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties The intangible assets consisting primarily of relationships with residents under month leases are being amortized over a month period Depreciation and amortization expenses increased million when comparing to This increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquired and development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties The intangible assets are being amortized over a to month period Direct Property Management and Service Company Expenses Direct property management and service company expenses decreased in compared to due to our terminating all property and asset management contracts and exiting the third party management business as referenced above Construction and Other Services Our subsidiary Merit Enterprises is engaged as a general contractor and construction manager that acts as our in house construction division as well as provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties During and Merit worked on ten projects for third parties In we decided to exit the third party construction services business and we have substantially completed our work under all third party construction contracts We intend to continue to provide general contracting and construction services for our own account in connection with the development of multifamily properties we will own and operate Revenues for were in line with revenues earned in while expenses increased by approximately million primarily as a result of additional construction costs incurred for certain rehabilitation projects subject to guaranteed maximum price contracts The revenue and expenses shown for represent construction services for third parties while the revenue and expenses shown for were from third party painting services that Merit provided at that time but has since ceased providing General and Administrative Expenses There were no significant variances when comparing to General and administrative expenses increased million when comparing to This increase was primarily due to an increase in adjustments to various payroll and incentive compensation accruals including a one time charge of approximately related to the resignation of our former Vice President and General Counsel net of a decline in directors deferred compensation expense Prior to January the fair value of the directors deferred compensation was adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period Effective January this plan was modified to provide that all distributions under the plan will be in the form of our common shares instead of cash As a result the fair value of the deferred compensation is no longer adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares Interest Expense Interest expense increased million when comparing to The increase was primarily due to the net of the following Interest on mortgage loans secured by Same Community properties declined million due to the prepayment of seven loans in totaling million and five loans in totaling million Interest expense on mortgage loans secured by acquired properties increased million due to the addition of two loans totaling million in and a million loan in Additionally interest expense in connection with our unsecured revolver and unsecured term loan increased million due to increased borrowings on the unsecured revolver throughout when compared to and the closing of the unsecured term loan in June Furthermore our weighted average interest rate declined to at December Interest expense decreased million when comparing to The decrease was primarily due to mortgage loan interest expense declining million due to a reduction in mortgage loans of million during Additionally on June we redeemed all of our Trust Preferred Securities which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million In connection with the original issuance of the Trust Preferred Securities we incurred issuance costs that were recorded as other assets and subsequently charged to interest expense each period over the life of the securities We recognized the remaining balance of of issuance costs as a one time non cash charge to interest expense in Furthermore the average interest rate dropped to at December from at December Income from Discontinued Operations Included in discontinued operations for the years ended December and are the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in Also included in is a gain on insurance recoveries which resulted from the settlement of wind storm damage at one of the properties sold in for the aggregate sum of which is net of our deductible Included in discontinued operations for the year ended December are the operating results of the two properties sold in and the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in For further details on Income from discontinued operations see Note of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II Item of this report on Form K Preferred Share Repurchase Costs On June we redeemed all of our Class B Series II Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares at a cost of approximately million plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date In connection with the issuance of the Class B Preferred Shares in December we incurred approximately million in issuance costs and recorded such costs as a reduction to shareholders equity We recognized the million of issuance costs as a reduction in net earnings in computing our net loss applicable to common shares for the year ended December Inflation We believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impact our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms which allow us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases We are careful to account for inflationary factors that may impact our development projects however there can be no assurance that inflation will not result in development costs exceeding original estimates in future periods See Item A Risk Factors Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries our two taxable REIT subsidiaries the Operating Partnership structured as a DownREIT that owns one of our operating properties in Florida and the partnership in which we are a partner that owns our development property in Nashville Tennessee The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes In preparing these consolidated financial statements we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements giving due consideration to materiality It is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize As a result actual results could differ from these estimates In addition other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of other companies in similar businesses The Company has identified five critical accounting policies These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates With respect to these critical accounting policies management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented The five critical accounting policies are Construction Services We account for general contracting and construction management services that we provide to third parties using the percentage completion method Under this method the amount of revenue and expense to be recognized for each project that we are engaged in at the end of each reporting period is estimated based on the percentage of work completed on that date The use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining the percentage of work completed the expected total cost of a project in process and in certain circumstances the total amount of revenue for a project in process If we had used different estimates different amounts would have been recognized in revenue and expense which may have resulted in a material impact to our results of operations If actual costs or revenue differ from estimates it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations Because we are exiting the third party construction services business and have substantially completed all third party construction contracts at December our construction services accounting policy will no longer be a critical accounting policy for and future years Impairment of Long Lived Assets Our held for investment real estate assets are assessed for impairment if current events or circumstances such as significant adverse changes in general market conditions decreases in property net operating income or reductions in expected future cash flows indicate that the carrying value cost less accumulated depreciation may not be recoverable Factors we consider in evaluating impairment of real estate assets held for investment include estimated future growth rates capitalization rates occupancy assumptions current expectations regarding the holding period for the individual assets and external data to the extent available Should the estimates used change impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations We review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator In performing this analysis we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider Should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations Share Based Compensation We estimate the fair value of share based compensation awarded We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options and the Monte Carlo method to estimate the fair value of restricted share awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions The use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models such as volatility of share prices and forfeitures of awards If we had used different judgment and or estimates different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations We also estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards If the results vary from our estimate it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations Real Estate Taxes We estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments In most circumstances the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and consequently these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded Acquisitions of Investment Properties We allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price we utilize a number of sources including analysis provided by an advisor independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data We amortize intangible assets over months and had we determined different estimates it could have resulted in the recognition of different expense amounts CONTINGENCIES Environmental We have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations AROs and have determined that we do not have any material AROs that would require recognition as a liability or disclosure in our financial statements at December Phase I environmental audits were obtained at the time of the our initial public offering in property acquisition and or property refinancing as applicable on all of our wholly owned properties Future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and if so whether any claims will in fact be asserted Pending Litigation For a discussion of pending litigation see Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II Item of this report on Form K Interest Rate Risk Based on our variable rate debt outstanding at December and an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense by approximately million and million respectively on an annual basis Additionally we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity We have managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a prudent ratio of fixed rate long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions We use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives For additional information relating to interest rate hedge agreements see Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part II Item of this

instruments and related consumables We have three instrument systems GeneTitan GeneChip and GeneAtlas that include instruments consumables and software Our GeneChip instruments run arrays packaged in cartridges and our GeneTitan and GeneAtlas TM instruments run arrays packaged in a peg format We also offer a variety of assays for gene expression targeting low to mid plex markets that are downstream of our whole genome arrays and a range of reagent kits that are compatible with our platforms as well as the products of other vendors Overview of Fiscal Year and Strategic Initiatives In our business was affected by a significant drop in the volume of sales of consumables to our academic and pharmaceutical customers particularly in North America which led to a decrease in revenue as compared to the same period in Primarily due to lower revenues from product sales we incurred a net loss of million for the year Despite the lower revenues we were able to generate cash flows from operations of almost million in Our focus remains on carrying out the following strategic initiatives Entering new markets and expanding our product lines Our goal continues to be to expand our revenue base by entering new markets growing our customer base and successfully commercializing our established and acquired technologies In the future we intend to continue to expand our focus to include the validation and routine testing markets which we believe offer attractive compound annual growth rates and opportunities for more recurring revenue growth in the future We seek to expand our product line with new products that combine automated instrumentation powerful new biological assays and new array designs and content Table of Contents Improving operating leverage We remain focused on improving our operating leverage and were successful in lowering our operating expenses in as compared to Profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to increasing top line revenue and sustained operating leverage CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies However certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the financial statements Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements REVENUE RECOGNITION We enter into contracts to sell our products and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions As a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements when and how to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized INVENTORIES We enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products The business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand We perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period which includes a review of among other factors demand requirements product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing product expiration and quality issues Based on this analysis we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods when appropriate in order to report inventory at net realizable value These inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand component costs supplier arrangements or product life cycles differ from our estimates Any such adjustments would result in a charge to our results of operations NON MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES As part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies These investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost We also invest in a limited partnership investment fund that is accounted for under the equity method We periodically review our investments for impairment however the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment The analysis may include assessment of the investee s i revenue and earnings trend ii business outlook for its products and technologies iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired We have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non marketable investments over the past few years Table of Contents INCOME TAXES Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income Under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse We must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations We believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in overall levels character or geographical mix of pretax earnings changes in tax laws regulations and or rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities future levels of research and development spending nondeductible expenses applicability of tax holidays and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December was approximately million If recognized the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is million As of December we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months We classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense For the year ended December the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately million for a total cumulative amount of million of non current income taxes payable as of December We file U S federal state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations During November the U S Internal Revenue Service completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the and tax years and issued a Revenue Agent s Report or RAR with no proposed adjustments We consider all tax positions taken in the and tax years to be effectively settled because the U S Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote possibility that the U S Internal Revenue Service will re examine the settled positions As a result we have released reserves of approximately million related to uncertain tax positions for those periods and recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets However the federal and California statute of limitations on assessment still remain open for the tax years through In significant foreign jurisdictions the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities CONTINGENCIES We are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters Based on the information available at the balance sheet dates we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses If losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a reserve which may change in the future due to new developments in each matter ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED COMPENSATION We account for employee share based compensation by estimating the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions The most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock We determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends As required under the accounting rules we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and as a result we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee share based awards granted in future periods Table of Contents US GAAP requires that employee share based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period or the vesting period in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees Accordingly in we recognized employee share based compensation of million which consisted of million in cost of product sales million in research and development expense and million in selling general and administrative expenses As of December million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested employee stock awards is expected to be recognized as future cost of sales and operating expenses over a weighted average period of years The following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December and PRODUCT SALES The components of product sales are as follows Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Consumables Instruments Total product sales Total product sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to volume decreases Chip volumes shipped were lower across all products while overall average selling price remained flat Reagent revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume Genechip shipments combined with lower average selling price caused by a shift in product mix Instruments were lower due to fewer GeneTitan sales partially offset by increased sales of the lower priced GeneAtlas Total product sales decreased million or in as compared to Consumables sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in the sales of our RNA reagents partially offset by an increase in sales of our DNA reagents In both areas sales of our lower price products have increased as a percentage of the total mix Instrument sales grew in as compared to primarily due to the increased adoption of GeneTitan and introduction of GeneAtlas TM families of instruments which were introduced in late and early respectively partially offset by declines in the volume of sales of older instruments SERVICES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Services Total services revenue remained consistent in as compared to which was in line with our expectations Total services revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to the completion in late of several genotyping projects that began in the fourth quarter of including the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and the National Institutes of Health projects Table of Contents ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Royalties and other revenue Royalties and other revenue in was higher as compared to and primarily due to the receipt of a non recurring million license payment that was received in the fourth quarter of In addition to the non recurring license payment royalties and other revenue was lower in as compared to due to lower royalties and research activity PRODUCT AND SERVICES GROSS MARGINS Dollars in thousands Dollar Point Year ended December change from Total gross margin on product sales Total gross margin on services Product gross margin as a percentage of product sales Service gross margin as a percentage of services Despite lower product sales in product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased during the year as compared to primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products along with lower material warranty and excess and obsolescence costs in as well as plant consolidation costs that occurred in These cost improvements were partially offset by lower cost absorption due to higher production levels in We note a downward trend in product gross margin within when comparing quarterly results driven by increased absorption cost due to lower sales Product gross margin increased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in plant consolidation costs from million in to million in as the majority of the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure took place in Additionally favorable pricing and absorption in chips contributed to the increased product margin These increases were partially offset by higher excess and obsolescence costs for products with finite lives Service gross margin increased in as compared to primarily due to costs associated with the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure that was completed in the second quarter of Service gross margin was lower in as compared to primarily as a result of the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and National Institutes of Health projects which had higher margins and were completed in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Research and development expenses decreased in and as compared to primarily due to savings in head count related expenses and variable compensation of million and million respectively and decreased spending on supplies of million and million respectively as a result of cost control measures This was partially offset by an increase in facilities expenses primarily due to a one time expense of million related to the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara during the third quarter of Table of Contents SELLING GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Selling general and administrative Selling general and administrative expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower legal expenses of million as a result of a litigation settlement at the end of Other cost savings include variable compensation adjustments of million lower spending on consulting and other services of million and advertising expenses of million These savings were partially offset by one time severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer of million rent expense of million primarily due to the acceleration of future lease payments as a result of the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara and acquisition costs of million incurred on the anticipated eBioscience transaction In selling general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses of million as a result of lower headcount and decreased variable compensation Additionally legal expenses decreased by million primarily due to timing of legal proceedings with third parties consulting and purchased services decreased by million as a result of various general and administrative cost reductions and rent expense decreased by million due primarily to the relocation of our Japan office and other site consolidation efforts INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER NET The components of interest income and other net are as follows Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Interest income Realized loss on equity investments net Currency loss net Other Total interest income and other net Interest income and other net decreased in as compared to due to the following Realized loss on equity investments decreased in as compared to as we recognized fewer other than temporary impairments OTTI In we recognized million in OTTI on our non marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund a non marketable investment in a private biotechnology company and an investment classified as available for sale in a publicly traded company In we recognized million in OTTI on two non marketable investments Currency loss net increased primarily due to the weakening of the U S dollar against the Euro in as compared to and Other changed in due to a million provision against a note receivable from a private biotechnology company and a million impairment charge recorded against our West Sacramento facility during Table of Contents Interest income and other net changed by million in as compared to due to the following Interest income decreased by million in as compared to due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the repurchase of a portion of our convertible notes during partially offset by higher effective interest rates in Realized loss in equity investments increased by million in as we recognized million of other than temporary impairment expense largely as a result of our recognition of impairment charges on two non marketable investments This was partially offset by a net realized gain from our investment in a limited partnership investment fund of million In we recognized a net realized loss of million primarily due to OTTI on our non marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund Currency loss decreased in by million due to favorable currency movements in and Other income decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring sale of equipment in totaling million INTEREST EXPENSE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Interest expense Interest expense decreased in as compared to and primarily due to a lower aggregate principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of our repurchases totaling million in aggregate principal amount during There were no further purchases in INCOME TAX PROVISION BENEFIT Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Income tax provision benefit The income tax provision was approximately million and million in and respectively which consisted primarily of foreign taxes The income tax benefit in of million consisted of foreign taxes similar to and offset by refundable U S credits Deferred tax assets are recognized if realization of such assets is more likely than not As of December we provided for a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets As a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position we have placed a full valuation allowance on U S and certain foreign deferred tax assets We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income As of December we had total net operating loss carryforwards of million comprised of million for U S federal purposes which expire in the years through if not utilized and million for state purposes the majority of which expire in the years through if not utilized Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization During due to potential future transactions that would require cash outflows we changed our assertion such that foreign earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested As a result we recorded a net deferred tax liability of approximately million related to the foreign undistributed earnings which was offset by a reduction in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Historically we have financed our operations primarily through product sales sales of equity and debt securities such as our convertible notes in collaborative agreements interest income licensing of our technology and when necessary financing arrangements with third party creditors Our cash outflows have generally been as follows cash used in operating activities such as research and development programs sales and marketing activity compensation and benefits of our employees and other working capital needs cash paid for acquisitions cash paid for litigation activity and settlements and cash used for our debt repurchases and repurchases of our convertible notes as well as interest payments on our convertible notes obligations As of December we had cash cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million We anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations debt repayments or repurchases and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future These expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans which are subject to change and therefore we could require further funding Factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include but are not limited to financing arrangements that we may enter into in connection with our acquisition of eBioscience or future acquisitions a decline in cash generated by sales of our products and services our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements the progress of our research and development programs initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations the costs involved in preparing filing prosecuting defending and enforcing intellectual property rights the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements the purchase of patent licenses and other factors On November we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire eBioscience for approximately million in cash subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement The merger is subject to customary closing conditions including our receipt of financing for the merger In connection with the Merger Agreement we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for million of senior secured credit The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied and as a result we will not be able to complete the eBioscience acquisition unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured We are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience regarding the possibility of restructuring the committed financing but no agreement or understandings have been reached We have waived eBioscience s obligations under the non solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement and we understand that eBioscience is considering alternatives to the merger The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing of the merger has not occurred by March so long as a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate has not been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date On December we received notice that Tang Capital Partners LP a holder of our Senior Convertible Notes Due the Notes had commenced class action litigation against us in the Superior Court of California County of Santa Clara The complaint alleged a variety of claims relating to our proposed acquisition of eBioscience including that the acquisition would constitute a Fundamental Change under the indenture governing the Notes The complaint sought unspecified damages temporary and permanent injunctive relief against completion of the eBioscience acquisition and other remedies On January we entered into an agreement to settle the purported class action litigation As part of the settlement we agreed to commence a tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes at par plus accrued interest Tang Capital Partners LP which owned approximately million principal amount of the Notes agreed to tender all of its Notes into the offer Table of Contents As of December we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital To the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms or at all To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders If adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms Our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations From time to time we may seek to retire repurchase or exchange convertible securities or common stock in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions liquidity and contractual obligations and other factors We did not retire repurchase or exchange any of our common stock or remaining outstanding convertible securities during the year ended December As noted above on February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Cashflow in thousands Year ended December Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by used in investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December was comprised of a net loss of million net of non cash charges of million and a million increase in working capital Adjustments for non cash expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of million a net realized loss on investments of million which included other than temporary impairment charges totaling million a provision against a notes receivable from a private biotechnology company of million an impairment charge on property and equipment of million and share based compensation expense of million Investing Activities We liquidated a number of investments during the fourth quarter of to fund the anticipated eBioscience acquisition that resulted in a net inflow from investing activities from the purchase sales and maturities of available for sale securities totaling million during Our investing activities further included capital expenditures of million and purchased technology rights of million in Financing Activities Our financing activities generally consist of stock option exercise activity under our employee stock plan Cash used in the issuance of stock under our employee stock plan net of treasury shares withheld for taxes was million for the year ended December Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December we had no off balance sheet arrangements The impact that our contractual obligations as of December are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands Total After Senior convertible notes Interest payments Operating leases Purchase commitments Total contractual obligations Our senior convertible notes are due in However holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on January and On February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Affymetrix and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million the timing of which is uncertain Refer to Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Income Taxes for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits In the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of Affymetrix Accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes Our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk To achieve this objective we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U S Government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers and by policy restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years Table of Contents Periods of Maturity Fair Value at Thereafter Total December ASSETS Available for sale securities Average interest rate LIABILITIES senior convertible notes due Average interest rate In the security holders of our senior convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest On February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Periods of Maturity Fair Value at Thereafter Total December ASSETS Available for sale securities Average interest rate LIABILITIES senior convertible notes due Average interest rate senior convertible notes due Average interest rate Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U S dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U S dollar or foreign currency exchange rates These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated Other Comprehensive Income OCI and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income net if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring Any gain or loss after a hedge is de designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income net immediately The following table summarizes the notional amounts weighted average currency exchange rates and fair values of our unsettled foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December We had no unsettled hedging contracts at December All contracts have maturities of months or less Weighted average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U S dollars per foreign currency Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December notional amounts and fair values in U S dollars and in thousands Weighted Average

Consolidated Backlog in thousands Piping Systems Filtration Products Industrial Process Cooling Corporate and Other Total net of order cancelled after January due to technical matters MFRI Inc is engaged in the manufacture and sale of products in three reportable segments piping systems filtration products and industrial process cooling Piping systems domestic sales and earnings are seasonal typically lower during the fourth and first quarters due to unfavorable weather for construction over much of North America and are correspondingly higher during the second and third quarters The Company website address is www mfri com The analysis presented below and discussed in more detail throughout the MD A was organized to provide instructive information for understanding the business going forward However this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in Item of this report including the notes thereto An overview of the segment results is provided in Note Business and segment information to the consolidated financial statements in Item of this report Critical accounting policies and estimates MD A discusses the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Management believes that judgments and estimates related to the following critical accounting policies could materially affect the consolidated financial statements Revenue recognition Percentage of completion revenue recognition Inventory Income taxes Equity based compensation Fair value of financial instruments In the fourth quarter of there were no changes in the above critical accounting policies In the latest recession the economy experienced a severe and prolonged downturn which adversely impacted all of the Company s businesses directly or indirectly Although improvement is expected the timing of economic recovery in the markets we serve remains uncertain Because economic and market conditions vary within the Company s segments the Company s future performance by segment will also vary Should current economic conditions continue or a further downturn in one or more of our significant markets the Company could experience a period of declining net sales which could adversely impact the Company s results of operations Correction of immaterial errors In the fourth quarter of management discovered prior period tax errors related mainly to transfer pricing The cumulative adjustment for the tax errors covering the period from February to January was approximately thousand The adjustment applicable to the fourth quarter of was approximately thousand and the adjustment applicable to prior years February January totaled approximately thousand Pursuant to the guidance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No Materiality the Company concluded that the errors were not material to any of its prior period financial statements However in accordance with SAB No Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements the prior period financial statements were revised Prior period amounts stated in this Form K have been revised to facilitate comparability between current and prior year periods For further information see Note Correction of immaterial errors in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Compared to Net sales were million in an increase of from million in Sales increased in filtration products industrial process cooling and HVAC Piping systems sales declined due to reduced activity at the U A E facility and no large project related revenue at the India facility Gross profit of million in decreased from million in Gross margin was compared to in Gross profit increased significantly in filtration products industrial process cooling and HVAC due to increased sales volume and margin improvements Piping systems gross profit decreased considerably to million in from million in due to lower volume at the U A E facility and no large project related activity at the India facility In the second quarter piping systems also incurred a one time extended service claim of approximately million General and administrative expenses decreased to million from million The reduction was mainly due to lower profit based management incentive compensation expense lower stock compensation expense and lower legal expenses partially offset by start up costs for piping systems new facility in Saudi Arabia Selling expenses increased to million from million A change in piping systems domestic sales commission program resulted in increased sales commission expense additional sales in industrial process cooling led to higher commission expense and higher healthcare costs were partially offset by reduced costs from closing the facility in South Africa recorded in The Company s worldwide effective income tax rates ETR for and were and respectively For additional information see the Income Tax section of the MD A and see Note Income taxes in the Notes to the Financial Statements Net loss was million compared to net income of million in This change is mainly the result of lower volume at the U A E facility and no large project related activity at the India facility Furthermore piping systems incurred expenses of million for the fourth quarter and million for relating to the new start up facility in Saudi Arabia Piping Systems The adverse effect of the credit crisis experienced by the Emirate of Dubai has significantly decelerated construction activity both in the U A E and across other GCC countries negatively impacting sales volume at the U A E facility The manufacturing facility in Dammam Saudi Arabia is production ready and staff has been recruited and trained Initial customer orders have been received technical submittals are awaiting approval and procurement of raw materials is currently underway Expenses of million for the fourth quarter and million for relating to this new start up facility were recorded to cost of goods sold general and administrative and selling expenses Piping systems domestic sales and earnings are seasonal typically lower during the fourth and first quarters due to unfavorable weather for construction over much of North America and are correspondingly higher during the second and third quarters in thousands Decrease Net sales Gross profit Percentage of net sales Percentage of net sales Despite significant sales drops in the Middle East and India net sales of million decreased only from million in the prior year due to reduced activity at the U A E facility and no large project related revenue at the India facility partially offset by a rise in domestic oil and gas product sales Gross margin decreased to of net sales from of net sales in the prior year due to lower volume at the U A E facility and no large project related activity at the India facility In the second quarter piping systems incurred a one time extended service claim of approximately million General and administrative expense decreased to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in The reduction in general and administrative expenses was due to lower profit based management incentive compensation legal expenses and reduced staffing at the U A E location partially offset by increased healthcare costs Selling expense increased to million or of net sales in from million or of net sales in This increase was due to a change in the domestic sales commission program which resulted in higher sales commission expense in the period Filtration Products The timing of large orders can have a material effect on net sales and gross profit from period to period Pricing on large orders was extremely competitive and therefore resulted in relatively low gross margins in all periods Filtration products is dependent on government regulation of air quality at the federal and state levels The Company believes that growth in the sale of its filtration products and services will be materially dependent on continued enforcement of environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act Although there can be no assurance what the ultimate effect of the Clean Air Act will be on filtration products the Company believes the Clean Air Act is likely to have a positive long term effect on demand for the Company s filtration products and services in thousands Increase Net sales Gross profit Percentage of net sales Income loss from operations Percentage of net sales Net sales increased to million in from million in due to improving business conditions in filtration products New pricing models are being used in an effort to shift the mix of products sold and improve overall profitability Gross margin increased to of net sales from of net sales in primarily due to cost containment efforts and improved product mix In July the Company announced that the facility in South Africa would close in the third quarter Expenses related to the closing were approximately thousand In these expenses were included in cost of goods sold general and administrative and selling expenses General and administrative expenses increased to million from million and as a percentage of net sales decreased to from in The dollar increase was due to additional staffing foreign exchange currency loss and an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by closing costs related to the facility in South Africa Selling expenses remained level at million Additional staffing and higher advertising expenses were offset by the closing of the South Africa facility Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from of net sales in Industrial Process Cooling in thousands Increase Net sales Gross profit Percentage of net

million from million in Gross margin remained constant as a percentage of net sales General and administrative expenses increased to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from in due to the effect of higher sales The change in spending was a result of restoring compensation to levels before wage reductions implemented during the economic downturn increased profit based management incentive compensation expense related to improved performance additional staffing and increased professional expenses including legal costs Selling expenses increased to million in from million in primarily driven by an increase in commission expense due to higher sales restoring compensation to levels before wage reductions implemented during the economic downturn and higher healthcare costs Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to from of net sales in due to the effect of higher sales Corporate and Other Net sales of million in increased from million in due to increased construction activity Corporate expenses include interest expense and general and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments General and administrative expenses decreased to million or of net sales from million or of net sales in The decrease was due to lower profit based management incentive and stock compensation expense Interest expense increased to million from million in primarily due to higher borrowings and interest rates Interest income increased to thousand from thousand due to higher cash balances held overseas in piping systems INCOME TAXES The Company s worldwide ETRs were and in and respectively The ETR in the periods presented was the result of the mix of income earned in multiple tax jurisdictions with various income tax rates Income earned in the U A E is not subject to any local country income tax The ETR in was less than the statutory U S federal income tax rate due to foreign losses and repatriation of foreign earnings The ETR in was less than the statutory U S federal income tax rate mainly due to the large portion of income earned in the U A E The January computation of the projected annual tax rate has been significantly impacted by the loss in the U A E for which no tax benefit can be provided The Company recorded million in tax expense associated with the million repatriation of foreign earnings that occurred in July These foreign earnings were previously considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States The repatriation was a one time nonrecurring event The Company has not provided Federal tax on unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries A deferred tax asset of million has been established for U S foreign tax credits attributed to repatriated foreign earnings The excess foreign tax credits are subject to a ten year carryforward and will expire in During the Company reevaluated the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and determined that no reserve was needed As of January and January no valuation allowance was deemed necessary on all domestic deferred tax assets except for certain state net operating losses NOL The Company believes that it will be more likely than not that the research and development credits will be utilized within the next five years therefore the Company has released the valuation allowance of million for the million research and development credits established in Another contributing factor to the unusual ETR is the valuation allowance set up on the NOL in Saudi Arabia The Company does not record a tax benefit for its start up entities As of January the Company had undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which deferred taxes have not been provided The Company intends and has the ability to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future outside the U S If these amounts were distributed to the U S in the form of dividends or otherwise the Company would be subject to additional U S income taxes Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs A reconciliation of the ETR to the U S Statutory tax rate is as follows Statutory tax rate Differences in foreign tax rate Foreign tax credit Research tax credit and release of valuation allowance Repatriation Valuation allowance for foreign and state NOLs Nontaxable income from the Canadian joint venture State taxes net of federal benefit All other net expense Effective income tax rate For further information see Note Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and cash equivalents as of January were million as compared to million at January The decrease was primarily for the new facility in Saudi Arabia The Company s working capital was million at January compared to million at January Cash used in operations in was million compared to cash provided by operations of million at January In July the Company recorded a one time million tax expense associated with a million repatriation of foreign earnings This tax expense included a payment of million to the foreign tax authority and an accrual of million U S tax on foreign source income No cash will be paid for this tax in the U S since the Company has a net operating loss carryforward for fed eral income taxes The Company does not intend to repatriate remaining unremitted foreign earnings and anticipates reinvesting these earnings overseas to fund current working capital requirements and expansion in foreign markets If the Company repatriates unremitted foreign earnings it will have negative tax implications Net cash used in investing activities in included million for capital expenditures primarily for machinery and equipment in piping systems of which million was related to the new plant in Saudi Arabia The Company estimates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million of which the Company may finance capital expenditures through real estate mortgages equipment financing loans internally generated funds and its revolving line of credit The majority of such expenditures relates to foreign growth within piping systems Debt totaled million at January a decrease of million since January Net cash used by financing activities was million Other long term liabilities of million were composed primarily of accrued pension cost and deferred compensation The following

have been included Refer to the proxy statement for a description of compensation plans for Named Executive Officers Refer to Note Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the uncertain tax position obligations Financing On July the Company entered into a secured loan and security agreement with a financial institution Loan Agreement Under the terms of the Loan Agreement as amended which matures on November the Company can borrow up to million subject to borrowing base and other requirements under a revolving asset based line of credit The Loan Agreement covenants restrict debt liens investments do not permit payment of dividends and require attainment of levels of profitability and cash flows At January the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement Interest rates are based on options selected by the Company as follows a a margin in effect plus a prime rate or b a margin in effect plus the LIBOR rate for the corresponding interest period At January the prime rate was the LIBOR rate was and the margins added to the prime rate and the LIBOR rate which are determined each quarter based on the applicable financial statement ratio were and percentage points respectively Monthly interest payments were made during the years ended January and As of January the Company had borrowed million and had million available to it under the revolving line of credit In addition million of availability was used under the Loan Agreement primarily to support letters of credit to guarantee amounts committed for inventory purchases The Loan Agreement provides that all domestic receipts are deposited in a bank account from which all funds may only be used to pay the debt under the Loan Agreement At January the amount of such restricted cash was million Cash required for operations is provided by draw downs on the line of credit The Company also has credit arrangements used by its Denmark and U A E subsidiaries These credit arrangements are in the form of overdraft facilities at rates competitive in the countries in which the Company operates At January borrowings under these credit arrangements totaled million an additional million remained unused CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES The Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item of this Annual Report on Form K The application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the Company as well as the related footnote disclosures The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable If actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates the revisions are included in the Company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenues including shipping and handling charges billed to customers when all the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and iii collectability is reasonably assured All subsidiaries of the Company except as noted below recognize revenues upon shipment or delivery of goods or services when title and risk of loss pass to customers Percentage of completion method revenue recognition All divisions recognize revenues under the above stated revenue recognition policy except for sizable complex contracts that require periodic recognition of income For these contracts the Company uses the percentage of completion accounting method Under this approach income is recognized in each reporting period based on the status of the uncompleted contracts and the current estimates of costs to complete The choice of accounting method is made at the time the contract is received based on the expected length and complexity of the project The percentage of completion is determined by the relationship of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of the contract Provisions are made for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined Changes in job performance job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income Such revisions are recognized in the period in which they are determined Claims for additional compensation due the Company are recognized in contract revenues when realization is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market Cost is determined using the first in first out method for all inventories Income taxes Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences arising from differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes Deferred income taxes on temporary differences have been recorded at the current tax rate The Company assesses its deferred tax assets for realizability at each reporting period The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority Equity based compensation Stock compensation expense for employee equity awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period of the award The Black Scholes option pricing model is utilized to estimate the fair value of awards Determining the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes model requires judgment including estimates for risk free interest rate an estimate based on the yield of zero coupon treasury securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option expected volatility an estimate based on the historical volatility of the Company s Common Stock and expected life of the option an estimate based on historical experience including the effect of employee terminations Fair value of financial instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable are based upon reasonable estimates of their fair value due to their short term nature The carrying value of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies approximated fair value and was based on the market value of the underlying investments which may increase or decrease due to fluctuations in the overall financial markets The carrying amount of the Company s short term debt revolving line of credit and long term debt approximate fair value because the majority of the amounts outstanding accrue interest at variable rates The Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce its exposure to market risks from changing interest rates under the revolving credit agreement Any differences paid or received on the interest rate swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest expense over the life of the swap thereby adjusting the effective interest rate on the underlying obligation Reclassifications Reclassifications were made to prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentations as required New accounting pronouncements See Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note New accounting pronouncements for

		<c><![CDATA[ Management s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years This review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables through included with this discussion and analysis Overview Compared to Net income for increased by over Earnings for were impacted by a bargain purchase gain and accelerated accretion on our preferred stock discount see discussion below Financial Highlights in thousands except per share data Change Earnings Net interest income Provision for loan losses non covered Provision for loan losses covered Noninterest income Noninterest expenses Income before income taxes Income tax expense Preferred stock dividends Accretion of preferred stock discount Net income available to common shareholders Net income per common share Basic Diluted At Year End Assets Loans Deposits Ratios Return on average assets Return on average common equity Net interest margin taxable equivalent The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for compared to For the year ended December we reported net income available to common shareholders of million compared to million reported for Earnings per diluted common share were for the year ended December compared to for In the first quarter of we realized a million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank which is recorded in noninterest income The after tax impact of this gain on net income was million or per diluted common share In the third quarter of we recorded million of accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on the preferred stock that was redeemed during the quarter This stock was originally issued to the U S Treasury in January as part of the program known as TARP When this preferred stock was redeemed the remaining discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the stock which had been on a five year accretion schedule was immediately accreted as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders Total discount accretion of the preferred stock for was million or per diluted common share Table of Contents In both and we experienced significant write downs and losses associated with loans and foreclosed properties that were assumed in two failed bank acquisitions The amounts of the write downs and losses were less in than in but continued to significantly impact our earnings We note that our results of operation are significantly affected by the on going accounting for the two FDIC assisted failed bank acquisitions that we have completed In the discussion below the term covered is used to describe assets included as part of FDIC loss share agreements which generally result in the FDIC reimbursing the Company for of losses incurred For covered loans that deteriorate in terms of repayment expectations we record immediate allowances through the provision of loan losses For covered loans that experience favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date including loans that payoff we record positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan also referred to as loan discount accretion For foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values we record gains losses within noninterest income The adjustments discussed above are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income The adjustments noted above can result in volatility within individual income statement line items Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans discount accretion and losses from covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset Total assets at December amounted to billion a increase from a year earlier Total loans at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier and total deposits amounted to billion at December a increase from a year earlier Since the onset of the recession we have generally experienced declines in loans and deposits Normal loan paydowns loan charge offs and loan foreclosures have exceeded new loan growth which has provided the liquidity to lessen our reliance on high cost deposits However for the last half of we experienced modest growth in our non covered loan portfolio which increased million from June through year end We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve our asset yields as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our preferred stock as discussed in Note to the consolidated financial statements Brokered deposits remained at a low level at December comprising just of total deposits with internet deposits comprising an additional Net interest income for the year ended December amounted to million an increase of million or from The higher net interest income was primarily caused by an increase in in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions Loan discount accretion amounted to million for compared to million in an increase of million As previously discussed the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only of the gross amount of the change See Net Interest Income below for additional information Table of Contents Our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets for was compared to for The higher margin was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in loan discount accretion as well as a decline in funding costs Our provisions for loan losses remain elevated compared to historical levels primarily due to continued high unemployment rates and ongoing declines in property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans Our provision for loan losses for non covered loans amounted to million for compared to million recorded in The lower provision in was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non covered nonperforming loans We recorded million in provision for loan losses on covered loans during compared to million recorded in The lower provision in was due to declines in covered nonperforming loans resulting from the resolution of a significant amount of these loans through a combination of charge offs and foreclosures Our non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to at December Our covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December Noninterest income for the year ended December amounted to million compared to million for The decline in noninterest income in is primarily due to lower amounts of indemnification asset income recorded As previously discussed when we anticipate receiving additional amounts from the FDIC because of new losses identified in our covered loan and foreclosed property portfolios we record indemnification asset income for of the expected loss In fewer new losses were identified compared to and thus less indemnification asset income was recorded Noninterest expenses for the year ended December amounted to million a increase from the million recorded in The majority of the increase relates to personnel expense which increased partially due to employees joining the Company in the Bank of Asheville acquisition We also experienced higher employee medical expense due to higher claims in compared to We have also progressively built our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens collection activities and the overall growth of the Company and to prepare for future growth which has generally resulted in higher expenses across all categories Our effective tax rates were and for the years ended December and respectively Table of Contents Overview Compared to Net income was significantly lower in than in primarily due to a gain that resulted from the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June Most items of income and expense were higher in than in as a result of the Cooperative acquisition which impacted the Company for twelve months in compared to six months in beginning with the June acquisition date In our provision for loan losses increased significantly due to deterioration of asset quality which we believe was primarily caused by the recessionary economic environment including its unfavorable effect on real estate values Financial Highlights in thousands except per share data Change Earnings Net interest income Provision for loan losses non covered Provision for loan losses covered n m Noninterest income Noninterest expenses Income before income taxes Income tax expense Preferred stock dividends Accretion of preferred stock discount Net income available to common shareholders Net income per common share Basic Diluted At Year End Assets Loans Deposits Ratios Return on average assets Return on average common equity Net interest margin taxable equivalent The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for compared to For the year ended December we reported net income available to common shareholders of million compared to million reported for Earnings per diluted common share were for the year ended December compared to for In the second quarter of we realized a million gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank The after tax impact of this gain was million or per diluted common share Earnings reported for were impacted by write downs of foreclosed properties that were assumed in our failed bank acquisition and also by higher provisions for loan losses related both to loans acquired in the failed bank acquisition and to our legacy loans loans not obtained in the failed bank acquisition Total assets at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier Total loans at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier and total deposits amounted to billion at December a decrease from a year earlier The contraction of our balance sheet was primarily a result of weak loan demand during which allowed us to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding Table of Contents We began experiencing a general decline in loans beginning in as the full effect of the recession took hold Loans declined approximately million or in Our deposits declined million or in The decrease was primarily associated with time deposits which are generally our highest cost source of funds We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program Net interest income for the year ended December amounted to million an increase from The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a higher net interest margin and the higher average balances of loans and deposits realized from the June Cooperative Bank acquisition Our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets for was compared to for During there were no changes in the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and we were able to continue to lower rates on our deposits especially on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher interest rates Also positively impacting net interest income were purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to our failed bank acquisition in including adjustments to loan interest income previously discussed See Net Interest Income below for additional discussion The economic environment including its unfavorable effect on real estate values resulted in an increase in our loan losses and nonperforming assets which led to significantly higher provisions for loan losses in Our provision for loan losses amounted to million for compared to million recorded in In our provision for loan losses was comprised of million in provisions related to non covered loans and million related to covered loans whereas in prior years the provision only related to non covered loans We recorded million and million in provision for loan losses during and respectively for non covered loans The higher provisions for loan losses were necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans We recorded million in provision for loan losses during related to covered loans that experienced credit quality deterioration The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent loans for which we received updated appraisals during that reflected lower valuations Net loan charge offs for were million compared to million in Net charge offs increased primarily as a result of declines in real estate values In net charge offs were also impacted by charge offs of covered loans and the recording of partial charge offs of non covered loans neither of which occurred during We recorded approximately million in charge offs of covered loans in compared to none in Also we recorded partial charge offs of non covered loans amounting to million during the fourth quarter of Previously we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses but did not record the charge offs until the loans were foreclosed upon Our non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to at December Table of Contents Our covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December Noninterest income for the year ended December amounted to million compared to million for In we recorded a million bargain purchase gain in connection with the acquisition of a failed bank In we recorded million in write downs and losses on foreclosed property the majority of which related to the market deterioration of foreclosed properties associated with the failed bank acquisition We recorded million in indemnification asset income related to higher than anticipated claims that we will be able to make with the FDIC under the loss share agreements primarily relating to loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write downs Noninterest expenses for the year ended December amounted to million a increase from the million recorded in Incremental operating expenses associated with the failed bank acquisition were the primary reason for the increases in Included in other operating expenses for were approximately million in costs net of FDIC reimbursements associated with collection activities on loans and foreclosed properties covered by FDIC loss share agreements compared to million in Our effective tax rates were and for the years ended December and respectively The lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to increased investment holdings of tax exempt municipal securities Outlook for We expect the banking industry particularly in our region to continue to face significant challenges in While there has been some favorable national economic data reported in recent months we have seen little if any improvement in the unfavorable economic statistics affecting our region These include unemployment rates housing starts home prices and the number of personal and business bankruptcies We believe that the Carolinas and Virginia may have been relatively late to experience the downturn in the national economy and that this region is lagging the rest of the country in recovery Thus we believe that our loan losses will continue to remain at elevated levels compared to historical norms We also expect that the weak economy will continue to result in low loan demand We believe that regulatory reform will negatively impact our earnings The regulatory climate is not favorable for banks We expect additional overhead costs will be necessary to comply with all of the new regulations expected to arise directly or indirectly from the Dodd Frank Act In and we acquired failed banks with approximately and million in assets respectively These acquisitions resulted in significant volatility to our earnings in and primarily as a result of the bargain purchase gains recorded on the acquisition dates that increased earnings and write downs of foreclosed properties in and that negatively impacted earnings While we expect the acquisitions to eventually be accretive to earnings on a consistent basis we believe that they may continue to add volatility to our reported earnings in The volatility may be positive to earnings which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans improves or negative to earnings which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans deteriorates or if the properties we have foreclosed on continue to decline in value Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation The allowance for loan losses intangible assets and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC assisted transactions are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements Allowance for Loan Losses Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses This model has two components The first component involves the estimation of losses on non single family home loans or relationships greater than that are defined as impaired loans A loan is considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement The estimated valuation allowance is the difference if any between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate or in the case of a collateral dependent loan the fair value of the collateral The second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for impaired single family home loans impaired loans or relationships less than and all loans not considered to be impaired loans Impaired single family home loans impaired loans or relationships less than and loans that we have classified as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type based on the historical losses current economic conditions and operational conditions specific to each loan type Loans that we have risk graded as having more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired are segregated between those relationships with outstanding balances exceeding and those that are less than that amount For those loan relationships with outstanding balances exceeding we review the attributes of each individual loan and assign any necessary loss reserve based on various factors including payment history borrower strength collateral value and guarantor strength For loan relationships less than with more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired loss percentages are based on a multiple of the estimated loss rate for loans of a similar loan type with normal risk The multiples assigned vary by type of loan depending on risk and we have consulted with an external credit review firm in assigning those multiples The reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans This becomes our allocated allowance In addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model we also evaluate other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans net loan growth information nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data Based on this additional analysis we may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses This additional amount if any is our unallocated allowance The sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded Table of Contents Loans covered under loss share agreements are recorded at fair value at acquisition date Therefore amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become a part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan Proportional adjustments are also recorded to the FDIC indemnification asset Although we use the best information available to make evaluations future material adjustments may be necessary if economic operational or other conditions change In addition various regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process periodically review our allowance for loan losses Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations For further discussion see Nonperforming Assets and Summary of Loan Loss Experience below Intangible Assets Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements When we complete an acquisition transaction the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset with any remaining amount classified as goodwill Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment but not systematically amortized Assuming no goodwill impairment it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible whereas when we acquire an insurance agency the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions customer attrition runoff alternative funding costs deposit servicing costs and discount rates We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years with an accelerated rate of amortization For insurance agency acquisitions the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years with amortization occurring on a straight line basis Subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives as discussed above In addition on at least an annual basis goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value including goodwill our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions Table of Contents At our last goodwill impairment evaluation as of September we determined the fair value of our community banking operation was approximately per common share or higher than the stated book value of our common stock at the date of valuation To assist us in computing the fair value of our community banking operation we engaged a consulting firm who used various valuation techniques as part of their analysis which resulted in the conclusion of the value We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions such as those listed above Fair Value and Discount Accretion of Loans Acquired in FDIC Assisted Transactions We consider the determination of the initial fair value of loans acquired in FDIC assisted transactions the initial fair value of the related FDIC indemnification asset and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity We determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance However the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates the FDIC indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the FDIC Because of the inherent credit losses associated with the acquired loans in a failed bank acquisition the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers with the difference being referred to as the discount on the acquired loans We have applied the cost recovery method of accounting to all purchased impaired loans due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected cash flows This will result in the recognition of interest income on these impaired loans only when the cash payments received from the borrower exceed the recorded net book value of the related loans For nonimpaired purchased loans we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs Merger and Acquisition Activity In both and we completed a FDIC assisted transaction of a failed bank There were no significant acquisitions in The results of each acquired company branch are included in our financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions In October we announced that we had entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank headquartered in Whiteville North Carolina The agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches from Waccamaw Bank which includes assuming all deposits selected performing loans and all premises and equipment Deposits total approximately million and loans total approximately million This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information Table of Contents FDIC Indemnification Asset As previously discussed on June and January we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville respectively in FDIC assisted transactions For each transaction the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two loss share agreements with the FDIC which afford First Bank significant loss protection Under the Cooperative Bank loss share agreements the FDIC will cover of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to million and of losses in excess of that amount Under The Bank of Asheville loss share agreements the FDIC will cover of all covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses For both transactions the loss share reimbursements are applicable for ten years for single family home loans and five years for all other loans We have recorded a FDIC indemnification asset related to the two transactions to account for payments that we expect to receive from the FDIC related to the loss share agreements The carrying value of this receivable at each period end is the sum of actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been received and our estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied by the FDIC reimbursement percentage At December and the FDIC indemnification asset was comprised of the following components in thousands Receivable related to claims submitted not yet received Receivable related to estimated future claims on loans Receivable related to estimated future claims on other real estate owned FDIC indemnification asset As of each acquisition date based on the losses inherent in the covered assets and what we estimated we would receive as payments from the FDIC we recorded a FDIC Indemnification Asset Since that time we have recorded adjustments to the indemnification asset as discussed below The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted upwards in the following circumstances Deterioration of credit quality of covered loans As of the acquisition dates we recorded the loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville on our books at a fair value that was million and million respectively less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio As the credit quality of these portfolios change and better information is obtained about likely losses some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected For loans with worse repayment expectations we record provisions for loan losses with corresponding increases to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage In and we recorded provisions for loan losses on covered loans amounting to million and million respectively which resulted in an adjustment to the FDIC indemnification asset of million and million respectively There were no such adjustments in Write downs and losses on foreclosed properties When we foreclose on delinquent borrowers we initially record the foreclosed property at the lower of book or fair value based on current appraisals with any deficiency recorded as a charge off Subsequent to the foreclosure we periodically order updated appraisals and if the appraisal indicates a fair value lower than our carrying value we must write the property down Also periodically we sell foreclosed properties that result in losses Each of these situations results in the Company recording losses on other real estate owned with a corresponding increase to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage In and we recorded losses and write downs on covered foreclosed properties amounting to million and million respectively which resulted in upward adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset of million and million respectively There were no such adjustments in Table of Contents Expenses incurred related to collection activities on covered assets As a result of our collection efforts we incur expenses such as legal fees property taxes and appraisal costs Many of these expenses are reimbursable by the FDIC These expenses are recorded as other noninterest expenses and a corresponding increase is made to increase the FDIC indemnification asset by reducing the gross collection expenses by the amount expected to be reimbursed by the FDIC for eligible expenses In and we incurred million million and million in gross collection expenses related to covered assets respectively and reduced that amount by million million and million in FDIC reimbursements respectively The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted downwards in the following circumstances Receipt of cash from the FDIC related to claims submitted On at least a quarterly basis we submit eligible loss share claims to the FDIC After reviewing and approving the claims the FDIC wires us cash which reduces the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset In and we received million million and million in FDIC reimbursements respectively Accretion of discount on acquired loans As noted above we recorded the acquired loans of the two transactions on our books at a fair value that was million in total less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers the discount which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio As the credit quality of this portfolio changes and better information is obtained about likely losses some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected discussed above For loans with improved repayment expectations we are systematically reducing the discount over the life of the loan as it repays For some loans we have received complete payoffs at the contractual balance and the discount must be reduced to zero When we reduce accrete the discount we do so by recognizing interest income in that same amount When the expected losses on loans with improved repayment expectations becomes less than the original estimate our expected reimbursement from the FDIC declines as well Accordingly we reduce the FDIC indemnification asset by the corresponding reimbursement percentage In and we recorded discount accretion of million million and million respectively which resulted in a reduction of FDIC indemnification asset of million million and million respectively In summary circumstances that result in adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income The adjustments can result in volatility within individual income statement line items Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses interest income and losses from foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset Table of Contents The following presents a rollforward of the FDIC indemnification asset since the date of the Cooperative Bank acquisition on June in thousands Balance at June Decrease related to favorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Balance at December Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Balance at December Increase related to acquisition of The Bank of Asheville Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Other Balance at December ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net interest income the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities constitutes the largest source of our earnings Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries occupancy expense equipment expense and other overhead costs as well as the effects of income taxes Net Interest Income Net interest income on a reported basis amounted to million in million in and million in For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows we evaluate our net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax exempt securities to reported interest income Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis amounted to million in million in and million in Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non taxable investments that may have existed during those periods The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income Year ended December in thousands Net interest income as reported Tax equivalent adjustment Net interest income tax equivalent Table analyzes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis Our net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by in and in There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record changes in our loans and deposits balances and our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets Table of Contents For the increase in net interest income over the comparable period in was due to a higher net interest margin which was partially offset by a lower level of earning assets due to a contraction of our balance sheet during In higher average loan and deposit balances increased net interest income Also the positive effects of the increased balances in were enhanced by a higher net interest margin Although our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in early resulted in the addition of million in loans our average loan balances declined by million during the year from billion in to billion in We believe the decline in loans is primarily a direct and indirect result of the weak economy in our market area During we charged off million in loans and foreclosed on another million that reduced our loan balances with a portion of the charge off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions Also loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations With the decline in loans we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits which resulted in lower deposit balances and as discussed below a lower average cost of funds Although loans and deposits outstanding decreased during calendar year the average balances of loans and deposits were both higher in than they were in as a result of the Cooperative Bank acquisition that occurred in mid The loans and deposits acquired in this acquisition impacted loan and deposit balances outstanding for all twelve months of and for the six month period subsequent to the June acquisition As illustrated in Table the lower average loan and deposit balances negatively impacted net interest income in while higher balances positively impacted net interest income in In declines in interest earning assets primarily loans resulted in a decrease in interest income of million while lower amounts of interest bearing liabilities resulted in only million of lower interest expense As a result the net impact of lower loans and deposits was a decrease in tax equivalent net interest income of million in In growth in interest earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of million while higher amounts of interest bearing liabilities only resulted in million in increased interest expense As a result the higher average balances of loans and deposits resulted in an increase in tax equivalent net interest income of million in Table also illustrates the impact that changes in the interest rates that we earned paid had on our net interest income in and In both years lower interest rates on deposits was the primary factor affecting net interest income Although the prime rate of interest has not changed since interest rates on U S Treasury bonds and other interest sensitive financial instruments have steadily declined since then resulting in a generally lower interest rate environment In both years the progressively lower interest rate environment gave us the opportunity to reduce rates on matured time deposits and we were also able to gradually reduce interest rates on demand deposits In the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by million and in the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by million The lower interest rate environment had much less impact on our interest income with the impact of changes in interest rates lowering interest income by million in and increasing it by million in The lesser impact was due to continued use of interest rate floors on loans as well as the effect of higher levels of loan discount accretion in both and discussed below Overall changes in interest rates increased net interest income by million in and million in We measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled net interest margin which is defined as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets Our net interest margin increased basis points in to from in Our net interest margin was in Table of Contents The primary reason for the increases in our net interest margin has been that the yields on interest earning assets have remained fairly stable over the past three years ranging from to while the cost of interest bearing liabilities has steadily declined from in to in to in As noted above our interest earning asset yields have remained stable because of the continued use of interest rate floors on loans as well as higher levels of loan discount accretion Also as noted above we have been able to lower rates on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher rates throughout and And to a lesser degree we have been able to progressively lower interest rates on various types of savings NOW and money market accounts We have also experienced declines in our levels of higher cost deposit balances including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits During each of the past three years our net interest margin also benefitted from the net accretion of purchase accounting premiums discounts associated with the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June and to a lesser degree the acquisition of Great Pee Dee Bancorp in April and The Bank of Asheville in January For and we recorded million million and million respectively in net accretion of purchase accounting premiums discounts that increased net interest income The following table provides detail of the purchase accounting adjustments that impacted net interest income in thousands Year Ended December Year Ended December Year Ended December Interest income reduced by premium amortization on loans Interest income increased by accretion of loan discount Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of deposits Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of borrowings Impact on net interest income The following table presents the purchase accounting entries that we expect to record in in thousands Expected Interest income reduced by premium amortization on loans Interest income increased by accretion of loan discount See note below Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of deposits Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of borrowings Impact on net interest income See note below Note We cannot determine the amount of interest income if any to be recognized from the accretion of the loan discount on Cooperative loans or The Bank of Asheville loans because it is reliant on our ongoing assessment during the year of the repayment period of the loans which is impacted by any changes in expected credit losses related to the loans See additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled Interest Rate Risk Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth an evaluation of the portfolio current economic conditions historical loan loss experience and other risk factors Our provisions for loan losses and nonperforming assets remain at what we believe to be elevated levels primarily due to high unemployment rates and declining property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans For and our total provisions for loan losses were million million and million respectively The total provision for loan losses is comprised of provision for loan losses for non covered loans and provision for loan losses for covered loans as discussed in the following paragraphs Table of Contents We recorded million million and million in provisions for loan losses related to non covered loans for the years ended December and respectively The lower provision for loan losses for non covered loans in compared to was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non covered nonperforming loans The higher provision for non covered loans in was necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans In and we recorded million and million in provisions for loan losses for covered loans respectively that experienced credit quality deterioration The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals in and that reflected lower valuations The lower provision for loan losses for covered loans in compared to was primarily due to lower levels of nonperforming covered loans Because of the FDIC loss share agreements in place for these loans the FDIC indemnification asset was adjusted upwards by recording noninterest income of million and million in and respectively or of the amount of the provisions see discussion above Total net charge offs for the years ended December and were million million and million respectively As discussed further below the higher net charge offs in and compared to were primarily a result of worsening economic conditions especially related to real estate that resulted in higher levels of borrowers not repaying their loans Net charge offs for non covered loans were million million and million for and respectively Net charge offs of non covered loans were impacted by million and million in partial charge offs of non covered loans for and respectively Prior to we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses but did not record charge offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon Net charge offs for covered loans were million million and in for and respectively The charge offs of covered loans were primarily a result of declining collateral values on collateral dependent nonaccrual loans In and our provisions for loan losses and net charge offs were concentrated in loans classified as real estate construction land development other land loans This category of loans is primarily comprised of land acquisition and development loans and other types of lot loans These types of loans have been particularly hard hit by the decline in real estate development and property values As can be seen in Table although we have reduced our exposure to this category of loans we continue to have exposure to this sector and future significant losses could result Non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million and million at December and respectively At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to and at December and respectively Also see Nonperforming Assets below for additional discussion See the section entitled Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses The allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses Table of Contents Noninterest Income Our noninterest income amounted to million in million in and million in As shown in Table core noninterest income excludes gains from acquisitions foreclosed property write downs and losses indemnification asset income securities gains or losses and other miscellaneous gains and losses Core noninterest income amounted to million in a increase from million in The core noninterest income of million was higher than the million recorded in See Table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income Service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to million a decrease compared to million recorded in The million recorded in was less than the amount of million Legislation that became effective on July reduced our fees earned on overdrafts in and which was the primary reason for the declines in this component of noninterest income Specifically the legislation now prohibits us from charging an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents or opts in to our payment of overdrafts for these transactions Additional regulations on overdraft fees became effective July that further reduced our overdraft fees although to a lesser extent than the changes In April we implemented new fees on deposit accounts such as fees for customers that elect to receive paper statements that have helped to replace a large portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the overdraft legislation Other service charges commissions and fees amounted to million in a increase from the million earned in The amount of million was a increase from the million earned in This category of noninterest income includes items such as electronic payment processing revenue which includes fees related to credit card transactions by merchants and customers and fees earned from debit card transactions ATM charges safety deposit box rentals fees from sales of personalized checks and check cashing fees The growth in this category for both years was primarily attributable to increased debit card usage by our customers as we earn a small fee each time our customers make a debit card transaction Also part of the increase in this category is due to the overall growth in our total customer base including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions Fees from presold mortgages amounted to million in million in and million in We continue to experience higher mortgage refinance activity due to lower interest rates Commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to million in each of and This line item includes commissions we receive from three sources sales of credit life insurance associated with new loans commissions from the sales of investment annuity and long term care insurance products and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance The following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item Table of Contents in thousands Commissions earned from Sales of credit life insurance Sales of investments annuities and long term care insurance Sales of property and casualty insurance Total Noninterest income not considered to be core resulted in a net contribution to total noninterest income of million in million in and million in The components of non core noninterest income are shown in Table and the significant components thereof are discussed below In and we recorded million and million in write downs and losses on foreclosed properties respectively of which million and million related to write downs on covered properties respectively Consistent with the other failed bank accounting adjustments discussed earlier the bottom line impact to pretax income of these write downs on covered properties was of the gross write downs Indemnification asset income for and amounted to million and million respectively with no corresponding amount in This income primarily relates to upward adjustments to the amount expected to be received from the FDIC under loss share agreements as a result of higher than anticipated loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write downs as follows in millions Higher expected FDIC claims for covered loans experiencing a deterioration in quality Lower expected FDIC claims for covered loans related to loan discount accretion and principal paydowns payoffs Foreclosed property losses and write downs covered Total adjustment to expected FDIC loss share claims Expected reimbursement rate Indemnification asset income In and as previously discussed we realized gains from the FDIC assisted acquisitions of failed banks amounting to million and million respectively which were the amounts by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed in each transaction The line item Other gains losses was positively impacted in by the sale of our merchant credit card processing portfolio which resulted in a gain of Noninterest Expenses Noninterest expenses for were million compared to million in and million in Table presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years As reflected in the amounts noted above noninterest expenses increased in and in The increases in noninterest expenses over the past three years have occurred in almost every line item of expense and have been primarily a result of our significant growth Due to acquisition and internal growth over the past three years our number of bank branches has increased from to and the number of full time equivalent employees has increased from at December to at December Additionally from December to December the amount of loans outstanding increased and deposits increased Table of Contents Total personnel expense increased by approximately million or in Salaries expense comprised million of this increase which was primarily a result of an initiative to progressively build our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens collection activities and overall growth of the Company as well as to prepare for future growth Another factor in the increase in salaries expense in was the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January which added approximately employees Higher employee health insurance costs also played a role in the increase in personnel expense in Employee health insurance expense amounted to million in an increase of million over the million incurred in We self insure our employees health care expense therefore incurred health care costs directly impact the expense we record In salaries expense increased million primarily due to a full year of salaries related to employees assumed in the June Cooperative acquisition The increase in salary expense was partially offset by lower health care expenses of million and lower pension expense in of million Pension expense decreased during primarily due to investment gains experienced by the pension plan s assets in In and we incurred acquisition expenses of approximately million in connection with The Bank of Asheville acquisition and million in connection with the Cooperative Bank acquisition respectively Acquisition expenses for both periods consisted primarily of professional fees FDIC deposit insurance expense declined in each of the past two years In and we incurred approximately million million and million respectively in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense The million in FDIC insurance expense for included a special assessment which applied to all banks of million As previously discussed the FDIC changed its premium assessment methodology in April which was favorable for our company and reduced our expense in Due to higher levels of delinquencies and foreclosure activity including those associated with our covered assets we recorded million in repossession and collection expenses net of FDIC reimbursements in compared to million in and million in Within the non credit losses presented in Table we recorded million in in connection with a fraud loss Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was million in million in and million in Table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates The effective tax rate for was compared to in and in The variances in effective tax rates are primarily due to changes in the proportion of tax exempt interest income to pretax income We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in Stock Based Compensation We recorded stock based compensation expense of million million and million for the years ended December and respectively See Note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock based compensation Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION Over the past two years our total assets have decreased from billion at December to billion at December which was primarily due to declines in our outstanding loans and deposits Changes in our loans and deposit balances occur as a result of organic growth or decline as well as acquisitions During the first quarter of we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC assisted failed bank transaction The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in and in thousands Balance at beginning of period Internal growth Growth from Acquisitions Balance at end of period Total percentage growth Internal percentage growth Loans Non covered Loans Covered Total loans Deposits Noninterest bearing Deposits NOW Deposits Money market Deposits Savings Deposits Brokered time Deposits Internet time Deposits Time retail Deposits Time retail Total deposits Loans Non covered Loans Covered Total loans Deposits Noninterest bearing Deposits NOW Deposits Money market Deposits Savings Deposits Brokered time Deposits Internet time Deposits Time retail Deposits Time retail Total deposits Excludes the impact of acquisitions in the year of the acquisition but includes growth or declines in acquired operations after the date of acquisition In as derived from the table above our total loans declined million or Positively impacting loans outstanding was our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville on January which added million in loans However this increase was more than offset by loan payoffs foreclosures and loan charge offs During we charged off million in loans and foreclosed on another million that reduced our loan balances with a portion of the charge off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions Also loan demand in most of our market areas has remained weak with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations In addition we have de emphasized certain types of lending most notably acquisition and development land loans and non owner occupied commercial real estate Table of Contents However for the first time since our loans outstanding began trending downward in we experienced sequential quarterly growth in our non covered loan portfolio during each of the last two quarters of with non covered loans increasing by million during the last half of We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve asset yields as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our SBLF preferred stock see Note to the consolidated financial statements for more information To start our total deposits increased by million as a result of the January acquisition of The Bank of Asheville For the remainder of the year as our loans declined we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding including internet deposits and time deposits which resulted in generally declining deposit balances Our lowest cost deposits noninterest bearing demand accounts and NOW accounts experienced positive internal growth of million and million respectively In addition to our bank wide emphasis to grow these types of low rate accounts the increase in NOW accounts was impacted by million in customer funds that were shifted from repurchase agreements securities sold under agreements to repurchase to NOW accounts during late In July the Dodd Frank Act repealed certain sections of the Federal Reserve Act that prohibited payment of interest on commercial demand deposits With this prohibition removed we began to pay interest on certain types of commercial demand accounts and we encouraged our customers with repurchase agreements to switch to commercial NOW accounts which eliminated the need to sell pledge our investment securities For the same reasons as discussed above for we experienced a decline in loans of in In we also experienced a decline in deposits of with most of the decline occurring in retail time deposits Retail time deposits are generally a high cost source of funds for us and during we decided not to match promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources and consequently we experienced a loss of time deposits Also declining significantly in was our level of internet time deposits Our level of time deposits gathered from internet posting services declined from million at December to million at December Substantially all of our internet deposits during were assumed in the Cooperative acquisition in Prior to its closing Cooperative was prohibited from originating or renewing brokered deposits and accordingly they enhanced liquidity by offering relatively high interest rates on internet posting services As these time deposits have matured the internet depositors mostly credit unions have elected not to renew the time deposits at the interest rates we have proposed In we replaced most of the lost internet deposits with brokered deposits which had more favorable interest rates As a result our brokered deposits increased from million at December to million at December We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds in the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program This program previously provided unlimited FDIC insurance for interest bearing transaction accounts earning interest rates up to Subsequent to this change the only accounts with unlimited FDIC insurance are non interest bearing transaction accounts Our overall liquidity increased slightly during compared to We experienced a million increase in deposits while loans decreased million With the excess deposits we were able to reduce our borrowings by approximately million during Our liquid assets cash and securities as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from at December to at December Our capital ratios improved in All of our capital ratios have continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for well capitalized status for all periods covered by this report Table of Contents Due to the continued economic slowdown our asset quality ratios remain at unfavorable levels compared to most of our company s history Our non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets ratio was at December compared to at December and at December For the year ended December our ratio of net non covered charge offs to average non covered loans was compared to for and for Distribution of Assets and Liabilities Table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December and Our balance sheet distribution has remained relatively stable over the past three years The increase in NOW deposits discussed earlier resulted in an increase in this category from of total liabilities and shareholders equity at December to in Also over the past two years we have experienced a decline in retail time deposits less than other time deposits that has resulted in other time deposits declining from of total liabilities and shareholders equity in to in Securities Information regarding our securities portfolio as of December and is presented in Tables and The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits We obtain fair values for the vast majority of our investment securities from a third party investment recordkeeper who specializes in securities purchases and sales recordkeeping and valuation This recordkeeper provides us with a third party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third party valuation service on a quarterly basis Total securities amounted to million million and million at December and respectively The majority of our government sponsored enterprise securities are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank and carry one maturity date often with an issuer call feature At December of the million carrying value in government sponsored enterprise securities million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system Our million of mortgage backed securities have all been issued by either Freddie Mac Fannie Mae Ginnie Mae or the Small Business Administration each of which are government sponsored corporations We have no private label mortgage backed securities Mortgage backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans Included in mortgage backed securities at December were collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million The CMOs that we have invested in are substantially all early tranche portions of the CMOs which minimizes our long term interest rate risk Table of Contents At December our million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following in thousands S P Issuer Maturity Amortized Market Issuer Ratings Date Cost Value First Citizens Bancorp South Carolina Bond Not Rated Bank of America Trust Preferred Security BB Bank of America Trust Preferred Security BB First Citizens Bancorp North Carolina Trust Preferred Security BB First Citizens Bancorp South Carolina Trust Preferred Security Not Rated Total investment in corporate bonds The ratings are as of January Substantially all of our investment in equity securities at each year end was comprised of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB The FHLB requires us to purchase their stock in order to borrow from them The amount they require us to invest is based on our level of borrowings from them At December our investment in capital stock of the FHLB amounted to million of our total investment in equity securities of million Until February the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as borrowings were repaid On February the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when loans are repaid Instead they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis During and the FHLB repurchased million and million respectively of their stock from the Company The fair value of securities held to maturity which we carry at amortized cost was more than the carrying value at December and less than the carrying value at December Our million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout our market area We have only two municipal bonds with a denomination greater than and we have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity with the single largest exposure to any one entity being Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations At December and a net unrealized gain of and respectively was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale During the past three years interest rates have generally declined which typically increases the value of our investment securities Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment not

the loan portfolio composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends As previously discussed in our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC which afford us significant protection from losses on all loans and other real estate acquired in those acquisitions Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC the financial risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans is significantly different from assets not covered under the loss share agreements Accordingly we present separately loans subject to the FDIC loss share agreements as covered loans and loans that are not subject to the loss share agreements as non covered loans Table a presents a breakout of covered and non covered loans as of December The loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans real estate mortgage loans real estate construction loans and consumer loans We restrict virtually all of our lending to our county market area which is located in western central and eastern North Carolina four counties in southern Virginia and five counties in northeastern South Carolina The diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment In loans outstanding decreased million or to billion In loans outstanding decreased million or to billion As previously discussed the declines for both years were mainly due to loan payoffs and loan foreclosures exceeding new loan growth as loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak The majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising to of our outstanding loan balances Except for real estate construction land development and other land loans the majority of our real estate loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower s occupation or business is the primary repayment source with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source Table indicates that the two types of loans that have had the largest variances in the amount outstanding as a percent of total loans have been construction land development loans and residential mortgage loans In we expanded our branch network to what was then the fast growing southeast coast of North Carolina which had a high demand for construction and land development loans In due to recessionary conditions particularly in the new housing market loan demand for these types of loans weakened and we tightened our loan underwriting criteria for these types of loans which reduced growth Due to economic conditions for the past three years we have made very few new acquisition and land development loans and we expect this trend to continue Table of Contents Our concentration of residential mortgage loans increased in as a result of the Cooperative acquisition because Cooperative s loan portfolio was heavily concentrated in residential mortgages In due to The Bank of Asheville acquisition our percentage of commercial real estate loans increased slightly as that bank s primary business had been commercial lending Table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately Approximately of our accruing loans outstanding at December mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years As of December the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and respectively We intentionally make a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans troubled debt restructurings loans past due or more days and still accruing interest and other real estate As a matter of policy we place all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off if appropriate may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings In some cases where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms Table summarizes our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC we present separately nonperforming assets subject to the loss share agreements as covered and nonperforming assets that are not subject to the loss share agreements as non covered Due largely to the economic downturn that began in late and continued to worsen over the past few years we have experienced increases in our non covered nonperforming assets Our total nonperforming assets were also significantly impacted by the Cooperative acquisition in Table a presents our nonperforming assets at December by general geographic region and further segregated into covered nonperforming assets and non covered nonperforming assets The majority of our nonperforming assets are located in the Eastern North Carolina region which has experienced the most negative effects of the recession of any of our regions Non covered nonperforming loans totaled million million and million as of December and respectively Total non covered nonperforming loans as a percentage of total non covered loans amounted to and at December and respectively At December and non covered troubled debt restructurings amounted to million million and million respectively The decline in is primarily a result of troubled debt restructurings that re defaulted and were placed on nonaccrual status The increase in was the result of our initiative to work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by modifying certain loan terms Table of Contents We also had million and million of covered troubled debt restructurings at December and respectively compared to none in The following is the composition by loan type of all of our nonaccrual loans at each period end as classified for regulatory purposes in thousands At

Installment loans to individuals Total nonaccrual loans The tables above indicate that covered nonaccrual loans declined from million at December to million at December This decrease was primarily a result of many of the nonaccrual loans at December being either charged off or being foreclosed upon in and their balances being transferred to other real estate during the year Non covered nonaccrual loans increased from million at December to million at December which was the result of continued economic hardship in our market areas particularly for the commercial real estate business Table of Contents If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period gross interest income in the amounts of approximately and for nonaccrual loans and and for restructured loans would have been recorded for and respectively Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in and amounted to approximately and for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and and for restructured loans respectively At December and we had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming Management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that in management s opinion have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans In addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above management believes that an estimated million of non covered loans and million of covered loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December see discussion below Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss doubtful substandard or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results liquidity or capital resources or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms Other real estate includes foreclosed repossessed and idled properties Non covered other real estate has increased over the past three years amounting to million at December million at December and million at December At December and we also held million million and million respectively in other real estate that is subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC We believe that the fair values of the items of other real estate less estimated costs to sell equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented The following table presents the detail of our other real estate at each of the past two year ends At December At December Vacant land family residential properties Commercial real estate Other Total other real estate Includes both covered and

Covered Other Real Estate Non covered Other Real Estate Total Other Real Estate Vacant land family residential properties Commercial real estate Other Total other real estate Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience The allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations known as a provision for loan losses for the period in which the charge is taken Losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans in management s opinion become uncollectible The recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance We consider our procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy See the heading Critical Accounting Policies above for further discussion The factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience composition of the loan portfolio evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions We use a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses In this program credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an independent third party consulting firm The testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses loans past due days or more loans originated by new loan officers nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations We strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market areas Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies We have no foreign loans few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan Collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within our principal market area The allowance for loan losses amounted to million at December compared to million at December and million at December At December and million and million respectively of the allowance for loan losses is attributable to covered loans that have exhibited credit quality deterioration due to lower collateral valuations while the allowance for loan losses for non covered loans amounted to million and million at those dates For all prior periods the entire allowance for loan losses is attributable to non covered loans Table of Contents The ratio of the allowance for non covered loan losses to non covered loans was and as of December and respectively The decrease in the percentage for is primarily attributable to lower specific reserves at December The increased allowance percentage in was necessary due to the higher level of delinquencies and classified and nonperforming loans Table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated The amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories Table a segregates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December and into covered and non covered categories As indicated in Tables and a the amount of the allowance allocated to Real Estate Construction and Land Development declined by million from December to December This decline was due to charge offs and the foreclosure and transfer to other real estate of a significant amount of covered land development loans Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date It must be emphasized however that the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio in light of conditions and factors then prevailing will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings In addition various regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations For the years indicated Table summarizes our balances of loans outstanding average loans outstanding and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses Table a presents a detailed rollforward of the and activity for the allowance for loan losses segregated into covered and non covered activity Net loan charge offs of non covered loans amounted to million in million in and million in The elevated amounts in and reflect the impact of deteriorating loan quality that has been impacted by the economic downturn Also in and we recorded million and million respectively in partial charge offs of non covered loans Previously we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loans losses but did not record charge offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon Net non covered charge offs as a percentage of average non covered loans represented and during and respectively We recorded million and million in charge offs of covered loans during and respectively primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals that reflected lower valuations Table of Contents Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase At December deposits outstanding amounted to billion an increase of million from December To begin deposits initially grew by million as a result of the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January For the remainder of the year our deposit base declined by million as a lack of loan growth allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits Our NOW deposits increased approximately million during with million being assumed in The Bank of Asheville acquisition and another million of the growth resulting from customers shifting their funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to a commercial interest bearing NOW account discussed earlier In despite the addition of million in time deposits and million in internet deposits from The Bank of Asheville acquisition we experienced overall net declines in these categories of million and million respectively due to our ability to lessen our reliance on these higher cost deposits as a result of weak loan demand and growth in our other lower cost deposit categories In deposits declined from billion to billion a decrease of million or from December Approximately million or of the decline in deposits was attributable to decreases in time deposits We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds during the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program The nature of our deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends Noninterest bearing deposits NOW deposits Money market deposits Savings deposits Brokered deposits Internet deposits Time deposits retail Time deposits retail Total deposits Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a percent of total deposits The deposit mix remained relatively consistent from to Our mix has gradually shifted over the past few years to a heavier concentration in transaction accounts and less concentration in our time deposits The percentages for retail time deposits have declined because we have chosen not to match certain promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources Our growth in other categories of deposits and our weak loan demand eliminated the need to match the higher competitor rates We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits such as emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and or retain deposits and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services Table presents the average amounts of our deposits and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December and Table of Contents As of December we held approximately million in time deposits of or more Table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of or more as of December This table shows that of our time deposits greater than mature within one year At each of the past three year ends we have no deposits issued through foreign offices nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors Borrowings We had borrowings outstanding of million at December compared to million at December and million at December Borrowings decreased from to primarily as a result of a decline in loans and growth in deposits that provided funds to pay down our borrowings During most of we held a lower level of borrowings until late in the year when we obtained borrowings to offset a portion of the liquidity decline we experienced as a result of the loss of deposits that was previously discussed Table shows that average borrowings were million in compared to million in and million in At December the Company had four sources of readily available borrowing capacity an approximately million line of credit with the FHLB of which million was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank of which none was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December an approximately million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond s FRB discount window of which none was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December and a million holding company line of credit with a commercial bank none of which was outstanding at December or Our line of credit with the FHLB can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by our FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio As of December none of the million outstanding with the FHLB were overnight borrowings All the FHLB borrowings were at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and maturity dates ranging from April to June For the year ended December the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of The maximum amount of short term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month end during was million In addition to the outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit our borrowing capacity was further reduced by million at December and as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each of those dates Our correspondent bank relationship allows us to purchase up to million in federal funds on an overnight unsecured basis federal funds purchased We had no borrowings under this line at December We had million outstanding under this line at December with a weighted average interest rate of There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month end during We also have a line of credit with the FRB discount window This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio excluding real estate loans Based on the collateral that we owned as of December the available line of credit was approximately million At December we had no borrowings outstanding under this line At December we had million in borrowings outstanding under this line There were no FRB borrowings outstanding at any month end during Table of Contents At December and we had a million holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by of the common stock of our bank subsidiary This line of credit expires and is subject to renewal in March of each year The line of credit had no outstanding balance at December or and was not drawn upon during or In addition to the lines of credit described above in which we had million and million outstanding as of December and respectively we also had a total of million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at December and We have initiated three trust preferred security issuances since totaling million with one of those issuances for million being redeemed in These borrowings each have year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date We issued million of this debt on October which we called in an additional million on December and million on April The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month LIBOR plus for the securities issued in and three month LIBOR plus for the securities issued in Liquidity Commitments and Contingencies We have a pending agreement to purchase eleven branches of another bank with approximately million in total deposits and million in total loans See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds and our ability to maintain required reserve levels pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations cash and due from banks federal funds sold and other short term investments Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash As noted above in addition to internally generated liquidity sources we currently March have the ability to obtain borrowings from the following four sources an approximately million line of credit with the FHLB a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank an approximately million line of credit through the FRB s discount window and a holding company line of credit with a limit of million Our overall liquidity increased slightly during compared to Our loans decreased by million while our deposits increased by million As a result our liquid assets cash and securities as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from at December to at December We continue to believe our liquidity sources including unused lines of credit are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate In the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows In addition there are commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit that may or may not require future cash outflows Table reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December Any of our million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances including material adverse changes in our condition or if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement Table of Contents In the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit which are not reflected in the financial statements The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December in millions Type of Commitment Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Outstanding closed end loan commitments Unfunded commitments on revolving lines of credit credit cards and home equity loans Total At December and we also had million and million respectively in standby letters of credit outstanding We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a guarantee made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier The maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit a note already executed by the customer becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral Over the past two years we have had to honor only a few standby letters of credit which involved insignificant amounts of funds and have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any loss to us We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits thus not requiring any net cash outflow Based on that assumption management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations We are not involved in any legal proceedings that in management s opinion could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company Capital Resources and Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity at December amounted to million compared to million at December The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders equity are net income which increases shareholders equity and dividends declared which decreases shareholders equity Additionally any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders equity In the most significant factors that impacted our equity were the redemption of million of our Series A Preferred Stock issued under the U S Treasury s Capital Purchase Program also known as TARP and the simultaneous issuance of million of Series B Preferred Stock under the Treasury s Small Business Lending Fund SBLF Net income of million for increased equity while common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million reduced equity We also recorded accretion of the discount on preferred stock of million due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock See Note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions Another significant factor negatively impacting equity in was a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss that was caused by an increase in our pension liability The increase in the pension liability was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on the actuarial calculations involved in determining the liability Our policy is to use the Citigroup Pension Index yield curve in the computation of the pension liability At December that index had a weighted average rate of which was a decline from the rate of at December See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders equity Table of Contents In the most significant factors that impacted our equity were net income of million which increased equity and common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million which reduced equity See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders equity In the most significant item that impacted our equity was our issuance of million in preferred stock to the U S Treasury in connection with our participation in the Treasury s Capital Purchase Program see Note to the consolidated financial statements In addition other significant factors were net income of million which increased equity and common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million which reduced equity See the consolidated financial statements for other less significant factors that impacted equity in We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which if they were to be implemented would have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or operations The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of Tier capital to total risk weighted assets Tier I Capital Ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets Total Capital Ratio of and respectively Tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale less intangible assets and total capital is comprised of Tier capital plus certain adjustments the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses Risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in FRB and FDIC regulations In addition to the risk based capital requirements described above the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets Leverage Ratio of to depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators The FRB has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to the Company Table presents our regulatory capital ratios as of December and All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized The specific guidelines are as follows Tier I Capital Ratio of at least Total Capital Ratio of at least and a Leverage Ratio of at least If a bank falls below well capitalized status in any of these three ratios it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits The Bank s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at December and see Note to the consolidated financial statements for a table that presents the Bank s regulatory ratios Table of Contents In addition to shareholders equity we have supplemented our capital in past years with trust preferred security debt issuances which because of their structure qualify as regulatory capital This was necessary in past years because our balance sheet growth outpaced the growth rate of our capital Additionally we have frequently purchased bank branches over the years that resulted in our recording intangible assets which negatively impacted regulatory capital ratios As discussed in Borrowings above we have issued a total of million in trust preferred securities since with the most recent issuance being a million issuance that occurred in April We currently have million in trust preferred securities outstanding In this economic environment our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least basis points higher than the well capitalized thresholds set for banks At December our total risk based capital ratio was compared to the well capitalized threshold In addition to regulatory capital ratios we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets TCE Ratio Our TCE ratio was at December compared to at December See Supervision and Regulation under Business above and Note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect our capital resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments Off balance sheet arrangements include transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity We have no off balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities Derivative financial instruments include futures forwards interest rate swaps options contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics We have not engaged in derivatives activities through December and have no current plans to do so Return on Assets and Equity Table shows return on assets net income available to common shareholders divided by average total assets return on common equity net income available to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per common share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average total shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended December Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings Notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits our level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to our various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities It is our policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection to the extent practical against wide interest rate fluctuations Our exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard GAP reports maturity reports and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates expected future interest rates and various intervals of shock interest rates Over the years we have been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin Over the past five calendar years our net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in During that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of which was the rate as of December to a high of The consistency of the net interest margin is aided by the relatively low level of long term interest rate exposure that we maintain At December approximately of our interest earning assets are subject to repricing within five years because they are either adjustable rate assets or they are fixed rate assets that mature and substantially all of our interest bearing liabilities reprice within five years Table of Contents Table sets forth our interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December using stated maturities for all fixed rate instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call As illustrated by this table at December we had million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets This generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment However this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings market value or management actions Also interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates In addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products For example included in interest bearing liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at December are deposits totaling billion comprised of NOW savings and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management These types of deposits historically have not repriced with or in the same proportion as general market indicators Overall we believe that in the near term twelve months net interest income will not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates Similarly we would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates Generally when rates change our interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change while our interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change In the short term less than six months this results in us being asset sensitive meaning that our net interest income benefits from an increase in interest rates and is negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates However in the twelve month horizon the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities lessens the short term effects of changes in interest rates The Federal Reserve has made no changes to interest rates since and since that time the difference between market driven short term interest rates and longer term interest rates has generally widened with short term interest rates steadily declining and longer term interest rates not declining by as much The higher long term interest rate environment enhanced our ability to require higher interest rates on loans As it relates to funding we have been able to reprice many of our maturing time deposits at lower interest rates We were also able to generally decrease the rates we paid on other categories of deposits as a result of declining short term interest rates in the marketplace and an increase in liquidity that lessened our need to offer premium interest rates Our net interest margin increased throughout and Our net interest margin was for a basis point increase from the margin realized in As previously discussed in the section Net Interest Income our net interest income was impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments related primarily to our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville The purchase accounting adjustments related to the premium amortization on loans deposits and borrowings are based on amortization schedules and are thus systematic and predictable The accretion of the loan discount on loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville which amounted to million and million for and respectively is less predictable and could be materially different among periods This is because of the magnitude of the discounts that were initially recorded million in total and the fact that the accretion being recorded is dependent on both the credit quality of the acquired loans and the impact of any accelerated loan repayments including payoffs If the credit quality of the loans declines some or all of the remaining discount will cease to be accreted into income If the underlying loans experience accelerated paydowns or are paid off the remaining discount will be accreted into income on an accelerated basis which in the event of total payoff will result in the remaining discount being entirely accreted into income in the period of the payoff Each of these factors is difficult to predict and susceptible to volatility Table of Contents Based on our most recent interest rate modeling which assumes no changes in interest rates for federal funds rate prime we project that our net interest margin for will remain relatively consistent with the net interest margins recently realized With interest rates having been stable for a relatively long period of time most of our interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities have been repriced at rates near today s interest rates We have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes nor do we maintain any foreign currency positions Table presents the expected maturities of our other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments Table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with relevant accounting guidance Our assets and liabilities have estimated fair values that do not materially differ from their carrying amounts See additional discussion regarding net interest income as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled Net Interest Income above Inflation Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories During periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets loans and deposits Also general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses Current Accounting Matters We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by among others the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic the FASB frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities See

ended December The following MD A concerning our operations is intended to satisfy three principal objectives Provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to see the company through the eyes of management Enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which our financial information should be analyzed and Provide information about the quality of and potential variability of our earnings and cash flow so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance Management s discussion and analysis like other portions of this Annual Report on Form K includes forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance However our anticipated future financial performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward looking statements A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is set forth under the caption Forward Looking Statements in Item A of this Annual Report on Form K This discussion and analysis should be considered in light of that cautionary statement This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes tables and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report All figures are in thousands except per share data and per employee data Table of Contents EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW Earnings reached a record high of per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of an increase of per share During higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income or while credit and foreclosure costs remained historically high at compared to during Noninterest and fee income during was largely unchanged compared to while operating expenses excluding loss on foreclosed assets declined or from lower FDIC insurance premium expense and lower debit card losses following a significant fraud loss during During total nonperforming assets increased or due to a increase in troubled debt that has been restructured but continues to pay according to its restructured terms However nonaccrual assets decreased or and foreclosed assets decreased or during Total nonperforming assets were or of total assets as of December compared or of total assets as of December During we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin While interest rates are not expected to change significantly during an initial period of rising interest rates should be expected to reduce net interest margin and potentially net interest income as funding costs increase with rising rates but floating rate loan yields remain at their floors for a time In addition a falling rate environment would lower loan yields to a greater extent than further deposit price reductions pressuring net interest margin and income During credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write down of foreclosed asset values compared to However we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned Due to stabilization of historically low long term interest rates on residential mortgages we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during In addition regulatory changes effective during for overdraft fee income and in for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs Taken together net income growth during is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during and Earnings were per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of During higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income or while income also benefited from a or decline in credit and foreclosure losses compared to Net interest income increased primarily from maintenance of interest rate floors on adjustable rate loans while deposit costs continued to fall Offsetting this increase to income was decreased noninterest and fee income down during or primarily from recognition of a gain on sale of securities Operating expenses increased or and included increased salaries and employee benefits of up and higher all other operating expenses excluding foreclosure costs of or Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily from an annual increase in base pay fewer deferred loan origination costs and increased year end incentive and profit sharing expense based on net income levels achieved Earnings were per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of However both years experienced nonrecurring items related to sale of securities and disposal of premises and equipment Pro forma net income before these special items was in and in a net income decline of during The decline was due to significantly higher provision for loan losses loss on sale of foreclosed assets and higher FDIC insurance expense Offsetting a portion of these increased expenses during were increases in net interest income from higher net interest margin and record levels of mortgage banking income Each of these factors was influenced by falling market interest rates occurring during the national recession then in effect Liquidity Total assets increased or less than to at December compared to at December While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased or Total net loans receivable increased or to at December Offsetting this increase in assets was a decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets Asset growth during is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt Core deposits increased during from a increase in year end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in Increased deposits were used to repay of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year end Wholesale borrowings including brokered and national deposits FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements increased during Wholesale borrowings were at December compared to at December Our most significant sources of liquidity and wholesale funding include federal funds purchased from correspondent banks FHLB advances brokered and national certificates of deposit and Federal Discount Window advances In addition to the federal funds sold position of we have of unused funding available at December which is considered adequate to meet customer operational and growth needs during Most of our wholesale funding sources require either pledging of assets maintenance of well capitalized regulatory status or additional purchases of FHLB capital stock or all of these items to continue or expand participation in the funding program In particular of potential FHLB advance funding considered available at December would require additional purchase of up to of their capital stock which pays a nominal dividend and for which no trading market exists Table of Contents Due in part to an expected reduction to future debit card income in response to Dodd Frank legislation and a qualifying account structure which required payment of a significantly greater than market rate of interest we discontinued sale of our Rewards Checking product during Rewards Checking was a retail high yield interest bearing checking account with account usage qualifications to earn the premium interest rate Qualifications included receipt of the monthly account statement via email at least debit card purchases per month and at least electronic transfer per month During Rewards Checking paid qualifying accounts a annual percentage yield on the first of balance and reimbursed customer ATM fees Since its introduction during Rewards Checking had been our primary source of retail deposit growth Absence of the Reward Checking product from our retail deposit product line could negatively impact future deposit growth Total assets increased or at December compared to December The majority of the increase was in cash and cash equivalents up as core deposits increased or The core deposit increase in was driven by a increase in our Rewards Checking high yielding NOW account and a large commercial money market account opened during by a related party A decline in net loans receivable of or primarily from lower commercial related loans was offset by increased investment securities and purchased bank certificates of deposit totaling up An increase in other borrowings and stockholders equity of along with the increase in deposits previously mentioned contributed to a reduction in wholesale deposits and FHLB advances of during Brokered deposits FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements were at December down or from at December Capital Resources We are considered well capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of at December compared to at December and at December Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of to be considered well capitalized During regulatory capital increased from higher retained earnings up over earnings retained during while risk adjusted assets increased just During total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to risk weighting rather than the risk weighting assigned in prior years In addition we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio These changes along with retained net income increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than On a book basis total tangible common equity reflected on the December Consolidated Balance Sheets was compared to at December and at December In response to Dodd Frank legislation banking regulatory agencies are expected to announce higher minimum capital standards for banks to be considered well capitalized during We issued of senior subordinated notes during which may be repaid in full during at our option and mature in Approximately of our total regulatory capital is comprised of debt instruments including junior and senior debentures and notes which unlike common stock require quarterly payments of interest Therefore although no current plans exist future capital needs during the next several years would likely be met by issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock as needed We expect to continue to pay our traditional semi annual cash dividend assuming continued profitable operations and projections of adequate future capital levels for growth and credit risk In addition any future growth through merger and acquisition activities should be expected to drain excess capital levels and could increase the likelihood of a new common or preferred stock capital raise potentially diluting existing stockholders Several years of low asset growth and high earnings levels have raised book and regulatory capital ratios to historically high levels For example our total regulatory capital ratio has increased from at December to at December Due to projected low levels of organic loan growth available in our existing markets and expectations for improving problem loan trends we are evaluating actions which could utilize excess capital to build shareholder value Our primary focus is on market and core deposit expansion via merger and acquisition of other banks with relatively low credit risk profiles and near our current markets If value added merger and acquisition options do not materialize in the near term we may consider repayment of our existing senior subordinated notes or resumption of our traditional stock repurchase program on the open market Such actions would decrease existing capital ratios but would be expected to increase net income or net book value per share Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Our largest volume off balance sheet activity involves our servicing of payments and related collection activities on approximately million of residential to family mortgages sold to FHLB and FNMA up million from million at December Serviced mortgage loans increased from customer refinance activity a trend which began during when serviced loans increased million or and continued with serviced loans increasing million or during As expected we experienced significantly slower growth during and we may not see significant organic growth in serviced loans in future years Proposals by the U S Treasury concerning FNMA and the FHLB could reduce the amount of annual servicing income currently of serviced mortgage balances annually paid to us to service future mortgages originated and sold to them Table of Contents We have provided a credit enhancement against FHLB loss on approximately of the serviced principal up to a maximum guarantee of million in the aggregate However we would incur such loss only if the FHLB first lost million on this loan pool of approximately million No sold loans have received our credit enhancement guarantee of principal since October and we have no intentions of originating future loans with the guarantee Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in only million of million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations During we experienced a loss from repurchase of a foreclosed loan with underwriting violations related to private mortgage insurance We reviewed our remaining portfolio of loans with similar origination circumstances and do not have a material exposure to future loss for loans underwritten in the same manner Absent this loss we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since and have not been required to repurchase any other loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expected to be required to repurchase loans in the near term We provide various commitments to extend credit for both commercial and consumer purposes totaling approximately million at December compared to million at December These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon Our primary long term contractual obligations are related to repayment of funding sources such as FHLB advances long term other borrowings and customer time deposits which make up of our total long term contractual obligations For all contractual obligations outstanding at December will require repayment or refinancing during although virtually of these obligations represent time deposits taken in the normal course of business During we originated a program to offer certain high credit quality customers fixed interest rate swaps to hedge their risk on variable rate commercial real estate loans with us Fixed interest rate swaps sold to customers in which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate are simultaneously offset by our purchase of a variable interest rate swap from a correspondent bank in which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate Such swap sale programs are often referred to back to back interest rate swaps as the resulting fixed interest rate risk with our customer is offset by our variable rate risk with our counterparty At December there were in back to back swaps outstanding with variable rate commercial real estate loan customers Earnings Table of Item of this Annual Report on Form K presents various financial performance ratios and measures for each of the five years in the period ended December A number of separate or nonrecurring factors impacted our earnings during through but none have had a significant impact to net income during and Table presents our net income for each of the five years in the period ended December before certain tax adjusted nonrecurring income and expense items Table Summary Operating Income Years

Court decision Diluted earnings per share before special items Diluted earnings per share as reported Table of Contents compared to Net earnings during were or per diluted share compared to or per

Credit costs totaled during a slight decline of or compared to primarily from lower provision for loan losses while loss on foreclosed assets increased from higher partial write downs of value

continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned Due to stabilization of historically low long term interest rates on residential mortgages we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during In addition regulatory changes effective during for overdraft fee income and during for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during We expect noninterest income to be less than due to these factors Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs Taken together net income growth during is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during and compared to Earnings reached a then record high of per share during an increase of over earnings of per share Increased earnings were led by higher net interest income of up from increased net interest margin and significantly lower credit and foreclosure costs down from earnings also benefited from continued high levels of mortgage banking refinance income which although less than in continued at historically high levels Service fees increased or from changes to our customer courtesy overdraft program during which recognized increased customer overdraft activity These increases to income were offset by higher salaries and employee benefits up from several factors including an annual increase in base wages lower deferral of direct loan origination expenses and higher year end incentive costs from meeting income growth goals Data processing costs increased or due in part to conversion to a new service bureau data processing system and related training and implementation costs Because the initial data processing contract called for reduced fees during the initial implementation period data processing fees are expected to increase significantly during Return on average assets was and during and respectively Return on average stockholders equity was and during and respectively compared to Earnings were per share during on net income of which declined from earnings of per share on net income of However earnings per share before special or nonrecurring items were in on pro forma net income of compared to in on pro forma net income of a decline of or The net decline in was due primarily to significantly greater credit related costs including combined provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed assets expense of during compared to in an increase of over These increased credit costs reduced net income by approximately after income tax benefits compared to During a national economic recession that began during reduced borrower ability to repay loans due to us increasing current net charge offs during as well as our expectation of future charge offs from existing economic factors in effect at that time The majority of the loss on foreclosed assets was a loss on a large land development foreclosure taken to auction during In addition to credit losses FDIC insurance expense premiums increased from in to in as Deposit Insurance Fund DIF reserves declined from payouts to certain depositors of failed banks in the United States FDIC insured banks as an industry were required to pay increased quarterly premiums as well as a special assessment to recapitalize the DIF Increased FDIC insurance expense lowered net income by approximately after tax benefits compared to Offsetting these increased expenses tax adjusted net interest income and mortgage banking income increased during compared to due to falling market interest rates caused by the economic recession The low interest rate environment prompted customers to refinance residential mortgages with us which we subsequently sold on the secondary market We also increased net interest income as very low short term interest rates were used to fund moderately longer dated and higher yielding loans and securities including adjustable rate loans with interest rate floors These factors increased net income by approximately after tax expense Table of Contents Return on average assets was and during and respectively Return on average stockholders equity was and during and respectively Excluding the FNMA preferred stock write down return on average assets would have been during and return on average equity would have been Balance Sheet Changes and Analysis Summary balance sheets at December for each of the five years in the period ended December are presented in Table of Item to this Annual Report on Form K Total assets increased or during the year ended December after increasing during the year ended December and increasing during the year ended December The asset growth rate continued a decline first seen during related to low customer loan demand as customers sought to reduce their debt obligations amidst economic uncertainty Presented in Table below is a summary balance sheet for the five years ended

Stockholders equity Total liabilities and stockholders equity compared to Total assets increased or less than to at December compared to at December While commercial related loan balances remained

conditions Core deposits increased during from a increase in year end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in Increased deposits were used to repay of local

during and were at December compared to at December Wholesale funding to total assets was at December and compared to Total assets were at December compared to at December an increase of or The majority of the increase was reflected in increased cash and cash equivalents up or during Commercial related loans declined as locally owned small and medium sized business credit demand declined and we continued to work out of existing problem credits Offsetting the decline in loan balances were increased investment securities and purchased certificates of deposit which increased or and an increase in residential mortgage lending up or Table of Contents Core deposits increased or during although increases in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of offset a decline in local certificates of deposit The combination of low customer loan demand and unusually high local competitor certificate of deposit pricing lessoned our demand for local certificate of deposit funding and contributed to the decline in balances At December money market funding included from a new account relationship obtained during the year from a related party In addition to the increase in local deposits overnight repurchase agreement funding from local customers reflected as other borrowings increased or during from acquisition of a new account relationship totaling at December These two large commercial relationships totaling at December were seasonal and declined significantly during Increased local deposits were used to repay wholesale deposits and FHLB advances during which declined or All wholesale funding including brokered deposits FHLB advances and wholesale other borrowings declined or to during compared to at December Wholesale funding to total assets was and at December and respectively Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans securities and other interest earning assets and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them Interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income Additionally net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates contractual maturities and repricing frequencies Net interest income is our most significant item of revenue generated by operations Table presents changes in the mix of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three years ending December In general net interest income earned on loans funded by savings and demand deposits is greater than that earned on securities funded by time deposits Therefore a balance sheet that contains a growing allocation of loans funded by a growing allocation of savings and demand deposits would normally provide greater net interest income than a growing allocation of securities funded by a growing

and retail residential home equity lines of credit to avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin from a sustained low interest rate environment and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate At December approximately of our million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors virtually carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate approximately of principal have in the money loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between basis points and basis points If current interest rate levels were assumed to remain the same the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin would be approximately and respectively based on those existing loan floors and average total earning assets during the year ended December During a period of rising short term interest rates we expect average funding costs which are not currently subject to contractual caps on the interest rate to rise while the yield on loans with interest rate floors would remain the same until those loans adjustable rate index caused coupon rates to exceed the loan rate floor The speed in which short term interest rates increase is expected to have a significant impact on net interest income from loans with interest rate floors Quickly rising short term rates would allow adjustable rate loans with floors to reprice to rates higher than the existing floor more quickly impacting net interest income less adversely than if short term rates rose slowly or deliberately Because a future increase in short term funding rates could cause a mismatch between floating rate loan yields and short term funding costs due to existing interest rate floors such positions are modeled and reviewed as part of our asset liability management strategy each quarter Current interest rate simulations based on more extreme rate scenarios such as short term rates up basis points combined with a flattening of the yield curve during a month period could reduce net interest income by to to after tax impacts per year during the first three years of the rate increase We seek to minimize this interest rate risk exposure in part by maintaining the fixed rate period of wholesale funding typically longer than the average term for local deposit funding Wholesale funding is approximately of total assets and carried an approximately month fixed rate term as of December Reinvestment yields for investment security cash flows remain very low and our securities portfolio yield is expected to continue to decline throughout as cash flows are reinvested in this low rate environment In addition loan yields are expected to decline slightly due to competitive pressures as banks seek to increase loan originations while quality credit demand remains weak These declines in earning asset rates are expected to be only partially offset by further declines in certificate of deposit funding costs and nonmaturity deposit costs with net interest margin anticipated to continue in a range of to during During the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act repealed the prohibition on paying interest on commercial checking accounts We currently provide an earnings credit against account fees in lieu of an interest payment and do not expect costs to increase because of this change in the short term Despite the law change we do not sell or promote an interest bearing commercial checking account at this time However the change could have greater long term implications as competitor banks begin to use premium interest rate levels on commercial deposits in attempts to raise deposits in coming years Also during President Obama s administration announced changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program HARP a program first initiated in March The original program was intended to allow homeowners to refinance their mortgages if they were current on payments and owed between and the value of their homes Because a limited number of borrowers took advantage of the plan HARP has now been expanded to allow current borrowers to refinance their mortgage no matter how far the mortgage exceeds the home value This change could impact the speed of prepayments experienced by investors such as us who hold mortgage related securities backed by borrowers who could benefit from program participation New or unexpected prepayment on mortgage related securities can impair unamortized purchase premiums paid to obtain high coupon investments in the existing low interest rate environment At December we held only three mortgage related securities with high loan coupons expected to be impacted by the HARP program changes Each of the securities carries an investment coupon of and is backed by year fixed rate mortgages issued between to Fair value of these securities was approximately of our total mortgage related security portfolio with an amortized cost of and yielding at December Because the securities were held at an aggregate unamortized purchase discount of accelerated purchase premium amortization for accelerated repayments do to the HARP program is not a concern However any prepayments on these or other mortgage related securities would be subject to reinvestment at much lower rates lowering future net interest income or reducing unrealized gains on securities currently held compared to Cost of funding continued to decline much faster than loan yields during as loan yields were supported by placement of interest rate floors on floating rate loans Tax adjusted net interest income increased during with net interest margin increasing to from in The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate Table of Contents Impacts during and

loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate approximately of principal had in the money loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between basis points and basis points If those prior year rates were assumed to remain the same the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately and respectively based on those existing loan floors and total earning assets for the year ended December compared to Cost of funding declined much faster than loan yields during in part due to systematic insertion of loan interest rate floors upon renewal during the year Tax adjusted net interest income increased nearly during with net interest margin increasing to from in The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor basis points greater than the normal adjustable

Tax adjusted net interest income increased or to during compared to in An increase in average earning assets changes in volume contributed of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed of the increase As short term interest rates continued to fall during yields on adjustable rate loans tied to the prime and day LIBOR rates had the potential to reprice at very low yields To avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market we began to systematically insert interest rate floors on commercial related adjustable rate loans and residential mortgage home equity lines of credit upon renewal At December approximately of our million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors approximately carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor The weighted average amount in which actual loan yields were supported by the in the money loan rate floor was approximately basis points on million of adjustable rate loans at December The annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately and respectively based on these existing loan floors and total average earning assets for the year ended December if interest rates were assumed to remain the same Table of Contents Net interest income during benefited from incremental investment income from a leveraged security purchase completed late in In the transaction we purchased approximately in mortgage backed securities funded by of a mix of floating rate and fixed rate structured repurchase agreement funding The initial spread on the transaction was at closing During an increase in credit spreads on mortgage related products combined with falling short term rates worked together to increase the transaction spread to an average of during compared to an average spread of during This transaction added approximately in additional net interest income during compared to and approximately of total gross leveraged investment net interest income during Details on the structure of the related purchase agreements can be found in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The funding source for this leverage security transaction reset from a short term floating rate to a long term fixed rate late in reducing the current transaction spread to less than The decline in transaction spread reduced net interest income from this arrangement by approximately compared to By December spread on the transaction had declined to and was not a significant contributor to net interest income during As investment security yields continue to fall while the related funding source remains fixed we expect the transaction to produce a small amount of negative spread or loss to net interest income during and likely through when of the funding matures Interest Rate Sensitivity We incur market risk primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates We actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure The measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments such as loans and deposits is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated and the resulting net positions are identified Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital while adjusting the asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure We rely primarily on our asset liability structure reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to control interest rate risk In general longer term earning assets are funded by shorter term funding sources allowing us to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates However a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed to the same extent or on the same basis We do not engage in significant trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes Our overall strategy is to coordinate the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of interest rate movement on the net interest margin Table represents our earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates at December It is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment particularly during periods when the interest yield curve is flattening or steepening The following repricing methodologies should be noted Public or government fund MMDA and NOW accounts are considered fully repriced within days Higher yielding retail and non governmental money market and NOW deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within days Rewards Checking NOW accounts and lower rate money market deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within one year Other NOW and savings accounts are considered core deposits as they are generally insensitive to interest rate changes These core deposits are generally considered to reprice beyond five years Nonaccrual loans are considered to reprice beyond years Assets and liabilities with contractual calls or prepayment options are repriced according to the likelihood of the call or prepayment being exercised in the current interest rate environment Measurements taking into account the impact of rising or falling interest rates are based on a parallel yield curve change that is fully implemented within a month time horizon Bank owned life insurance is considered to reprice beyond years Table reflects an asset sensitive positive gap position during the next year with a cumulative one year gap ratio as of December of compared to a negative gap liability sensitive position of at December In general a current positive gap position would be favorable in a rising rate environment but unfavorable in a falling rate environment However net interest income is impacted not only by the timing of product repricing but the extent of the change in pricing which could be severely limited from local competitive pressures This factor can result in changes to net interest income from changing interest rates different than expected from review of the gap table Table of Contents Table Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

at risk A formal liquidity contingency plan exists that directs management to the least expensive liquidity sources to fund sudden and unanticipated liquidity needs Refer to the section labeled LIQUIDITY contained in this Annual Report on Form K We also use various policy measures to assess interest rate risk as described below Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Limits We balance the need for liquidity with the opportunity for increased net interest income available from longer term loans held for investment and securities To measure the impact on net interest income from interest rate changes we model interest rate simulations on a quarterly basis Our policy is that projected net interest income over the next months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points Table presents the projected impact to net interest income by certain rate change scenarios and the change to the one year cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities Table Net Interest Margin Rate Simulation Impacts As of December Cumulative year gap ratio Base Up Down Change in Net Interest Income Year Up during the year Down during the year Change in Net Interest Income Year No rate change base case Following up in year Following down in year Note Simulations after December reflect net interest income changes from a down basis point scenario rather than a down basis point scenario To assess whether interest rate sensitivity beyond one year helps mitigate or exacerbate the short term rate sensitive position a quarterly measure of core funding utilization is made Core funding is defined as liabilities with a maturity in excess of months and capital Core deposits including DDA NOW and non maturity savings accounts except high yield NOW such as Rewards Checking deposits and money market accounts are also considered core long term funding sources The core funding utilization ratio is defined as assets that reprice in excess of months divided by core funding Our target for the core funding utilization ratio is to remain at or below given the same basis point changes in rates that apply to the guidelines for interest rate risk limits exposure described previously Our core funding utilization ratio after a projected basis point increase in rates was at December compared to and at December and respectively This ratio declined during due to a decrease in the average life within the investment security portfolio combined with an increase in the core deposit categories noted above The high level of the core funding utilization ratio at December in the up basis point scenario was due to projected extension in principal payments on residential mortgage loans held in the loan portfolio as well as residential mortgage related securities held in the investment securities portfolio At December in the up basis point scenario securities and loan principal to reprice in years or longer increased approximately or Over of this change was due to changes related to residential mortgage loans or related securities Although above the internal target of this level was considered manageable and monitored quarterly Table of Contents At December internal interest rate simulations that project interest rate changes that maintain the current shape of the yield curve often referred to as parallel yield curve shifts estimated relatively small projected changes to future years net interest income even in more extreme periods of interest rate changes such as up basis points during a month period However if interest rates were to increase more quickly than anticipated and if the yield curve flattened at the same time such as in a flat up basis point change occurring during net interest income would decline during the first three years of the simulation in amounts ranging from to of the base simulation s net interest income to per year When the yield curve flattens repriced short term funding cost such as for terms of one year or less increases while maturing fixed rate balloon loans such as with terms from to years increase much less During flattening periods assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but to a much different extent Current net interest income sensitivity to a rising and flattening yield curve is similar to that seen at December when similar flat up basis point projections indicated net interest income would decline during the first two years of the simulation in amounts ranging from to of the base simulation s net interest income While not expected during in future years interest rates could rise to levels significantly greater than today and exhibit a flattening interest yield curve To minimize such interest rate risk we typically extend the average fixed term of our wholesale funding portfolio of brokered certificates and FHLB advances Extending such funding may decrease net interest income in the current environment since funding with short term interest rate costs would be less expensive but does provide additional protection against rising interest rates in future years At December the average fixed rate term of the wholesale funding portfolio was months During we expect the average fixed term of the wholesale portfolio to decline in anticipation of an extended period of low interest rates and to better manage net interest income in an extended low rate environment Wholesale funding was of total assets at December Although the flat up basis points simulation is projected to negatively impact net interest income we have significant risk to a prolonged period of low or falling rates in the already low rate environment In this situation loan and security yields continue to decline while funding costs reach effective lows reducing net interest margin particularly if average credit spreads were to decline to levels seen prior to pre recessionary levels In the down basis point scenario in the December income simulations net interest income is projected to decline as follows compared to the current base rate scenario Year Year Year Year Year Despite recent rate volatility and periodic continued declines in market interest rates management does not consider such a protracted low interest rate environment to be likely but continues to monitor its asset liability position in light of this potential long term risk to net interest income levels Investment Securities Portfolio The investment securities portfolio is intended to provide us with adequate liquidity flexible asset liability management and a source of stable income During all securities were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses were excluded from earnings but reported as other comprehensive income in a separate component of stockholders equity net of income tax However during the municipal security portfolio and nonrated trust preferred securities and senior subordinated notes with fair value totaling including unrealized gain of were transferred from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity These securities were transferred to better reflect our intent and practice to hold these long term securities until maturity and to minimize potential volatility to stockholders equity from future changes in unrealized gains and losses in a rising interest rate environment As securities held to maturity changes in unrealized gains and losses after the transfer date are not reflected in stockholders equity and these securities are recorded at amortized cost The original unrealized gain of on the security transfer date is being amortized against the new cost basis equal to transfer date fair value over the remaining life of the securities Table presents the fair value

including Johnson Financial Group Inc River Valley Bancorporation Inc and Northern Bankshares Inc The non rated senior subordinated notes were issued by McFarland State Bank a subsidiary of Northern Bankshares Inc After a significant loss during Johnson Financial Group Inc elected to defer payments of interest on their trust preferred security issue causing us to classify the par value investment as a nonperforming asset During the owners of Johnson Financial Group entered into an agreement with regulators to recapitalize the bank significantly improving its capital position and stability We cannot predict when Johnson Financial Group may resume payment of interest on this issue and we intend to classify it as nonperforming until interest payments begin We regularly review the financial performance of Johnson Financial Group and the other banks associated with our trust preferred and senior subordinated note investments None of the securities were considered other than temporarily

securities available for sale recorded as a component of stockholders equity was net of deferred taxes of at December Unrealized securities gains and losses net of income tax effects do not impact the level of regulatory capital under current banking regulations We believe investment security yields have a stabilizing effect on net interest margin during periods of interest rate swings and expect to hold existing securities until maturity or repayment unless such funds are needed for liquidity due to unexpected loan growth or depositor withdrawals or if the sale is beneficial to our interest rate risk and return profile Periods of rising interest rates would likely decrease the unrealized fair value of fixed rate securities in our portfolio During we expect to reinvest maturing securities cash flow into securities with average lives generally between to years and to minimize growth in our municipal securities portfolio whose securities have fixed terms generally from to years These actions are designed to reduce our interest rate and market risks inherent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at this time In addition agency securities are considered to be a higher quality collateral asset for pledging purposes than municipal securities which increases contingency liquidity sources compared to During fair value of investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions as shown in Table increased or while agency mortgage related securities increased or and agency debentures declined or Agency debentures matured during a period of very low reinvestment

based on original amortized cost trended higher for most of as falling market reinvestment rates improved the value of fixed rate securities already held in our portfolio However transfer of the municipal security portfolio during from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity increased the amortized cost basis to the fair value of the securities at the time of transfer Following the transfer longer term interest rates increased which caused fair value of fixed rate municipal securities to fall below their new book value At December fair value was of amortized cost

occupied retail sales space Approximately of fully disbursed commercial real estate loans excluding construction and development loans are considered to be owner occupied at December We have little lending activity for agricultural purposes Our management is involved in the communities we serve and believes it has a strong understanding of the local economy its business leaders and trends in successful business development Based on this knowledge we offer flexible terms and efficient approvals which have allowed us to grow and manage this type of lending As part of the asset liability and interest rate sensitivity management strategy we generally do not retain long term to year fixed rate mortgages in our own portfolio Therefore it is our practice to sell the majority of long term fixed rate mortgage loan originations to secondary market agencies in exchange for a fee From time to time we retain second mortgage loans on certain high value homes requiring total financing above the conforming secondary market limit after selling the first mortgage into the secondary market In addition some local borrowers require mortgage financing that does not fit one of the secondary market programs cannot qualify for secondary market financing because they cannot obtain a qualifying appraisal due to lack of comparable sales or the borrower prefers us to hold the loan in our own portfolio First and second mortgage loans on the balance sheet generally carry fixed rate balloon payment terms of five years or less Consumer and individual loans include short term personal loans automobile and recreational vehicle installment loans and credit card loans We experience extensive competition from local credit unions offering low rates on installment loans and therefore direct resources toward more profitable lending categories such as residential fixed rate mortgages and commercial real estate lending However due to income tax advantages many customers borrow on a tax deductible home equity line of credit for many purposes formerly funded by a consumer installment loan Therefore we consider consumer purpose lending to be represented by the combination of consumer and individual lending and residential mortgage home equity Table of Contents compared to Loans held for investment continue to consist primarily of commercial related loans including commercial and

debt in our markets In addition large regional banks in our markets including BMO Harris Bank who during acquired M I Bank s market leading share position are aggressively pursuing loan growth with our market s highest credit quality customers with low loan coupon rates and spreads These actions could keep loan growth levels low during or contribute to a decline in our net interest margin as we

combined with real estate construction and development loans commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased at December compared to December The decline in commercial real estate loans was due in part to work out of a problem construction and development loan with a loan balance of at December that was resolved in with net amounts transferred to foreclosed assets of The transfer represented of all loan principal transferred to foreclosed assets during This decline was offset by a or increase in closed end residential mortgage loans Although we normally sell originations of long term fixed rate residential mortgages late in we retained of such loan originations with an average fully amortizing term of months and a fixed rate of using investment security cash flows due to very low security reinvestment rates All construction and land development loans including commercial and family residential construction loan commitments were approximately of total loans receivable at

credit risk Our process for monitoring credit risk includes quarterly analysis of loan quality delinquencies nonperforming assets and potential problem loans An allowance for loan losses is maintained for incurred losses inherent but yet unidentified in the loan portfolio due to past conditions as well as for specifically identified problem loans The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio based on current economic conditions Provisions to the allowance for loan losses are recorded as a reduction

loan portfolio past loan loss experience trends in past due and nonperforming loans existing economic conditions loss exposure by loan category and estimated future losses on specifically identified problem loans We have an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality Accordingly the amount charged to expense is based on our multi factor evaluation of the loan portfolio It is our policy that when available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof including impaired loans are uncollectible these amounts are promptly charged off against the allowance In addition to coverage from the allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans are secured by various collateral including business real estate and consumer collateral Loans charged off

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed based on credit quality and other pertinent loan portfolio information The adequacy of the allowance and the provision for loan losses is consistent with the composition of the loan portfolio and recent internal credit quality assessments We maintain our headquarters and one branch location in the City of Wausau Wisconsin and maintain the majority of our deposits including five of our eight locations and loan customers in Marathon County Wisconsin During the Marathon County Wisconsin unemployment rate declined from in December to in December Late in two large local manufacturing employers located in Marathon County announced local factory closures which were reported to eliminate approximately jobs a significant amount in our local economy It is possible the unemployment rate will increase and remain elevated during The annualized level of loan loss provision during is expected to be similar to the level recorded during although loss on foreclosed assets is expected to decline during compared to the prior year Future provisions will be impacted by the actual amount of impaired and other problem loans identified by internal procedures or regulatory agencies In addition fair value of existing foreclosed assets continue to be reviewed in light of recent local market data and may be subject to a further write down of value during Loans are placed on a nonaccrual status when they become contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments All interest accrued but not collected for loans

historical losses by category The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio Management allocates the allowance for loan losses by pools of risk and by loan type We combine estimates of the allowance needed for loans analyzed individually and loans analyzed on a pool basis The determination of allocated reserves for larger commercial loans involves a review of individual higher risk transactions focused on loan grading and assessment of projected cash flows and possible resolutions of problem credits While we use available information to recognize losses on loans future adjustments may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and future impacts to specific borrowers Table of Contents The majority of gross loan charge offs during were related

Impaired loans Totals During the March quarter we underwent a comprehensive update of our process to categorize impaired loans estimate the related allowance for loan losses on impaired loans and estimate inherent losses on other portfolio loans not considered to be impaired This review did not significantly increase or decrease the amount of allowance for loan losses required on the bank wide portfolio compared to our previous method of estimating loss allowances However our new method did allocate a greater amount of the reserve to impaired loans During we streamlined internal criteria to classify a loan as impaired which now includes all nonaccrual loans all restructured loans whether performing or not and other loans with the potential to become nonaccrual or restructured in the next year Prior to impaired loans were generally defined to include larger commercial purpose loans only and did not include all nonaccrual or restructured loans Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the loan loss activity by loan category during and Nonperforming loans are defined as loans days or more past due but still accruing nonaccrual loans including those defined as impaired under current accounting standards and restructured loans Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments Previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed and future payments received are applied in full to reduce remaining loan principal No income is accrued or recorded on future payments until the loan is returned to accrual status Upon return to accrual status the interest portion of past payments that were applied to reduce nonaccrual principal is taken back into income The interest that would have been reported in if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately in comparison to actually recorded in income The interest that would have been reported in if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately in comparison to actually recorded in income The interest that would have been reported in if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately in comparison to actually recorded in income Troubled debt restructured loans TDR are also included in nonperforming loans Restructured loans involve the granting of concessions to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate or capitalization of unpaid real estate taxes or unpaid interest that the lender would not normally grant The majority of restructured loans represent conversion of amortizing commercial purpose loans to interest only loans for a temporary period to increase the problem borrower s cash flow The remaining restructured loans granted a lower interest rate to borrowers for a temporary period to increase borrower operating cash flow Such loans are subject to management review and ongoing monitoring and are made in cases where the borrower s delinquency is considered short term from circumstances the borrower is believed able to overcome or which would reduce our estimated total credit loss on the relationship Nonaccrual loans including nonaccrual restructured loans remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated Therefore some borrowers continue to make substantially all required payments while maintained on non accrual status Table of Contents Substantially all of our residential mortgage loans originated for and held in our loan portfolio were based on conventional and long standing underwriting criteria and are secured by first mortgages on homes in our local markets We were not an originator of higher risk loans such as option ARM products high loan to value ratio mortgages interest only loans subprime loans or loans with initial teaser rates that can have a greater risk of non collection than other loans At December approximately million of loans receivable were family home equity or junior lien mortgage loans in which the maximum commitment amount of the line of credit plus existing senior liens is greater than of the underlying real estate value or were a loan in a rd mortgage position or lower compared to million at December Such loans were not originated as part of a program to add higher yielding loans to our portfolio but were loans made on a case by case basis and individually underwritten with the borrower customized to their need We do not maintain a formal residential mortgage modification program for delinquent residential mortgage borrowers At December the inherent credit loss allocation on non problem open ended home equity lines of credit was of loan principal compared to during and to reflect the risk of future credit losses

security issued by Johnson Financial Group total nonperforming assets increased or to at December After when the decline in local economic conditions stabilized the local economy remained slow to recover which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms At December the unemployment rate was in Wisconsin and in Marathon County the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from at December compared to a rate of for the United States During we expect restructured loans to increase as we work with problem borrowers to minimize the level of potential future charge offs and maximize cumulative total principal repayment In addition regulatory pressures and a change in generally accepted accounting principles regarding identification of restructured loans are likely to increase loans disclosed as troubled debt restructurings Although some restructured loans may continue on accrual status the restructured designation would still increase total nonperforming loans and could increase the provision for loan losses Table of Contents Approximately of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties

were sold at auction at a loss of excluding a previously expensed auction marketing fee The remaining foreclosed asset was further written down to an estimated fair value of at December for total valuation losses on the property of during when including the marketing fee During one of the four remaining individual properties was sold and the entire sale proceeds were applied to reduce cost basis of the remaining properties During the remaining properties were further written down an additional due to declining real estate values for this type of vacation property As shown in Table three properties remain with cost basis of at December During the northern Wisconsin area where these properties are located experienced few vacation property transactions in excess of million such as would be appropriate for this foreclosed property We actively market these remaining properties for sale but cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset Table of Contents During we entered into a restructuring agreement on a commercial real estate loan with a local developer and owner of multi family apartment complexes to extend the amortization period on existing debt to increase cash flow available to the developer to meet real estate tax and other obligations At December this debt as reflected in Table is maintained on accrual status and no reduction in stated interest rate was made in the modification We obtained a new collateral appraisal during which indicated the property value has declined We estimated various scenarios for future borrower payments on this loan including a liquidation scenario in the current environment Based on our analysis a allowance for loan losses was maintained against the loan at December During we restructured the loan terms on of loan principal to lower the interest rate on existing debt with a borrower in the cabinetry contracting industry to increase cash flow during a large decline in customer sales During the borrower sold the business to a competitor but retained a mortgage on the production facility which is leased to the new owner and gave a purchase option within three years to the new business owner We expect the new owner to exercise the purchase option near the end of the three year term The remaining principal is maintained on accrual status and reflected in Table at December Based on projected cash flows to be received from our borrower from rental payments received by the new business owner we maintained a allowance for loan losses at December compared to a loan loss reserve of in the prior year During we were informed by Johnson Financial Capital Trust of its intent to defer payment of interest on its trust preferred capital debentures Johnson Financial Group is the holding company for Johnson Bank headquartered in Racine Wisconsin and is the second largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin Our investment in the debentures was placed on nonaccrual status and no interest income was recorded during Later in the family ownership of Johnson Financial Group agreed with regulators to recapitalize the bank with approximately million in equity capital The new capital is expected to be fully contributed to the bank by Our internal evaluation has determined this investment is not other than temporarily impaired and no charge against net income for impairment has been recorded During we restructured an owner occupied commercial real estate loan with a local insurance agent The building was constructed during and included additional space to rent to unrelated service businesses The debt was restructured to extend the amortization period to support declining borrower cash flow as portions of the building remained vacant The restructured loan continues to be maintained on accrual status The loan is reflected in Table at December We obtained a new collateral appraisal during which identified that the value of the property had declined We estimated various cash payment scenarios from the borrower including cash flow in connection with a liquidation and sale under current market conditions We maintained an allowance for loan losses against this loan of at December During we restructured a loan secured by an owner occupied restaurant to increase borrower cash flow and allow the business to continue operating During the borrower s residential mortgage loan was also classified as a nonperforming loan which increased net nonperforming principal by to at December The loan is maintained on nonaccrual status and all payments received are used to lower the principal balance During of payments were received reducing the balance to as shown in Table A new collateral appraisal was obtained during and various cash flow scenarios were analyzed including liquidation of the collateral under current market conditions At December an allowance for loan losses of was maintained against this credit compared to the allowance maintained at December We cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this problem loan During we entered into a syndicated construction loan agreement sold by Bankers Bank Madison Wisconsin for construction of vacation condos and an adjacent water park near Hollister Missouri The construction loan was intended to be repaid by the proceeds from a municipal tax incremental financing debt issue by the local municipality When the credit markets for such financing dried up the project was unable to continue and land development work ceased The loan participants obtained the property in foreclosure during The original fair value estimate of the completed project was approximately million At the time of foreclosure we valued our asset using a new liquidation value appraisal based on our approximately ownership of the project resulting in a cost basis of at December and During a new appraisal identified a further decline in value and the loan was written down an additional to its new cost basis of as reflected in Table At this time we are unable to determine the final resolution of this property and further write downs of value could be required during when updated appraisals are obtained compared to The provision for loan losses was in compared to in Non performing loans relative to total loans declined slightly and was at December compared to at December However foreclosed assets increased from at December to at December Therefore total nonperforming assets were or of total assets at December compared to or of total assets at December During the decline in local economic conditions stabilized

during and charged off of loan principal Later in we recorded a further partial write down of for a remaining cost of as shown in Table During we sold the building and a significant portion of the vacant and recorded a loss on the sale of The remaining foreclosed property consists of vacant land with a balance at December We actively market this property for sale but at this time are unable to determine the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset We do not expect further significant losses on resolution of the foreclosed asset During our borrower in the building supplies industry ceased payments on a loan secured by construction inventory and accounts receivable in part due to uncollected large accounts receivable due to a dispute between our customer and the account payer During we collected in payments which were applied to principal which totaled as shown in Table Due to poor collateral position we reserved against the loan relationship at December which was

noninterest income compared to Total noninterest income during was compared to in a decrease of or During service fees declined or due to lower customer usage of our courtesy overdraft program and related overdraft fees in response to new regulation concerning this product effective in August The new regulation requires that certain payments by consumers who did not opt into the bank s overdraft program are not paid by the bank reducing overdraft fee income In addition the new regulation and negative publicity concerning banks and their overdraft protection programs continue to lower customer usage of the product and we could see further service fee income declines during related to overdrafts In addition mortgage banking income declined or as residential mortgage rates began to settle at historically low levels during Offsetting these declines was commission income on sale of fixed interest rate swaps to commercial adjustable rate loan customers of during The swap product was a new product during and is included in other operating income in Table above Certain commercial customers with adjustable rate loans with us may choose to enter into an interest rate swap with us to convert their floating rate interest payments to a fixed rate We simultaneously sell these fixed rate hedge contracts to a correspondent bank in exchange for a fee Table of Contents During the Federal Reserve finalized regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act related to debit card interchange income often referred to as the Durbin Amendment These new changes cap the amount of debit card interchange income that may be collected by large banks from merchants for processing card activity While the new rules technically do not apply to us as a smaller bank the impacts are expected to become uniform for the industry over time as merchants use their new authority and options to process customer card activity across a wider number of providers While the timing is uncertain these fully implemented changes could lower our annualized debit card interchange revenue by approximately down approximately from revenue levels prior to the regulatory change In general the banking industry has begun to respond to lower debit card fee revenue by reducing customer account reward programs and related costs and increasing account service fees We continue to investigate the nature and timing of potential future retail checking account changes in response to the expected reduction of debit card income Many important sources of noninterest income are impacted by recent and coming federal regulation including overdraft service fee income and debit card income as noted previously In addition the prolonged period of declining residential mortgage rates is gradually lowering the level of mortgage refinanced activity In addition we discontinued selling the Rewards Checking NOW product during which rewarded customers for higher levels of debit card activity We expect lower usage of debit cards due to this change Because we expect overdraft income debit card income and mortgage income to decline during we expect total noninterest income to decline during compared to compared to During total noninterest income declined or to compared to during However excluding nonrecurring net gains losses on security sales noninterest income increased or compared to Although mortgage banking income declined as more borrowers refinanced their residential mortgages when rates fell significantly during compared to several other types of income experienced significant increases For example service charge income increased or from higher overdraft fee income and investment and insurance sales commissions increased or from higher gross sales activity Prior to new regulation which lowered overdraft activity the bank had rolled out an updated courtesy overdraft product early in which increased year over year overdraft income and service fee income despite the regulatory change Lastly interchange income from credit and debit cards increased or during compared to Many of the increases in were in areas expected to be impacted by continued regulatory changes including overdraft fees and card interchange income Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in due to increased Rewards Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account We discontinued selling the Rewards Checking account to new customers in which is likely to decrease debit card interchange income in future years New consumer banking regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve concerning customer overdraft programs went into effect during August The new regulation prevents banks from assessing an overdraft fee related to a transaction conducted at a point of sale such as those using a debit card unless the consumer has specifically opted into the program From the effective date of the regulation to the end of we experienced an approximately reduction in gross overdraft activity compared to activity prior to the regulatory change Prior to bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance However limited further investments in this asset class are expected compared to Noninterest income excluding gain loss on sale of securities increased during from a record year of mortgage banking income totaling up over as customers refinanced their long term fixed rate residential mortgages Residential loan principal sold to the secondary market during was approximately times and times the levels seen during and respectively This activity was promoted by historically low long term mortgage rates During total noninterest income was compared to during an increase of or The most significant components of the change include a

deposit losses Dodd Frank legislation effective during changed the method in which deposit insurance premiums are calculated Premium levels are now assessed based on net assets after deducting Tier regulatory capital rather than being assessed based on the level of deposits held The effect of this change was to transfer a greater portion of total industry deposit insurance premiums to the nation s largest banks as they typically maintain a lower percentage of deposits to assets compared to smaller banks like us Debit card losses were higher in due to sustaining a net loss from a concentrated fraud involving certain of our customer accounts Salaries and employee benefits declined or from in to in due primarily to an decrease in health and dental insurance expense During data processing expenses increased or compared to due to outsourced data processing costs associated with the new computer system placed in service during June However occupancy and facilities expense declined during

conversion related costs incurred during the first year of using the new system During wages and benefits are expected to increase minimally with average base pay increases of granted January compared to average base pay increases of granted for Although less than seen during employee incentive costs remained historically high as net income exceeded the target Depending on net income growth during such increased incentives may not recur potentially reducing employee costs For example if our net income was the same as in incentive costs could decline to during compared to Health and dental insurance costs are incurred under a self insured plan subject to a maximum stop loss Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information We expect health and dental

FDIC insurance assessment totaling Prior to the special assessment FDIC insurance expense increased or Offsetting the decline in FDIC expense was an increase in data processing and other office operations expense of or due to a change in core processing computer system during June from an internally maintained system to an outsourced vendor system Following the June conversion date the

Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was during compared to in and in The and effective rates increased as the percentage of tax exempt income from securities and bank owned life insurance declined relative to total pre tax income Tax exempt interest on securities and bank owned life insurance reduced tax expense by in in and during These reductions represented and of tax expense at the statutory tax rate during and respectively The reductions have come from higher levels of pretax income during and combined with lower tax exempt yields on municipal securities and life insurance as long term rates declined in the overall market Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax information Due to declining average reinvestment rates on tax exempt municipal securities we expect the effective tax rate to increase slightly during compared to The effective tax rate increased over from a change in State of Wisconsin income tax law to a combined reporting model This change subjected investment income earned on investment securities held by PSB Investments Inc Peoples State Bank s investment subsidiary to state income taxes Previously income on these investments was not subject to Wisconsin income taxes This change in taxation method increased our provision for income taxes by during compared to The effective tax rate would have been without the state tax regulation change Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses As noted previously during the quarter ended March we changed our methodology to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses The changes were made in response to several regulatory and industry factors including greater transparency in allowance and loss activity by loan segment and class greater reliance on various external and internal factors to determine contingency reserves on loans not considered to be impaired and greater reliance on estimates of future cash flows on impaired loans to estimate required allowances with lesser reliance on impaired loan collateral fair value to determine required allowances Current accounting standards call for the allowance for loan losses to include both specific losses on identified impaired problem loans and inherent contingent losses on existing loan pools not yet considered problem loans Determination of the allowance for loan losses at period end is based primarily on subjective factors and management assessment of risk in the existing portfolio Actual results if significantly different from those using estimates at period end could have a material impact on the results of operations For example losses incurred on loans not previously identified as carrying significant loss potential would increase the provision for loan losses expense equal to the amount of the loan principal charged off Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on allocation of the allowance for loan losses between different credit risk categories and for impaired loans as well as our system to review changes in credit risk on individual loans Loans receivable for the purpose of estimating the allowance for loan losses are separated into loan categories Performing loans categories all of which are assigned inherent loss reserves Residential mortgages Home equity lines of credit Consumer and individual loans Commercial real estate loans credit risk grades high quality through grade acceptable risk Commercial and industrial loans grades through Problem loans assigned inherent loss reserves categories Commercial real estate loans grade watch and grade substandard loans Commercial and industrial loans grade watch and grade substandard loans Impaired loans assigned specific reserves categories Commercial real estate loans grade impaired Commercial and industrial loans grade impaired Residential mortgage consumer and other personal loans grade impaired Commercial purpose loans are subcategorized into the credit risk grades based on an internal determination of risk established during credit analysis and updated no less than annually Determination of risk grades takes into account several factors including collateral cash flow borrower s industry environment financial statement strength and other factors Identified impaired problem loans under current accounting standards are classified into the lowest quality risk grade grade Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans loans identified as restructurings of troubled debt and loans accruing interest with elevated risk of default in the near term based on a variety of credit factors Table of Contents Inherent loss reserves are assigned as a percentage of estimated loss on principal within each category and are based on the following historical and subjective factors Weighted average historical net charge off of principal by category during the past quarters Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of external factors including changes in economic conditions changes in nature volume of portfolio changes in collateral values changes in regulatory requirements and changes in peer data Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of internal factors including changes in bank policies changes in underwriting criteria changes in volume of past due loans changes in internal local review processes and management turnover Inherent loss reserves for loans categories graded watch and grade substandard are provided additional contingency reserves beyond those described above to reflect the emerging credit risk represented by loans within these categories These additional contingency reserves are based on the average specific reserves calculated for impaired loans by category at period end Grade watch loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category Grade substandard loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category Specific reserves are calculated on each individual borrower by estimating future cash flows associated with borrower payments and foreclosure value of collateral associated with the loan Cash flows expected from foreclosure of collateral are discounted for closing costs and based on estimated current collateral and property values Estimated cash flows are discounted by the loan contract rate to determine the present value of future cash flows For loans considered to be restructurings of trouble debt the cash flows are discounted using the loan contract rate in place prior to any loan modifications Loans considered collateral dependent are assigned reserves based on the net cash value of collateral without consideration of discounted estimated cash flows After calculating the estimate of required allowances for loan losses using the steps above a further subjective analysis of current and projected economic conditions problem loan trends and other factors may cause additional unallocated reserves to be recorded to reflect this additional risk of loss before it is recognized by the change in commercial credit risk grades or the increase in the historical inherent loss percentage assigned to loan categories As of December and no unallocated loan loss allowances were recorded Estimates of inherent losses on non problem loans are a significant accounting estimate due to the many economic and subjective factors involved in estimating future losses based on existing negative factors associated with unidentified future problem loans currently making payments Reliance on historical charge off activity and subjective factors related to external and internal factors is expected to increase volatility in allowance for loan losses which could increase volatility in quarterly net income as conditions change and increase or decrease the existing allowance for loan losses For example if the actual inherent losses on the five performing loan categories evaluated using inherent loss estimates as described above were greater than those currently applied to meet reserve needs the December allowance for loan losses would have increased and have decreased net income by approximately after income taxes In addition an unexpected downgrade of loans classified grade watch and grade substandard to impaired status could significantly increase total allowance for loan losses as those downgraded loans are allocated allowances based on projected cash flow or collateral values on an individualized basis For example at December if all of the loans graded substandard and of loan principal graded watch were reclassified as impaired loans and experienced the average loss allocation currently reflected in the impaired loan portfolio the allowance for loan losses at December would have increased and decreased net income by approximately after income taxes Mortgage Servicing Rights As required by current accounting standards we record a mortgage servicing right asset MSR when we continue to service borrower payments and perform maintenance activities in exchange for an annual servicing fee of of average serviced mortgage principal on loans in which the principal has been sold to the FHLB or other secondary market investors Our initial value of servicing rights is calculated on an individual loan level basis and uses public financial market information for many of the significant estimates In the period in which the principal is sold to the secondary market investors we increase the gain on sale of the loan by the value of the initial MSR If the actual value was less than we recorded such as if the estimated future servicing period or average serviced principal was less than estimated the gain recorded on origination of the MSR would be overstated Recognition of impairment of excess mortgage servicing rights would decrease income causing our accounting for mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy For example if the actual value of initial MSR on secondary market sales were less than that recorded gain on sale of loans a component of mortgage banking income during would have declined approximately before income taxes In addition if the actual value of the entire December MSR were less than recorded net servicing revenue a component of mortgage banking income would have declined approximately before income taxes Table of Contents We make the following estimates and perform the following procedures when accounting for MSRs Serviced loans are stratified by risk of prepayment criteria Currently strata are first based on the year in which the loan was originated then on term and then on the range of interest rates within that term We use a discount approach to generate the initial value for the OMSR The calculation takes the average of the current dealer consensus on prepayment speeds as reported by Andrew Davidson Company or the prepayment speed implied in the mortgage backed security prices for newly created loans along with other assumptions to generate an estimate of future cash flows The present value of estimated cash flows equals the fair value of the OMSR We capitalize the lower of fair value or cost of the OMSR Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for significant fair value and cost estimates other than the estimate of public dealer consensus of prepayment speeds Changes in these estimates and assumptions would change the initial value recorded for OMSRs and change the gain on sale of mortgage loans recorded in the income statement Amortization of the OMSR is calculated based on actual payment activity on a per loan basis Because all loans are handled individually curtailments decrease MSRs as well as regularly scheduled payments The loan servicing value is amortized on a level yield basis Significant declines in current market mortgage interest rates decrease the fair value of existing MSRs due to the increase in anticipated prepayments above the original assumed speed Accounting standards require that impairment testing be performed and that MSRs be recorded at the lower of fair value or amortized cost We perform quarterly impairment testing on our MSRs Actual prepayment speeds based on our actual customer activity on a loan level basis are compared to the assumed prepayment speed on the date of the last quarterly impairment testing or the origination prepayment speed if a recently originated loan The fair value assumptions other than prepayment speed are combined with the new estimated prepayment speed to create a new fair value An impairment allowance is recorded for any shortfall between the new fair value and the original cost after adjusting for past amortization and curtailments LIQUIDITY Because total assets increased just or during the increase in core deposits up was used to pay down other borrowings by during while wholesale borrowings increased During the

Average CDARS balances declined as local municipalities that fueled growth seeking FDIC protection withdraw balances for operational needs as well as to invest in other deposit products outside the CDARS program For regulatory purposes these deposits are considered brokered deposits and disclosed as such on quarterly regulatory filings However for internal and external reporting other than for Call Report purposes these deposits are considered to be retail deposits since the terms of the account are set directly between us and our local customer on a retail basis Accordingly these deposits are included as Retail time deposits and over in the Tables in this section Total CDARS deposits totaled and at December and respectively Originally available under the TARP legislation passed by the federal government during and now required under the provisions of Dodd Frank we participated in the FDIC program which provided unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest bearing deposits in excess of

term national rates and an anticipated decline in debit card interchange income Retail time deposits less declined or during as rates paid on certificates of deposit in the current market approached those paid on money market and NOW accounts Therefore customers appeared to move funds out of time deposits into nonmaturity accounts that allowed them to access the funds without penalty such as when deposited into a time deposit Nonmaturity money market and NOW accounts increased during Table of Contents Rewards Checking was the primary driver of increased deposit growth since its introduction in June through December During this period Rewards Checking supplied approximately of our net core deposit growth During we grandfathered existing Rewards Checking customers but discontinued selling the product Rewards Checking operated as a traditional interest bearing checking account but paid a premium interest rate and reimbursement of foreign ATM fees if the customer meet certain account usage requirements In general the account required customers to use their debit card at least times per month deposit their employer paycheck via ACH and receive their periodic checking account statement via email from our home banking website The premium rewards annual percentage yield APY paid was and on the first of balances at December and respectively At December the premium rate paid was on the first of deposit balances The Rewards Checking interest rate is adjustable at our discretion but was intended to provide the highest potential retail deposit rate product available to customers The debit card usage requirement substantially increased the amount of debit card interchange income through as described previously under the section titled Noninterest income Prior to the incremental all in cost of Rewards Checking deposits was less than wholesale funding alternatives and was believed to be a long term cost effective source of funds in addition to providing PSB with a competitive advantage in the retail banking environment and greater control over the repricing of local deposits in a rising rate environment Rewards Checking balances were and at December and respectively The average interest cost of Rewards Checking balances excluding debit card interchange fees savings from delivery of electronic periodic statements and vendor software costs of maintaining the program was in compared to in and in Average balances in Rewards Checking are expected to remain between million and million during Changes to debit card interchange income contained in Dodd Frank and proposed by the Federal Reserve were anticipated to have a dramatic impact to the profitability of Rewards Checking We are currently evaluating other product options attractive to our customers that meet market needs and minimize our operating expenses and servicing costs in light of reduced interchange income These products could replace Rewards Checking or be priced in a manner more attractive than Rewards Checking in light of the potential decrease to debit card interchange income Because Rewards Checking deposit growth has been the significant driver of local deposit growth in past years changes to this account structure could reduce future deposit growth Although government deposits grew significantly during from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account nonmaturity government balances continued a decline of or to at December after a decline of or to at December compared to December As loan growth slowed significantly during we reduced the high yield

customers making up approximately of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December Many of the balances at year end were seasonal deposits and expected to be withdrawn during the first several months of In light of the seasonal nature of many large accounts at year end and expected low organic loan growth during we expect small increases to local deposit growth in our existing markets during compared to Local core deposits increased up at December compared December An increase in commercial money market funds of or led the increase in deposits The increase of

largest customers making up approximately of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December Many of the balances at year end were seasonal deposits and were withdrawn during the first several months of Wholesale Funding Sources and Available Liquidity Our asset liability management process provides a unified approach to management of liquidity capital and interest rate risk as well as providing adequate funds to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flow of our customers We view liquidity as the ability to raise cash at a reasonable cost or with a minimum of loss and as a measure of balance sheet flexibility to react to marketplace regulatory and competitive changes Table of Contents The primary short term and long term funding sources we use other than retail deposits include federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks repurchase agreements from security pledging advances from the FHLB use of wholesale time deposits and advances taken from the Federal Reserve s Discount Window Table outlines the available and unused portion of these funding sources based on collateral and or company policy limitations as of December and Currently unused but available funding sources along with a significant amount of overnight liquid funds at December are considered sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth We maintain formal policies to address liquidity contingency needs and to manage a liquidity crisis Table provides a summary of how the wholesale funding sources normally available to us would be impacted by various operating conditions Table Environmental Impacts on Availability of Wholesale Funding Sources Normal Moderately Highly Operating Stressed Stressed Environment Environment Environment Repurchase

Repurchase agreements and other FHLB advances Wholesale and national deposits Holding company secured line of credit Totals Funding as a percent of total assets The following discussion examines each of the available but unused funding sources listed in the table above and the factors that may directly or indirectly influence the timing or the amount ultimately available to us compared to Overnight federal funds purchased Our aggregate federal funds purchased availability of is from three correspondent banks The most significant portion of the total is from our primary correspondent bank Bankers Bank located in Madison Wisconsin an increase from at December We make regular use of the Bankers Bank line as part of our normal daily cash settlement procedures but rarely have used the lines offered by the other two correspondent banks Federal funds must be repaid each day and borrowings may be renewed for up to consecutive business days To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line we need to maintain a composite ratio as defined by Bankers Bank of or less Bankers Bank defines the composite ratio to be nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets divided by tangible capital including the allowance for loan losses calculated at our subsidiary bank level Due to existence of the composite ratio an increase in nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets could impact availability of the line or subject us to further review In addition a rising composite ratio could cause our other two correspondent banks to reconsider their federal funds line with us since they do not also serve as our primary correspondent bank Our subsidiary bank s composite ratio was approximately and at December and December respectively and less than the benchmark used by Bankers Bank Table of Contents Federal Reserve discount window advances We have a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Discount Window supported by a pledge of both commercial and commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve under their Borrower in Custody BIC program During the annualized interest rate applicable to Discount Window advances was Under the BIC program we provide a monthly listing of detailed loan information on the loans provided as collateral We are subject to annual review and certification by the Federal Reserve to retain participation in the program The Discount Window represents the primary source of liquidity on a daily basis following our federal funds purchased lines of credit discussed above We were limited to a maximum advance of and at December and December respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged Discount Window advances must be repaid or renewed each day No Discount Window advances were used during Only performing loans are permitted as collateral under the BIC and each individual loan is subject to a haircut to collateral value based on the Federal Reserve s review of the listing each month In general approximately of the loan principal offered as collateral is able to support Discount Window advances Similar to the federal funds purchased lines of credit an increase in nonperforming loans would decrease the amount of collateral available for Discount Window advances Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances We maintain an available line of credit with the FHLB of Chicago based on a pledge of to family mortgage loan collateral both first and secondary lien positions We may borrow on the line to the lesser of the blanket mortgage lien collateral provided or times our existing FHLB capital stock investment Based on the our existing capital stock investment total FHLB advances in excess of require us to purchase additional FHLB stock equal to of the advance amount At December we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to of the available without the purchase of FHLB stock At December we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to of the available without the purchase of FHLB stock Further advances of the remaining available at December would have required us to purchase additional FHLB stock totaling FHLB stock pays a nominal dividend of with expectations of continuing this dividend level Therefore additional FHLB advances carry additional cost relative to other wholesale borrowing alternatives due to the requirement to hold low yielding FHLB stock Similar to the Discount Window only performing residential mortgage loans may be pledged to the FHLB under the blanket lien In addition we are subject to a haircut of approximately on first mortgage collateral and on secondary lien collateral at December and December The FHLB also conducts periodic audits of collateral identification and submission procedures and adjusts the collateral haircuts higher in response to negative exam findings The FHLB also assigns a credit risk grade to each member based on a quarterly review of the member s regulatory CALL report Our current credit risk is within the normal range for a healthy member bank Negative financial performance trends such as reduced capital levels increased nonperforming assets net operating losses and other factors can increase a member s credit risk grade Higher risk grades can require a member to provide detailed loan collateral listings rather than a blanket lien physical collateral and other restrictions on the maximum line usage FHLB advances are available on a daily basis and along with Discount Window advances represent a primary source of liquidity following our federal funds purchased lines of credit FHLB advances carry substantial penalties for early prepayment that are generally not recovered from the lower interest rates in refinancing The amount of early prepayment penalty is a function of the difference between the current borrowing rate and the rate currently available for refinancing Under a new collateral and pledging agreement we maintain with the FHLB effective April we are also permitted to pledge commercial related collateral for advances However we did not pledge any commercial loan collateral to the FHLB at December Recently the FHLB of Chicago announced a capital stock conversion plan effective January Under the plan existing member stock of which we currently hold million was restructured into two classes Under the capital conversion plan the FHLB repurchased of our stock in early Our remaining shares of were restructured and are considered B capital shares Excess holdings of B shares may be redeemed by the FHLB at the request of a member following a five year redemption period However a member must continue to hold capital stock no less than of outstanding FHLB advances Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Wholesale repurchase agreements may be available from a correspondent bank counterparty for both overnight and longer terms Such arrangements typically call for the agreement to be collateralized by us at of the repurchase principal In the current market repurchase counterparty providers are extremely limited and would likely require a minimum million transaction Repurchase agreements could require up to several business days to receive funding Due to the lack of availability of counterparties offering the product wholesale repurchase agreements are not a reliable source of liquidity At December million of our repurchase agreements are wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and million are overnight repurchase agreements with local customers using our treasury management services At December million of our repurchase agreements were wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and million were overnight repurchase agreements with local customers Table of Contents In addition to availability of FHLB advances under the blanket mortgage lien we also have the ability to pledge investment securities as collateral against FHLB advances Advances secured by investments are also subject to the FHLB stock ownership requirement as described previously Due to the need to purchase additional FHLB member stock FHLB advances secured by investments are not considered a primary source of liquidity At December of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional of member capital stock were purchased At December of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional of member capital stock were purchased The amount available for pledging increased since December due to an increase in the securities portfolio in general and a decrease in local customer repurchase agreements which freed up security collateral for pledging to the FHLB Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position balance sheet and ongoing earnings we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered deposits to of total assets which gave availability of at December and at December Brokered and national certificates were and of assets at December and December respectively Due to a limited number of providers of repurchase agreement funding as well as our desire to retain unencumbered securities for liquidity purposes and adverse impacts from holding additional FHLB capital stock brokered certificate of deposit funding is expected to increase to the extent future loan growth is not funded with local deposit growth Participants in the brokered certificate market must be considered well capitalized under current regulatory capital standards to acquire brokered deposits without approval of their primary federal regulator We regularly acquire brokered deposits from three market providers and maintain relationships with other providers to obtain required funds at the lowest possible cost Ten business days are typically required between the request for brokered funding and settlement Therefore brokered deposits are a reliable but not daily source of liquidity Brokered deposits represent our largest source of wholesale funding and we would see significant negative impacts if capital levels or earnings were to decline to levels not considered to be well capitalized In addition to the requirement to be considered well capitalized banks under regulatory consent orders are not permitted to participate in the brokered deposit market without approval of their primary federal regulator even if they maintain a well capitalized capital classification Holding company unsecured line of credit We maintained a line of credit with a Bankers Bank Madison Wisconsin as a contingency liquidity source at December At December we maintained a line of credit with U S Bank No amounts were drawn on either line at December or Although our bank subsidiary has in the past provided the holding company s liquidity needs through semi annual upstream dividends of profits losses or other negative performance trends could prevent the bank from providing these dividends as cash flow Because our bank holding company has approximately of financing payments per year as well as approximately of other expenses before tax benefits the holding company line of credit is a critical source of potential liquidity We were subject to financial covenants associated with the line as of December which required our bank subsidiary to Maintain Tier leverage Tier risk based capital and Tier risk based capital ratios above and respectively Maintain nonperforming assets excluding accruing troubled debt restructured loans as a percentage of tangible equity plus the allowance for loan losses to less than At December we were not in violation of any of the line of credit covenants A violation of any covenant could prevent us from utilizing the unused balance of the line of credit The line of credit expires during December but is expected to be renewed upon maturity If liquidity needs persist after exhausting all available funds from the sources described above we would consider more drastic methods to raise funds including but not limited to sale of investment securities at a loss cessation of lending to new or existing customers sale of branch real estate in a sale leaseback transaction surrender of bank owned life insurance to obtain the cash surrender value net of taxes due packaging and sale of residential mortgage loan pools held in our portfolio sale of foreclosed assets at a loss and sale of mortgage servicing rights Such actions could generate undesirable sale losses or income tax impacts While sale of additional common stock or issuance of other types of capital could provide additional liquidity the ability to find significant buyers of such capital issues during a liquidity crisis would be difficult making such a source of funding unlikely or unreliable if the liquidity crisis was caused by our deteriorating financial condition Table of Contents compared to Overnight federal funds purchased Our aggregate federal funds purchase availability was at December compared to at December To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line we need to maintain a composite ratio as defined by Bankers Bank of or less At December our subsidiary bank s composite ratio was approximately and less than the benchmark used by Bankers Bank During and the only federal funds line used was our line from Bankers Bank as part of our regular daily cash management system Federal Reserve discount window advances During we were granted permission by the Federal Reserve to participate in their Borrower in Custody BIC program that allows us to pledge performing commercial and commercial real estate loans against overnight Discount Window advances During the annualized interest rate due on Discount Window advances was although this rate was increased to by the Federal Reserve on February We could draw up to million on our Discount Window line of credit but were limited to a maximum advance of and at December and respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged At December we could borrow on the Discount Window approximately to of the principal amount of loans pledged under the BIC program No Discount Window advances were used during or Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances During the FHLB made available the pledging of certain municipal investment securities against advances which could increase our maximum advance liquidity with the FHLB although this increase is not reflected in Table due to specific limitations on the municipal securities eligible to be pledged Although up to an additional of FHLB advances could be obtained on existing mortgage collateral due to our desire to maintain our current investment in FHLB capital stock of the amount of unused but available FHLB advances at December before additional capital stock would be required is Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Securities not pledged to the Federal Reserve for the Discount Window or pledged to the FHLB for advances are available for pledging against repurchase agreements During borrower costs related to repurchase agreements increased compared to other wholesale funding alternatives and the number of correspondent banks providing such financing declined No wholesale repurchase agreements were used during As an alternative to pledging securities against repurchase agreements such securities could also be pledged against FHLB advances as noted previously subject to the purchase of additional FHLB capital stock for aggregate advances in excess of Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position balance sheet and ongoing earnings we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered certificates to of total assets which gave availability of at December and at December Brokered certificates were of assets at December and of assets at December Holding company unsecured line of credit Our parent company PSB Holdings Inc maintained a line of credit with U S Bank as contingency liquidity at the holding company level at December and The line of credit remained unused during and Liquidity Measurements and Contingency Plan Our liquidity management and contingency plan calls for quarterly measurement of key funding capital problem loan and liquidity contingency ratios at our banking subsidiary level The measurements are compared to various risk levels that direct management to further responses to declining liquidity measurements as outlined below Risk Level is defined as circumstances that create the potential for elevated liquidity risk thus requiring an assessment of possible funding deficiencies Normal business operations plans and strategies are not anticipated to be immediately impacted Risk Level is defined as circumstances that point to an increased potential for disruptions in the Bank s funding plans needs and or resources Assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis is more urgent and identification and prioritization of pre emptive alternatives and actions may be both warranted and time sensitive Table of Contents Risk Level is defined as circumstances that create a likely funding problem or are symptomatic of circumstances that are highly correlated with impending funding problems and therefore are expected to require some level of immediate action depending upon the situation These risk parameters and other qualitative and environmental factors are considered to determine whether a Stress Level response is required Identification of a risk trigger does not automatically call for a stress level response The following summarizes our response plans to various degrees of liquidity stress Stress Level A Management provides a written summary evaluating the warning indicators and why it is deemed unlikely that there will be a resulting liquidity challenge Stress Level B Management provides an assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis and completes a sources and uses of funds report to estimate the impact on pro forma liquidity Liquidity stress tests will be reviewed to ensure the scenarios being simulated are sufficiently robust and that there is adequate funding to satisfy potential demands for cash Various pre emptive actions will be considered and acted on as needed Stress Level C Management has determined a funding crisis is likely and documents detailed assessments of the current liquidity situation and future liquidity needs The Board approved action plan is carried out with vigor and may call for one or all of the following steps among others to mitigate the liquidity concern sale of loans intensify local deposit gathering programs transferring unencumbered securities and loans to the Federal Reserve for Discount Window borrowings curtail all lending except for specifically approved loans reduce or suspend stock dividends and investigate opportunities to raise new capital During we increased our Risk Level trigger points related to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans relative to capital The Risk Level trigger for commercial and industrial loans was increased from of capital at December to of capital as of December Likewise the Risk Level trigger for commercial real estate loans was increased from at December to at December These increases were considered appropriate due to our concentration on commercial related lending to local borrowers and relatively low levels of capital and therefore we consistently exceeded these triggers at the prior year levels However we have historically experienced net loan charge offs on commercial related lending less than similar sized banks and do not consider this mix of loans to signify an undercapitalized position No Risk Level triggers were exceeded at December and no liquidity stress levels were considered to exist At December commercial and industrial loans were of capital and commercial real estate loans were of capital exceeding their Risk Level trigger points of and respectively However no liquidity stress level was considered to exist at December As part of our formal quarterly asset liability management projections we also measure basic surplus as the amount of existing net liquid assets after deducting short term liabilities and coverage for anticipated deposit funding outflows during the next days divided by total assets The basic surplus calculation does not consider unused but available correspondent bank federal funds purchased as those funds are subject to availability based on the correspondent bank s own liquidity needs and therefore are not guaranteed contractual funds However basic surplus does include unused but available FHLB advances under the open line of credit supported by a blanket lien on mortgage collateral Basic surplus does not include available brokered certificate of deposit funding as those funds generally may not be obtained within one business day following the request for funding Our policy is to maintain a basic surplus of at least Basic surplus was and at December and December respectively CAPITAL RESOURCES We are required to maintain minimum levels of capital to be considered well capitalized under current banking regulation Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these requirements and our current capital position relative to these requirements The Dodd Frank Act calls for higher regulatory minimums to be considered well capitalized Although we expect the new capital guidelines to be published in no written guidance has yet been provided on how much the minimum levels will be raised In addition regulatory limitations on fee income and higher compliance burdens are expected to spur a wave of bank consolidation and merger and acquisition activity in the coming years Acquisition of another bank or bank location for growth would likely pressure our regulatory capital ratios lower and increase the potential for a new common or preferred stock capital issue which could dilute existing stockholders The primary increase in stockholders equity during the three years ended December has been retained net income not distributed to stockholders via cash dividends or share buybacks on the open market Failure to remain well capitalized would prevent us from obtaining future wholesale broker time deposits which have been an important source of funding during the past several years Refer to Item Statement of Changes in Stockholder s Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed activity in the capital accounts Average tangible common capital to total

this Annual Report on Form K Prior to we maintained an informal annual ongoing share repurchase program of up to of outstanding shares per year as described in Item of this Annual Report on Form K Due to the difficulty and related cost of raising new capital to support asset growth at this time we temporarily suspended the buyback program beginning during and no shares were repurchased during the three years ended December While we do not expect to buyback a significant number of shares as treasury stock during share repurchases on the open market are one strategy we could consider to build shareholder value if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year During we issued of senior subordinated notes to provide regulatory capital to support commercial loan growth during and Refer to Item Note in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the issue Beginning July we have the ability to repay the Notes in part or in full Repayment of the Notes to reduce interest expense is a strategy that could be considered during if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year We have issued trust preferred securities represented by junior subordinated debentures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which may provide up to of our total Tier regulatory capital Refer to Item Note in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the trust preferred security issue The Dodd Frank Act no longer permits us to issue new trust preferred securities as Tier capital as in prior years although our existing million trust preferred capital securities are grandfathered as Tier capital Senior Subordinated Notes and Junior Subordinated Debentures represent approximately of our total regulatory capital Unlike our common stock these capital obligations require regular quarterly interest payments that may not be eliminated if our financial condition were to deteriorate although the interest payments on junior subordinated notes could be deferred for up to five years before considered a default of the debt Therefore we expect any future capital needs during the next several years beyond retained earnings from operations to be met via issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock although no current plans for issuance of common or preferred stock exist Table of Contents In December the U S Treasury introduced a new small bank capital program known as the Small Business Lending Fund established by the Small Business Jobs Act with funding up to billion in an effort to spur small business lending Under the program only available to well performing banks less than billion in assets such as us banks may issue Preferred Stock to the U S Treasury with a variable dividend rate that could later be fixed as low as depending on the level of small business lending growth during the first quarters following issuance of the preferred stock The preferred stock dividend later resets to on the year anniversary of the preferred stock issue until repaid We decided not to participate in the Small Business Lending Fund due to concerns over the extent of organic loan growth available and strict limitations on using the capital to support assets obtained in purchase of another bank as well has our historically high level of existing regulatory capital We are considered well capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of at December compared to at December Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of to be considered well capitalized During total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to risk weighting rather than the risk weighting assigned in prior years In addition we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio These changes along with retained net income increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than We maintain an incentive stock option plan approved by stockholders during and a restricted stock plan as described in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The total expense recognized under both plans was and during and respectively As a measurement of the adequacy of a bank s capital base related to its level of nonperforming assets many investors use a non GAAP measure commonly referred to as the Texas Ratio We also track changes in our Texas Ratio against our internal capital and liquidity risk parameters to highlight negative capital trends that could impact our ability for future growth payment of dividends to shareholders or other factors As noted previously correspondent bank providers of our daily federal funds purchased line of credit and the holding company operating line of credit use similar measures that impact our ability to continued use of those lines of credit if our level of nonperforming assets to capital were to rise above prescribed levels The following table presents the

originated by our lenders and sold to the FHLB and FNMA As a FHLB Mortgage Partnership Finance MPF loan servicer we provide a credit enhancement guarantee to reimburse the FHLB for foreclosure losses in excess of of the original loan principal sold to the FHLB prior to November Refer to Item Notes and of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the FHLB MPF program These first mortgage loans are underwritten using standardized criteria we consider to be conservative on residential properties in our local communities We believe loans serviced for the FHLB will realize minimal foreclosure losses in the future and that we will experience no loan losses related to charge offs in excess of the FHLB First Loss Account The north central Wisconsin residential real estate market is experiencing similar home value declines as the state of Wisconsin as a whole which are moderate when compared to other states in the country The average residential first mortgage originated by us under the FHLB program which required a credit enhancement was approximately in and during the last two years of the program Under bank regulatory capital rules this FHLB recourse obligation to the FHLB is risk weighted for the purposes of the total capital to risk weighted assets capital calculation Total risk based capital required to be held for the recourse obligations under the FHLB MPF programs for capital adequacy purposes was at December and and at December During October we ceased origination and sale of loans to the FHLB that required a credit enhancement and no additional risk based capital will be required to support such loans More information on all loans serviced for other investors including FHLB and FNMA is outlined in Table Other significant off balance sheet financial instruments include the various loan commitments outlined in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon During we sold a new product that allowed certain adjustable rate commercial loan customers to fix their interest rate with an interest rate swap Refer to Item Note of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the program At December there were in interest rate swaps outstanding under the program Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing We service and of residential real estate loans which have been sold to the FHLB and FNMA at December and respectively Loans sold to FHLB and FNMA are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets An annualized servicing fee equal to of outstanding principal is retained from payments collected from the customer as compensation for servicing the loan for the FHLB and FNMA For loans originated and sold to the FHLB prior to November we are also paid an annualized credit enhancement fee of to of outstanding serviced principal in addition to the collected for servicing the loan for the FHLB impacting or of loans serviced for the FHLB at December compared to or at December See also Off Balance Sheet Arrangements in Item Note and Loans in Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Mortgage loan servicing and credit enhancement fees have been an important source of mortgage banking income Because no further loans are sold to the FHLB with our credit enhancement we expect credit enhancement fees to decline in future years as this serviced principal is repaid Credit enhancements fees were in in and in Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of mortgage banking revenue We recognize a mortgage servicing right asset due to the substantial volume of loans serviced for the FHLB and FNMA Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our mortgage servicing right accounting policies Losses incurred by the FHLB on loans in the MPF program and the MPF program are absorbed by the FHLB in their First Loss Account If cumulative losses were to exceed the First Loss Account we would reimburse the FHLB for any excess losses up to the extent of our Credit Enhancement Guarantee Ten years after the original pool master commitment date the First Loss Account and the Credit Enhancement Guarantee are reset to current levels based on loans remaining in the pool These factors are further reset every subsequent five years until the pool is repaid During the MPF program reached its ten year anniversary and the First Loss Account and Credit Enhancement Guarantee associated with that program were reset to the new level shown in Table The next First Loss Account reset date for any individual master commitment containing our Credit Enhancement Guarantee is scheduled for August Due to historical strength of mortgage borrowers in our markets and relative stability of collateral home values and the original of principal First Loss Account provided by the FHLB we believe the possibility of losses under guarantees to the FHLB to be remote Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in only million of million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account Accordingly no provision for a recourse liability has been made for this recourse obligation on loans currently serviced by us Loans originated and sold to the FHLB under their XTRA program do not require credit enhancement and PSB has no risk of principal loss on such loans properly underwritten and sold Table of Contents All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations During we were required to repurchase a foreclosed loan and incur a loss related to underwriting violations related to private mortgage guarantee insurance We have reviewed our existing portfolio and believe we do not have continued risk for significant loss on other loans that could have this underwriting issue Other than this loan we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since and have never been required to repurchase a loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expect to be required to repurchase loans in the near term Table summarizes the various programs and investors for which we serviced loans as of December and Table Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing for Others At December

		<c><![CDATA[ Business Outlook Management expects revenues in fiscal to increase over fiscal year Expectations are for product mix and margins to remain favorable for fiscal year During fiscal new orders received by the Company were approximately million The order backlog of approximately million at June gives the Company a solid base of future sales It is presently anticipated that a minimum of million of orders comprising the June backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June The minimum of million does not include any shipments which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June See discussions below for further detail on the customer mix included in the backlog In addition to the backlog the Company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies transformers and subassemblies However there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally Two significant customers represented and of the Company s total sales in fiscal and respectively These sales are in connection with multiyear programs in which the Company is a significant subcontractor The June backlog of million includes orders from two customers that represent and of the total backlog A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company Historically a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company s total sales in any given fiscal year For several years management has pursued opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program and minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer Management continues to evaluate its business development functions and potential revised courses of action in order to diversify its customer base The Company currently has a very high concentration level with two customers and this presents significant risk Management along with the Board of Directors continues to evaluate the need and use of the Company s working capital Capital expenditures are expected to be app roximately for fiscal Expectations are that the working capital will be required to fund orders dividend payments and general operations of the business From time to time management along with the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee of the Board of Directors examine opportunities involving acquisitions or other strategic options including buying certain products or product lines The criteria for consideration are synergies with the Company s existing product base and accretion to earnings Net Sales for fiscal years ended June and were and respectively an increase This increase can be attributed to the contract specific nature of the Company s business and the timing of deliveries on these contracts More specifically shipments of power supplies increased by approximately million while transformers increased by approximately million For the fiscal years ended June and gross profits were and respectively Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent at and for fiscal and respectively The primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher as compared to products that are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts has a significant impact on gross profit and net income The increased gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales volume Employment of full time equivalents at June and June was people Selling general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended June a decrease of or as compared to the prior year The decrease for fiscal relates primarily to a decrease in salary expense as well as relocation and transportation cost decreases Other income for the fiscal years ended June and was and respectively The increase is attributable higher sales of left over scrap metal The effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its qualified production activities under The American Jobs Creation Act of and the benefit derived from the dividends paid on allocated ESOP shares Net income for fiscal was or and per share basic and diluted respectively compared to net income of or and per share basic and diluted respectively for fiscal The increase in net income per share was primarily due to higher sales higher gross profit on sales and lower selling general and administrative expenses Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business and during the past two fiscal years the Company when possible has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years The Company s working capital as of June and was and respectively During the three months ended June and the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock During the fiscal year ended June and the Company repurchased and shares respectively of its common stock for a total purchase price of and respectively All shares were purchased from the Company s ESOP Under existing authorizations from the Company s Board of Directors as of June management is authorized to purchase an additional million of Company stock The table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal year indicated Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in provided by investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in net income the timing of the collection of accounts receivable purchase of inventory level of sales and payments of accounts payable Net cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and a decrease in proceeds from maturity of investment securities The decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long term funding requirements for the foreseeable future Management believes that the Company s reserve for bad debts of is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business Historically bad debt expense has been minimal During fiscal year and fiscal the Company expended and respectively for plant improvements and new equipment The Company has budgeted approximately for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements We believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts Revenue Recognition and Estimates A significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts Generally revenues on long term fixed price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules Contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of overhead costs The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above it is possible that materially different amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used based on changes in circumstances in the estimation process When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined changes are reflected in current period earnings ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[ The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which appear in Item of this Report Revenues for fiscal increased by over fiscal however net earnings decreased by The decrease in earnings for the year is attributed to increased expenses needed to reorganize the Company s license operations in Mexico and full year expenses for an expanded sales staff The Company believes that these investments in staff will strengthen the Company and provide greater returns during fiscal Gross profit margins decreased slightly mostly due to product mix Foreign sales increased by Markets have begun to stabilize and new orders are trending higher As a result the Company expects to begin fiscal with an increased backlog Inventories at June were higher than at year end fiscal which were needed to support the higher incoming sales rate Cash decreased by to mostly due to the per share special dividend an aggregate of paid in December Prospects for fiscal appear favorable as the economy continues to improve and credit is becoming more available In August the Company received a number of large contracts on which the Company had submitted favorable bids These contracts which are scheduled to be shipped in fiscal have substantially increased the Company s subsequent backlog With a strong financial position and an experienced and reorganized sales staff the Company is hopeful it will improve its performance in fiscal Liquidity and Capital Resources For the twelve month period ended June cash decreased by compared to an increase of during fiscal The following table summarizes the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Years Ended June Net cash provided used by Operating activities Investing activities Financing activities For the twelve month period ended June operating activities provided cash of compared to of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily provided by the Company s net earnings of and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of bad debt expenses of and a benefit of in deferred income taxes Additional cash was provided by a decrease in leases and mortgages receivables of and deferred income of These increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts and trade notes receivables of as shipments were heavy during the last month of fiscal and payments were not yet due Cash of was used to increase inventories to support new orders In addition a decrease of in accounts payable and accrued expenses represents early payments to vendors so that discounts could be realized Cash was also used to decrease accrued employee expenses by Income taxes payable and refundable income taxes used cash of Customer deposits decreased by due to shipments made in the third quarter from the Company s backlog while newer orders did not require deposits due to their smaller size Other assets used cash of in the normal course of business Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily provided by the Company s net earnings of and by an increase of in customer deposits The increase in customer deposits resulted from increased orders which trended higher than sales during the period Cash was also provided by non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of bad debts of and a benefit of in deferred income taxes Other changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash were increases in income taxes payable of and accrued employee expenses of and decreases in leases and mortgages receivable of and other current assets of The primary use of cash in fiscal was an increase in inventories of partially offset by a increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing unpaid invoices not yet due to support the increase in inventories Other uses of cash consisted of a increase in accounts and trade notes receivable and a reduction of in inventory reserves This reserve was placed against returned inventory in prior years which the Company resold during the first quarter of fiscal Investing activities used cash of and for the years ended June and respectively mostly for capital expenditures Financing activities used cash of in fiscal to pay dividends There were no expenditures in financing activities during fiscal The Company s original revolving line of credit facility expired on October Due to a change in ownership at the Company s former lender as a result of the acquisition of the former lender by a new lender a new line of credit facility was entered into on November The new credit facility provides a revolving line of credit that entitles the Company to borrow from time to time up to including a standby letter of credit sub facility for the purchase of inventory and a foreign exchange contract sub facility The Company s obligations under the new facility are guaranteed by the Company s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets No amounts were outstanding under either facility at June and nor were there any amounts outstanding at any time during fiscal or The new facility requires maintenance of certain debt service coverage and leverage ratios and contained other restrictive covenants including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness pay dividends guarantee indebtedness of others grant liens sell assets and make investments The Company was in compliance with these covenants at June and The Company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents net cash from operations and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and to meet its long term liquidity needs Off Balance Sheet Financing The Company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements within the meaning of Item a of Regulation S K Year Ended June Net sales Development fees franchise and license fees commissions and other Total revenues Net sales for the year ended June increased by over fiscal For the twelve month period ended June equipment and parts sales increased by and respectively over fiscal attributable to a reorganized sales staff which enabled the Company to have greater penetration of its territory Although the economy is still unstable new orders have been trending higher increasing the Company s backlog at year end compared to During the year foreign sales also increased by Table of Contents Revenues of development fees franchising and license fees commission and other income increased by in fiscal when compared to fiscal The improvement can be attributed to the reorganization of our Mexican licensing operations and an increase in equipment restocking charges which offset a substantial commission received in fiscal on a sale by another distributor for an installation in the Company s territory Year Ended June As a percentage of net sales Cost of sales net As a percentage of revenues Selling general and administrative expenses Total expenses Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal The percentage varies slightly from year to year due to the mix of products sold Selling general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal from fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenues to from The increase was mostly attributable to the increase in payroll expenses as a result of the reorganization and expansion of the sales staff Also contributing to the increase were stockholder expenses as the Company now must adhere to XBRL reporting requirements and professional fees Offsetting these increases in administrative expenses were decreases in office expenses service engineering and travel and entertainment expenses Interest income decreased by in fiscal from fiscal mostly due to lower prevailing interest rates The Company s effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal The slight variation in percentage reflects changes in both permanent and temporary adjustments to taxable income Inflation Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company s operations during any of the reported periods Transactions with Related Parties The Company leases square feet of warehouse and office space from the Sheila Steiner Revocable Trust The trustees of this trust are Sheila Steiner her husband William K Steiner and her son Michael S Steiner William K Steiner is Chairman of the Board of Directors and a director of the Company and Michael S Steiner is President and a director of the Company Michael Steiner individually is also a principal shareholder of the Company Annual rental expense under this lease was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal The lease was for an original three year term which commenced on November with two three year renewal options in favor of the Company The Company has exercised the second renewal option extending the lease until October The lease provides for annual rent increases commencing November of over the rent in the prior year The Company bears the cost of real estate taxes utilities maintenance non structural repairs and insurance The Company believes that the terms of the lease are comparable to terms that would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party for similar property in a similar locale In fiscal and the Company paid a law firm in which a director is Senior Counsel approximately and respectively for legal services performed Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Securities and Exchange Commission Financial Reporting Release No encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities On an ongoing basis management evaluates these estimates including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable leases and mortgages the carrying value of inventories and long lived assets the timing of revenue recognition for initial license and franchise fees from sales of franchise arrangements and continuing license and franchise service fees as well as sales returns Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recognition of revenues and expenses and the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Revenue Recognition and Accounts and Trade Notes Receivable Products are generally shipped Freight on Board FOB from the Company s warehouse or drop shipped from the Company s Vendor FOB at which time risk of loss and title passes to the purchaser Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of the arrangement delivery has occurred the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured In some cases the Company collects non income related taxes including sales and use tax from its customers and remits those taxes to governmental authorities The Company presents revenues net of these taxes Shipping delivery and handling fee income is included in revenues in the consolidated financial statements Shipping delivery and handling costs are included in cost of sales Commissions and development fees are recorded when earned generally when the services are performed or the transaction is closed Individual franchise arrangements include a license and provide for payment of initial fees as well as continuing royalties Initial franchise fees are generally recorded upon the opening of the franchised store which is evidenced by a certificate from the franchisee indicating that the store has opened and collectability is reasonably assured Continuing royalties represent regular contractual payments received for the use of the DRYCLEAN USA marks which are recognized as revenue when earned generally on a straight line basis Accounts and trade notes receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms The Company sells its products primarily to independent and franchise dry clean stores and chains laundry plants hotels motels cruise lines hospitals nursing homes government institutions and distributors The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and depending on the term of credit the amount of the credit granted and management s past history with a customer the Company may require the customer to grant a security interest in the purchased equipment as collateral for the receivable Senior management reviews accounts and trade notes receivable on a regular basis to determine if any such amounts will potentially be uncollectible The Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible along with a general reserve based on older aged amounts in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed the receivable is written off Based on the information available to management it believes the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of June and is adequate However actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance Table of Contents Franchise License Trademark and Other Intangible Assets Franchise licenses trademarks patents and trade names are stated at cost less accumulated amortization Those assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited years Patents are amortized over the shorter of the patents useful life or legal life from the date such patents are granted The Company reviews the recoverability of intangible assets based primarily upon an analysis of undiscounted cash flows from the intangible assets In the event the expected future net cash flows should become less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss will be recorded in the period the determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets Income Taxes The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic Income Taxes ASC Under the asset and liability method of ASC deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled Under ASC the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date If it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is recognized Significant judgment is required in developing the Company s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets Management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely that the asset will not be realized The Company follows ASC Topic Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes The Company does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax benefits related to certain tax positions taken on its various income tax returns The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U S federal and state authorities for the years through Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In January the FASB issued ASU Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC

Partnership Owned Units We manage and control the operations of the eight restaurants owned by limited partnerships except the Fort Lauderdale Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner This new restaurant opened for business on December Accordingly the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants except the Fort Lauderdale Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method REVENUES in thousands Fifty Two Fifty Two Weeks Ended Weeks Ended Sept

to for our fiscal year an increase of or The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales which includes all nine Company owned package liquor stores was for our fiscal year as compared to for our fiscal year Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses consisting of cost of merchandise sold payroll and related costs occupancy costs and selling general and administrative expenses for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year The increase was primarily due to the costs related to our new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December the shopping center in Miami Florida acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year and to an expected general increase in food costs including an increase in the cost of poultry offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance to our units and actions taken by management to reduce and or control costs and expenses We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year for the same reasons Operating costs and expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales to approximately in our fiscal year from in our fiscal year Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales Restaurant Food and Bar Sales Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year increased to from for our fiscal year Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales was for our fiscal year and for our fiscal year We anticipate that our gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease during our fiscal year due to higher food costs including our cost of poultry offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year Package Liquor Store Sales Gross profit for package liquor store sales for our fiscal year decreased to from for our fiscal year Our gross profit margin calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales for package liquor store sales was for our fiscal year and for our fiscal year The decrease in our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales during our fiscal year was due to our inability to purchase close out and inventory reduction merchandise from wholesalers which we were able to obtain during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year We anticipate that our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year Payroll and Related Costs Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year due primarily to an increase in the Florida minimum wage which was effective January and to increases in payroll taxes including unemployment taxes We anticipate that our payroll and related costs will increase throughout our fiscal year due primarily to payroll associated with the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total sales was in our fiscal year and of total sales in our fiscal year Occupancy Costs Occupancy costs consisting of rent common area maintenance repairs real property taxes and amortization of leasehold interests for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year Our occupancy costs increased primarily due to increasing percentage rents at various locations and due to rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership which commenced January partially offset by the elimination of rent from a limited partnership owned restaurant located in the shopping center in Miami Florida which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year and the elimination of rent paid for our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at Biscayne Boulevard North Miami Florida the real property and building of which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year We anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year as rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami Florida will be offset by the reduction in rental payments as a result of our purchase of the building on November where Store is located Table of Contents Selling General and Administrative Expenses Selling general and administrative expenses consisting of general corporate expenses including but not limited to advertising insurance professional costs clerical and administrative overhead for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year Selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales in our fiscal year to as compared to in our fiscal year We anticipate that our selling general and administrative expenses will increase throughout our fiscal year due primarily to the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December the shopping center acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year and increases across all categories Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for our fiscal year decreased or to from for our fiscal year As a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was of revenue for our fiscal year and of revenue for our fiscal year Interest Expense Net Interest expense for our fiscal year increased to from for our fiscal year I nterest expense increased during our fiscal year primarily due to the interest paid on the million mortgage loan the proceeds of which we used to purchase a shopping center in Miami Florida and a million term loan the proceeds of which were also ultimately used to purchase the shopping center while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves Net Income Attributable to Stockholders Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year decreased or to from for our fiscal year As a percentage of sales net income for our fiscal year is as compared to in our fiscal year During our fiscal year we recognized income of offset by income tax of from the sale of our interest as guarantor of a nine year leasehold interest Without giving effect to the above non recurring item our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year would have increased or to for our fiscal year Table of Contents New Limited Partnership Restaurants As new restaurants open our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations During our fiscal year we recognized pre opening rent expense in the approximate amount of for the Miami Florida restaurant which opened for business on December During our fiscal year we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening rent We are recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease During our fiscal year the limited partnership restaurant in Miami Florida which opened for business on December reported losses of primarily due to pre opening costs thus contributing to a reduction in the operating income for our fiscal year During our fiscal year we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening costs We believe that our current cash on hand together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months Trends During the next twelve months we expect that our restaurant food and bar sales will increase but gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease due to higher food costs including our cost of poultry offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year We anticipate that our package liquor store sales and gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year We expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income W e also plan to continue our increased advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition With our recent menu price increases we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses which will adversely affect our net income We may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible We currently have a new restaurant in the development stage which opened for business on December using our limited partnership ownership model We continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business Any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model We are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available we will consider it Liquidity and Capital Resources We fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations As of September we had cash of approximately an increase of from our cash balance of as of October The increase in cash as of September was primarily due to a balance of of net proceeds from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami Florida restaurant and opened for business on December Management believes that the Company s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months Table of Contents Cash Flows Fiscal Years in thousands Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities Net increase decrease in cash and equivalents Cash and equivalents beginning of year Cash and equivalents end of year Capital Expenditures In addition to using cash for our operating expenses we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants We acquired property and equipment of including of which was financed and of deposits recorded in other assets as of October during our fiscal year including for renovations to one existing Company owned restaurant and three existing limited partnership owned restaurants During our fiscal year we acquired property and equipment of including of which was financed and of deposits recorded in other assets as of October during our fiscal year including for renovations to one existing Company owned restaurant All of our owned units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive The cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year was for renovations to one existing Company owned restaurant and for renovations to three limited partnership owned restaurants We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year will be approximately which funds will be provided from operations Table of Contents Debt As of the end of our fiscal year we had debt of as compared to as of the end of our fiscal year As of September we are in compliance with the covenants of all loans with our lender We repaid long term debt including auto loans financed insurance premiums and mortgages in

September the aggregate principal balance owed from the financing of our property and general liability insurance policies is Purchase Commitments In order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants on September we entered into a purchase agreement with a new rib supplier whereby we agreed to purchase approximately of baby back ribs during calendar year from this vendor at a fixed cost While we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor we believe there are several other alternative vendors available if needed Purchase of Limited Partnership Interests During our fiscal year we purchased from one limited partner who is not an officer director or family member of officers or directors a limited partnership interest of in one limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of During our fiscal year we purchased from one limited partner who is not an officer director or family member of officers or directors a limited partnership interest of in one limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of Working capital The table below summarizes our current assets current liabilities and working capital for our fiscal years and Table of Contents Sept Oct in thousands Current assets Current liabilities Working capital Our working capital as of September increased by from working capital as of October Our working capital increased during our fiscal year from our working capital for our fiscal year ended October primarily due to the net funds remaining from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami Florida restaurant While there can be no assurance due to among other things unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues or both we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year including payment for a new point of sale system for our restaurants Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note to our consolidated financial statements located in Item of this Annual Report on Form K The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment The estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material In addition periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering among other things expected use life of the lease on the building and warranty period if applicable The assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary Table of Contents Consolidation of Limited Partnerships As of September we operate eight restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner This new restaurant opened for business on December Additionally we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening additional new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding As a result of these controlling interests we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation The noncontrolling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share Income Taxes FASB ASC Topic Income Taxes requires among other things recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year Other Matters Impact of Inflation The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food beverage and labor costs A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs To date inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise Table of Contents As part of our ongoing operations we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings As more fully described in Note Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form K we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations At September we had four variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates In July we converted the amount outstanding on our line of credit to a term loan the Term Loan and we also re financed the mortgage loan encumbering our corporate offices the Refinanced Mortgage Loan In November we financed our purchase of the real property and two building shopping center in Miami Florida with a mortgage loan the M Mortgage Loan and received a term loan the M Term Loan the proceeds of which were ultimately used to purchase the shopping center while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves As a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments we entered into interest rate swap agreements with our unrelated third party lender to convert these variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates We are currently party to the following four interest rate swap agreements i One interest rate swap agreement entered into in July relates to the Term Loan the Term Loan Swap which converts the LIBOR based variable rate interest to a fixed rate The Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a three year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at the British Bankers Association LIBOR LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount Under this method of accounting at September we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender t he fair value of the Term Loan Swap was not significant and ii The second interest rate swap agreement entered into July relates to the Refinanced Mortgage Loan the Mortgage Loan Swap The Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount Under this method of accounting at September we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender t he fair value of the Mortgage Loan Swap was not significant and iii The third interest rate swap agreement entered into in November by our wholly owned subsidiary Flanigan s Calusa Center LLC relates to the Mortgage Loan the M Mortgage Loan Swap The M Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for an eight year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Month plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount We determined that at September the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material and Table of Contents iv The fourth interest rate swap agreement entered into in November relates to the M Term Loan the M Term Loan Swap The M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Month plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount We determined that at September the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material At September our cash resources earn interest at variable rates Accordingly our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates There is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations ]]></c>

Military Academy in West Point New York h e has also served as an Officer in the United States Army where he received a Bronze Star for his bravery during Operation Desert Storm Item A Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below and under Part II Risks Related to Our Industry The convenience store and retail fuel industries are highly competitive and impacted by new entrants Increased competition could result in lower margins The convenience store and retail fuel industries in the geographic areas in which we operate are highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering the products and services found in our stores We compete with numerous other convenience store chains independent convenience stores supermarkets drugstores discount clubs fuel service stations mass merchants fast food operations and other similar retail outlets In recent years several non traditional retailers including supermarkets club stores and mass merchants have begun to compete directly with convenience stores These non traditional fuel retailers have obtained a significant share of the fuel market and their market share is expected to grow and these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts both at the fuel pump and in the store to encourage in store merchandise sales and fuel sales Increased value consciousness among consumers has accelerated sales declines as consumers turn to dollar stores and big box stores to fulfill needs that were traditionally fulfilled by convenience stores Additionally major convenience store operators have announced intentions to enter or expand in markets we currently serve In some of our markets our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial marketing and other resources than we do As a result our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry To remain competitive we must constantly analyze consumer preferences and competitors offerings and prices to ensure we offer a selection of convenience products and services at competitive prices to meet consumer demand We must also maintain and upgrade our customer service levels facilities and locations to remain competitive and drive customer traffic to our stores Principal competitive factors include among others location ease of access fuel brands pricing product and service selections customer service store appearance cleanliness and safety From time to time our competitors may sell fuel or alternative energy products which are not available to us due to our fuel contracts Competitive pressures could materially impact our fuel and merchandise volume sales and gross profit and overall customer traffic which could in turn have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Volatility in oil and wholesale fuel costs could impact our operating results Oil and domestic wholesale fuel markets are volatile General political conditions acts of war or terrorism instability in oil producing regions particularly in the Middle East and South America and the value of the U S dollar could significantly impact oil supplies and wholesale fuel costs In addition the supply of fuel and our wholesale purchase costs could be materially impacted in the event of a shortage which could result from among other things lack of capacity at United States oil refineries sustained increase in global demand or the fact that our fuel contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted unlimited supply of fuel Significant increases and volatility in wholesale fuel costs have resulted and could in the future result in significant increases in the retail price of fuel products and in lower fuel gross margin per gallon This volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition Dramatic increases in oil prices squeeze retail fuel margin because fuel costs typically increase faster than retailers are able to pass them along to customers A significant change in any of these factors could materially impact our fuel and merchandise volume fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic which in turn could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations In addition rising fuel costs have other adverse impacts which include i liquidity as it increases the cost of our fuel inventory as well as the size of related letters of credit we must obtain and ii fuel costs are a focus of national attention and rising fuel costs in the past have lead to political criticisms of fuel sellers as well as investigations into alleged fuel price gouging Changes in credit card expenses could tighten profit margin especially on fuel A significant portion of our fuel sales involve payment using credit cards We are assessed credit card fees as a percentage of transaction amounts and not as a fixed dollar amount or percentage of our margins Higher fuel prices trigger higher credit card expenses and an increase in credit card use or an increase in credit card fees would have a similar effect Therefore credit card fees charged on fuel purchases that are more expensive as a result of higher fuel prices are not necessarily accompanied by higher profit margins In fact such fees may cause lower profit margins Lower profit margins on fuel sales caused by higher credit card fees may decrease our overall profit margin and could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Changes in economic conditions consumer behavior travel and tourism could impact our business In the convenience store industry customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends growth rates for automobile and commercial truck traffic and trends in travel tourism and weather Changes in economic conditions generally or in the southeastern United States specifically could adversely impact consumer spending patterns and travel and tourism in our markets In particular weakening economic conditions may result in decreases in miles driven and discretionary consumer spending and travel which impact spending on fuel and convenience items In addition changes in the types of products and services demanded by consumers may adversely affect our merchandise sales and gross profit Additionally negative publicity or perception surrounding fuel suppliers could adversely affect their reputation and brand image which may negatively affect our fuel sales and gross profit Similarly advanced technology and increased use of green automobiles i e those automobiles that do not use petroleum based fuel or that run on hybrid fuel sources could drive down demand for fuel Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and preferences while continuing to sell products and services that will positively impact overall merchandise gross profit Many of our stores are located in coastal resort or tourist destinations Historically travel and consumer behavior in such markets is more severely impacted by weak economic conditions such as those currently impacting the United States If the number of visitors to coastal resort or tourist locations decreases due to economic conditions changes in consumer preferences changes in discretionary consumer spending or otherwise our sales could decline which in turn could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Market turmoil and uncertain economic conditions including increases in food and fuel prices changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the financial and credit crisis actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses in consumer retirement and investment accounts and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have resulted in reduced consumer confidence curtailed retail spending and decreases in miles driven There can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence We have experienced periodic per store sales declines in both fuel and merchandise as a result of these economic conditions If these economic conditions persist or deteriorate further we may continue to experience sales declines in both fuel and merchandise which could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Legal technological political and scientific developments regarding climate change may decrease demand for fuel Developments regarding climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and the environment may decrease the demand for our major product petroleum based fuel Attitudes toward our product and its relationship to the environment and the green movement may significantly affect our sales and ability to market our product New technologies developed to steer the public toward non fuel depend e nt means of transportation may create an environment with negative attitudes toward fuel thus affecting the public s attitude toward our major product and potentially having a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Further new technologies developed to improve fuel efficiency or governmental mandates to improve fuel efficiency may result in decreased demand for petroleum based fuel which could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Wholesale cost increases of tax increases on and campaigns to discourage tobacco products could adversely impact our operating results Significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products as well as national and local campaigns to discourage the use of tobacco products may have an adverse effect on demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products Although the states in which we operate have historically imposed relatively low taxes on tobacco products each year one or more of these states consider increasing the tax rate for tobacco products either to raise revenues or deter the use of tobacco Any increase in federal or state taxes on our tobacco products could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes cigarette unit volume and revenues merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic which could in turn have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Currently major cigarette manufacturers offer substantial rebates to retailers We include these rebates as a component of our gross margin from sales of cigarettes In the event these rebates are no longer offered or decreased our wholesale cigarette costs will increase accordingly In general we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers However due to competitive pressures in our markets we may not be able to do so In addition reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by cigarette manufacturers negatively impact gross margins These factors could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes cigarette unit volume and revenues merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic which could in turn have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Federal regulation of tobacco products could adversely impact our operating results In June Congress gave the Food and Drug Administration FDA broad authority to regulate tobacco products through passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act FSPTCA The FSPTCA Sets national performance standards for tobacco products Requires manufacturers with certain exceptions to obtain FDA clearance or approval for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products commercially launched or to be launched Required new and larger warning labels on tobacco products and Requires FDA approval for the use of terms such as light or low tar Under the FSPTCA the F DA has passed regulations that Prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to anyone under the age of years state laws are permitted to set a higher minimum age Prohibit the sale of single cigarettes or packs with less than cigarettes Prohibit the sale or distribution of non tobacco items such as hats and t sh i rts with tobacco brands names or logos Prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in vending machines self service displays or other impersonal modes of sales except in very limited situations Prohibits free samples of cigarettes and limits distribution of smokeless tobacco products Prohibits tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic musical or other social or cultural event or any team or entry in those events Prohibits gifts or other items in exchange for buying cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products and Requires that audio ads use only words with no music or sound effects Governmental actions and regulations such as those noted above as well as statewide smoking bans in restaurants and other public places combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking declines in the number of smokers in the general population and private actions to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced industry volume and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels These governmental actions could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes cigarette unit volume and revenues merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic which could in turn have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Risks Related to Our Business Unfavorable weather conditions the impact of climate change or other trends or developments in the southeastern United States could adversely affect our business Substantially all of our stores are located in the southeastern United States Although the southeast region is generally known for its mild weather the region is susceptible to severe storms including hurricanes thunderstorms tornadoes extended periods of rain ice storms and heavy snow all of which we have historically experienced Inclement weather conditions as well as severe storms in the southeast region could damage our facilities our suppliers or could have a significant impact on consumer behavior travel and convenience store traffic patterns as well as our ability to operate our stores In addition we typically generate higher revenues and gross margins during warmer weather months in the Southeast which fall within our third and fourth fiscal quarters If weather conditions are not favorable during these periods our operating results and cash flow from operations could be adversely affected We could also be impacted by regional occurrences in the southeastern United States such as energy shortages or increases in energy prices fires or other natural disasters Many of our stores are located in coastal resort or tourist destinations Our coastal locations may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters or adverse localized effects of climate change such as sea level rise and increased storm frequency or intensity To the extent broad environmental factors triggered by climate change or otherwise lead to localized physical effects disruption in our business or unexpected relocation costs the performance of stores in these locations could be adversely impacted Besides these more obvious consequences of severe weather to our coastal resort stores our ability to insure these locations and the related cost of such insurance may also impact our business financial condition and results of operations Many insurers already have plans in place to address the increased risks that may arise as a result of climate change with many reducing their near term catastrophic exposure in both reinsurance and primary insurance coverage along the gulf coast and the eastern seaboard Our indebtedness could negatively impact our financial health We are highly leveraged Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences such as Make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and our leases Increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt including lease finance obligations thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes Limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate Place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or better access to capital by for example limiting our ability to enter into new markets or renovate our stores and Limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future We are vulnerable to increases in interest rates because the debt under our senior credit facility is subject to a variable interest rate If we are unable to meet our debt obligations we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations seek additional equity financing or sell assets which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all As a result we could default on those obligations In addition the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes subordinated notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness which would adversely affect our financial health and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations Despite current indebtedness levels we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt This could further increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage We are able to incur additional indebtedness The terms of the indenture that governs our senior notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances The indenture governing our senior subordinated convertible notes convertible notes does not contain any limit on our ability to incur debt In addition the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility permits us to incur additional indebtedness assuming certain financial conditions are met at the time beyond the amounts available under our revolving credit facility If we incur additional indebtedness the related risks that we now face could increase To service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including without limitation any payments required to be made to holders of our subordinated notes and our convertible notes and to refinance our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future This to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control Based on our current level of operations we believe our cash flow from operations available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next months We cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity sell assets reduce or delay capital expenditures seek additional equity financing or seek third party financing to satisfy such obligations We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all Our failure to fund indebtedness obligations at any time could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing such indebtedness which would likely trigger a cross default under our other outstanding debt If we do not comply with the covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our subordinated notes or otherwise default under them or the indenture governing our convertible notes we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due The credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our subordinated notes require us to comply with certain covenants In particular our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness except in specified circumstances or materially amending the terms of any agreement relating to existing indebtedness without lender approval Further our credit agreement restricts our ability to acquire and dispose of assets engage in mergers or reorganizations pay dividends or make investments or capital expenditures Other restrictive covenants require that we meet a maximum total adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement A violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement If we default on the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility the indenture governing our subordinated notes or the indenture governing our convertible notes because of a covenant breach or otherwise all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts and any acceleration of amounts due under our credit agreement or either of the indentures governing our outstanding indebtedness likely would have a material effect on us If future circumstances indicate that goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired there could be a requirement to write down amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and record impairment charges Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we make estimates and assumptions about sales operating margin growth rates consumer spending levels general economic conditions and the market prices for our common stock There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience among others disruptions to the business unexpected significant declines in our operating results divestiture of a significant component of our business changes in operating strategy or sustained market capitalization declines These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future Impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges In addition impairment charges could negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all in the future We are subject to state and federal environmental laws and other regulations Failure to comply with or liabilities pursuant to these laws and regulations may result in penalties or costs that could have a material effect on our business We are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations including but not limited to environmental regulations employment laws and regulations regulations governing the sale of alcohol and tobacco minimum wage requirements working condition requirements public accessibility requirements citizenship requirements and other laws and regulations A violation or change of these laws or regulations could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we may as the owner or operator of our locations be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at these or our former locations whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such contamination The failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral Additionally persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at sites where they are located whether or not such site is owned or operated by such person Although we do not typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be liable for removal or remediation costs as well as other related costs including governmental fines and injuries to persons property and natural resources Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations regulating underground storage tanks may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs The remediation costs and other costs required to clean up or treat contaminated sites could be substantial We pay tank registration fees and other taxes to state trust funds established in our operating areas and maintain private insurance coverage in Florida and Georgia in support of future remediation obligations These state trust funds or other responsible third parties including insurers are expected to pay or reimburse us for remediation expenses less a deductible To the extent third parties do not pay for remediation as we anticipate we will be obligated to make these payments These payments could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations Reimbursements from state trust funds will be dependent on the maintenance and continued solvency of the various funds In the future we may incur substantial expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing or acquired locations We cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current and former locations that material environmental conditions not known to us do not exist that future laws ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability on us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our locations In addition failure to comply with any environmental laws ordinances or regulations or an increase in regulations could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations Failure to comply with state laws regulating the sale of alcohol and tobacco products may result in the loss of necessary licenses and the imposition of fines and penalties on us which could have a material effect on our business State laws regulate the sale of alcohol and tobacco products A violation or change of these laws could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations because state and local regulatory agencies have the power to approve revoke suspend or deny applications for and renewals of permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies Such a loss or imposition could have a material effect on our business In addition certain states regulate relationships including overlapping ownership among alcohol manufacturers wholesalers and retailers and may deny or revoke licensure if relationships in violation of the state laws exist We are not aware of any alcoholic beverage manufacturers or wholesalers having a prohibited relationship with our company Failure to comply with the other state and federal regulations we are subject to may result in penalties or costs that could have a material effect on our business O ur business is subject to various other state and federal regulations including without limitation employment laws and regulations minimum wage requirements overtime requirements working condition requirements and other laws and regulations Any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate income or overtime pay or impact of mandated healthcare benefits would likely result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums or regulations could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding climate change and greenhouse gas GHG emissions have accelerated recently in the United States GHGs are certain gases including carbon dioxide that may be contributing to global warming and other climatic changes For example in December the EPA issued an endangerment finding that GHGs endanger public health and welfare and that GHG emissions from motor vehicles contribute to the threat of climate change Although EPA s endangerment finding does not itself impose any requirements it does allow EPA to proceed with among other things proposed rules regulating GHG emissions from motor vehicles The EPA s endangerment finding has recently been upheld in federal court T hese and other governmental climate change or GHG reduction initiatives are enacted they could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations by increasing our regulatory compliance expenses increasing our fuel costs and or decreasing customer demand for fuel sold at our locations We depend on one principal supplier for the majority of our merchandise A disruption in supply or a change in our relationship could have a material effect on our business The majority of our general merchandise including most tobacco products and grocery items is purchased from a single wholesale grocer McLane We have a contract with McLane through December but we may not be able to renew the contract when it expires or on similar terms A change of merchandise suppliers a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal merchandise suppliers could have a material effect on our business cost of goods sold financial condition and results of operations We depend on three principal suppliers for the majority of our fuel A disruption in supply or a change in our relationship could have a material effect on our business During fiscal Marathon BP and CITGO supplied the majority of our fuel purchases Our contract s with these fuel suppliers expire at various times Refer to Part I Fuel Operations of this Annual Report on Form K for further information regarding expiration dates of our fuel contracts At this time we cannot provide assurance that our contract with CITGO will automatically renew or that we will be able to renew our BP or Marathon contracts upon expiration A change of suppliers a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal suppliers or a failure to purchase required minimum volumes under our fuel agreements could materially increase our cost of goods sold which would negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations CITGO obtains a significant portion of the crude oil it refines from its ultimate parent Petroleos de Venezuela SA PDVSA which is owned and controlled by the government of Venezuela The political and economic environment in Venezuela can disrupt PDVSA s operations and adversely affect CITGO s ability to obtain crude oil In addition the Venezuelan government can order and in the past has ordered PDVSA to curtail the production of oil in response to a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production The inability of CITGO to obtain crude oil in sufficient quantities would adversely affect its ability to provide fuel to us and could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations Because we depend on our senior management s experience and knowledge of our industry we would be adversely affected if we were to lose any members of our senior management team We are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management team The Board of Directors appointed Dennis G Hatchell as President and Chief Executive Officer effective March Patrick J Venezia became our Senior Vice President of Operations effective September O ur Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Mark R Bierley resigned effective May and m anagement is actively conducting a search for Mr Bierley s replacement If for any reason our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or management is unable to successfully locate a successor for Mr Bierley our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected We may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior personnel as needed in the future In addition we do not maintain key personnel life insurance on our senior executives and other key employees We also rely on our ability to recruit qualified store and field managers If we fail to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels our operating results may be adversely affected Pending or future litigation could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows We are from time to time party to various legal actions in the course of our business and an adverse outcome in such litigation could adversely affect o u r business financial condition and results of operations Refer to Part I Item Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form K for further information regarding our litigation Litigation and publicity concerning food quality health and other related issues could result in significant liabilities or litigation costs and cause consumers to avoid our convenience stores Convenience store businesses and other foodservice operators can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government agencies resulting from food quality illness or other health or environmental concerns or operating issues stemming from one or more locations Lack of fresh food handling experience among our workforce increases the risk of food borne illness resulting in litigation and reputational damage Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us regardless of whether the allegations are true by discouraging customers from purchasing fuel merchandise or food at one or more of our convenience stores We could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us Even if we are successful in defending such litigation our litigation costs could be significant and the litigation may divert time and money away from our operations and adversely affect our performance Pending SEC matters could adversely affect us On July we determined that we would restate earnings for the period from fiscal to fiscal arising from sale leaseback accounting for certain transactions In connection with our decision to restate we filed a Form K on July as well as a Form K A on August restating the transactions The SEC issued a comment letter to us in connection with the Form K and we responded to the comments Beginning in September we received requests from the SEC that we voluntarily provide certain information to the SEC s taff in connection with our sale leaseback accounting our decision to restate our financial statements with respect to sale leaseback accounting and other lease accounting matters In November the SEC informed us that in connection with the inquiry it had issued a formal order of private investigation As previously disclosed we are cooperating with the SEC in this ongoing investigation We are unable to predict how long this investigation will continue or whether it will result in any adverse action If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to accurately report our financial results As a result current and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting which c ould harm our business and the trading price of our stock Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports If we cannot provide reliable financial reports our business and operating results could be harmed The Sarbanes Oxley Act of as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC NASDAQ and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies These laws rules and regulations including compliance with Section of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made many activities more time consuming and more burdensome These laws rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases As a result their application in practice may evolve over time as regulatory and governing bodies provide new guidance which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters The costs of compliance with these laws rules and regulations have adversely affected our financial results Moreover we run the risk of non compliance which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our stock We have in the past discovered and may in the future discover areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement We have devoted significant resources to remediate our deficiencies and improve our internal control over financial reporting Although we believe that these efforts have strengthened our internal control over financial reporting we are continuing to work to improve our internal control over financial reporting Any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations Inferior internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock The dangers inherent in the storage of fuel could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses costs or liabilities We store fuel in storage tanks at our retail locations Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing fuel These hazards and risks include but are not limited to fires explosions spills discharges and other releases any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions environmental pollution governmentally imposed fines or clean up obligations personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others Any such event could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business We depend on information technology systems IT systems to manage numerous aspects of our business transactions and provide information to management Our IT systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies and a serious disruption to our IT systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently These systems are vulnerable to among other things damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters computer system and network failures loss of telecommunications services physical and electronic loss of data security breaches computer viruses and laws and regulations necessitating mandatory upgrades and timelines with which we may not be able to comply Any serious disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our operating results Our business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer employee or vendor data or to comply with applicable regulations relating to data security and privacy In the normal course of our business as a fuel and merchandise retailer we obtain large amounts of personal data including credit and debit card information from our customers While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our information technology and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer employee and vendor data provided to us a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material effect on our reputation operating results and financial condition Such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks Also a material failure on our part to comply with regulations relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data or to the privacy rights of our customers employees and others could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits O ur store improvement strategies require significant resources which if they are not completed successfully may divert our resources from more productive uses and harm our financial results We expect to devote significant resources to our store improvement strategies which include re modeling and or re branding certain stores There can be no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or that they will represent the most productive use of our resources If we are unabl e to successfully implement our store improvement strategies or if these strategies do not yield the expected benefits our financial results may be harmed In addition our experience is that re branding our stores often results in a temporary loss of sales at the applicable stores If such reductions in sales are larger or longer in duration than we expect we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our initiatives which could adversely affect our operating results We may not be successful in our efforts to divest non core stores and may have on going liabilities with respect to divested or dealer operated properties We periodically review our store portfolio to identify those stores that due to their performance location or other characteristics merit investment on an on going basis We attempt to divest the remaining stores and other non strategic assets through a variety of means including asset sales leases and subleases of property and dealer arrangements There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify acceptable parties to purchase or lease the assets or operate the stores that we desire to divest In addition we may remain liable or contingently liable for obligations relating to the divested or dealer operated properties and there can be no assurance that the other party to a transaction will be able to satisfy its indemnification or other obligations to us Other Risks Future sales of additional shares into the market may depress the market price of our common stock If we or our existing stockholders sell shares of our common stock in the public market including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or if the market perceives such sales or issuances could occur the market price of our common stock could decline As of December there were shares of our common stock outstanding most of which are freely tradable unless held by one of our affiliates Pursuant to Rule under the Securities Act of as amended during any three month period our affiliates can resell up to the greater of a of our aggregate outstanding common stock or b the average weekly trading volume for the four weeks prior to the sale Sales by our existing stockholders also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions In addition we have filed with the SEC a registration statement that covers up to shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options currently outstanding under our Stock Option Plan as well as a registration statement that covers up to million shares issuable pursuant to share based awards under our Omnibus Plan plus any options issued under our Stock Option Plan that are forfeited or cancelled after March Generally shares registered on a registration statement may be sold freely at any time after issuance Any issuance of shares of our common stock in the future could have a dilutive effect on your investment We may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable even if we do not have an immediate need for capital at that time In other circumstances we may issue shares of our common stock pursuant to existing agreements or arrangements The market price for our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline There currently is a public market for our common stock but there is no assurance that there will always be such a market Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations This market volatility could significantly affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance In addition the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors among others A deviation in our results from the expectation of public market analysts and investors Statements by research analysts about our common stock our C ompany or our industry Changes in market valuations of companies in our industry and market evaluations of our industry generally Additions or departures of key personnel Actions taken by our competitors Sales or other issuances of common stock by us or our senior officers or other affiliates or Other general economic political or market conditions many of which are beyond our control Provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and Delaware law may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders These provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws Authorize the issuance of up to five million shares of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt without further stockholder approval Prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors Limit who may call special meetings Limit stockholder action by written consent generally requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders and Establish advance notice requirements for any stockholder that wants to propose a matter to be acted upon by stockholders at a stockholders meeting including the nomination of candidates for election to our Board of Directors We are also subject to the provisions of Section of the Delaware General Corporation Law which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of or more of our outstanding voting stock that our Board of Directors has not approved These provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and may apply even if some of our stockholders consider the proposed transaction beneficial to them For example these provisions might discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock These provisions could also limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock We may in the future adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders Such measures may be adopted without vote or action by our stockholders Item B Unresolved Staff Comments Item Properties As of September we own the real property at of our stores and lease the real property at stores Management believes that none of these leases are individually material Most of these leases are net leases requiring us to pay all costs related to the property including taxes insurance and maintenance costs Certain of these leases are accounted for as lease finance obligations whereby the leased assets and related lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets The aggregate rent paid in fiscal for operating leases and leases accounted for as lease finance obligations was million and million respectively The following table lists our leases by calendar year of expiration Lease Expiration With Renewal Options Without Renewal Options Total Leased Management anticipates that it will be able to negotiate acceptable extensions of the leases that expire for those locations that we intend to continue operating We do not believe early termination of these leases would result in significant penalties to us When appropriate we have chosen to sell and then lease back properties Factors leading to this decision include alternative desires for use of cash beneficial taxation minimization of the risks associated with owning the property especially changes in valuation due to population shifts urbanization and or proximity to high volume streets and the economic terms of such lease finance transactions We own a two story square foot office building in Cary North Carolina that functions as our corporate headquarters We also own a three story square foot corporate support building in Sanford North Carolina and lease our corporate annex buildings in Sanford North Carolina We believe that we will continue to have adequate office space for the foreseeable future Item Legal Proceedings Since the beginning of fiscal over class action lawsuits have been filed in federal courts across the country against numerous companies in the petroleum industry Major petroleum companies and significant retailers in the industry have been named as defendants in these lawsuits Initially we were named as a defendant in eight of these cases three of which have recently been dismissed without prejudice We remain as a defendant in five cases one in North Carolina Neese et al v Abercrombie Oil Company Inc et al E D N C No cv FL filed one in Alabama Cook et al v Chevron USA Inc et al N D Ala No cv WKW CSC filed one in Georgia Rutherford et al v Murphy Oil USA Inc et al No cv HLM filed one in Tennessee Shields et al v RaceTrac Petroleum Inc et al No cv filed and one in South Carolina Korleski v BP Corporation North America Inc et al D S C No cv MDL filed Pursuant to an Order entered by the Joint Panel on Multi District Litigation all of the cases including those in which we are named have been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas and consolidated for all pre trial proceedings The plaintiffs in the lawsuits generally allege that they are retail purchasers who received less motor fuel than the defendants agreed to deliver because the defendants measured the amount of motor fuel they delivered in non temperature adjusted gallons which at higher temperatures contain less energy These cases seek among other relief an order requiring the defendants to install temperature adjusting equipment on their retail motor fuel dispensing devices In certain of the cases including some of the cases in which we are named plaintiffs also have alleged that because defendants pay fuel taxes based on temperature adjusted degree gallons but allegedly collect taxes from consumers on non temperature adjusted gallons defendants receive a greater amount of tax from consumers than they paid on the same gallon of fuel The plaintiffs in these cases seek among other relief recovery of excess taxes paid and punitive damages Both types of cases seek compensatory damages injunctive relief attorneys fees and costs and prejudgment interest The defendants filed motions to dismiss all cases for failure to state a claim which were denied by the court on February A number of the defendants including the Company subsequently moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or in the alternative for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs claims constitute non justiciable political questions The Court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on political question grounds on December and defendants request to appeal that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit was denied on August In May in a lawsuit in which we are not a party the Court granted class certification to Kansas fuel purchasers seeking implementation of automated temperature controls and or certain disclosures but deferred ruling on any class for damages Defendants sought permission to appeal that decision to the Tenth Circuit in June and that request was denied on August On November Defendants in the Kansas case filed a motion to decertify the Kansas classes in light of a new favorable United States Supreme Court decision On January the Judge denied the Defendants motion to decertify and granted the Plaintiffs motion to certify a class as to liability and injunctive relief aspects of Plaintiffs claims The court has continued to deny certification of a damages class On September the jury in the Kansas case returned a verdict in favor of defendants finding that defendants did not violate Kansas law by willfully fail ing t o disclose temperature and its e ffect on the energy content of motor fuel On October the judge in the Kansas case also ruled that defendants practice of selling motor fuel without disclosing temperature or disclosing the effect of temperature was not unconscionable under Kansas law We filed a motion on December requesting that cases filed in Arkansas and Virginia to neither of which we are party be remanded for further adjudication and the remaining cases be stayed until these two cases are concluded Plaintiffs requested that cases filed in California in which we are not a party be remanded for further adjudication and the remaining cases be stayed until the California cases are concluded We have opposed class certification and filed dispositive motions in each of the cases in which we have been sued At this stage of proceedings losses are reasonably possible however we cannot estimate our loss range of loss or liability if any related to these lawsuits because there are a number of unknown facts and unresolved legal issues that will impact the amount of any potential liability including without limitation i whether defendants are required or even permitted under state law to sell temperature adjusted gallons of motor fuel ii the amounts and actual temperature of fuel purchased by plaintiffs and iii whether or not class certification is proper in cases to which the Company is a party An adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material e ffect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows On October Patrick Amason on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated individuals filed suit against The Pantry in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama Western Division Patrick Amason v Kangaroo Express and The Pantry Inc No CV P W On September a first amended complaint was filed adding Enger McConnell on behalf of herself and a putative class of similarly situated individuals The plaintiffs seek class action status and allege that The Pantry included more information than is permitted on electronically printed credit and debit card receipts in willful violation of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act codified at U S C c g The amended complaint alleges that i plaintiff Patrick Amason seeks to represent a subclass of those class members as to whom the Company printed receipts containing the first four and last four digits of their credit and or debit card numbers and ii Plaintiff Enger McConnell seeks to represent a subclass of those class members as to whom the Company printed receipts containing all digits of their credit and or debit card numbers The plaintiffs seek an award of statutory damages of to for each alleged willful violation of the statute as well as attorneys fees costs punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the alleged unlawful practice On July the court denied plaintiffs initial motion for class certification but granted the plaintiffs the right to file an amended motion On October Plaintiff filed an amended motion for class certification seeking to certify two classes The first purported class represented by Mr Amason consists of A all natural persons whose credit and or debit card was used at an in store point of sale owned or operated by the Company from June through the date of the final judgment in the action B where the transaction was in a Company store located in the State of Alabama and C in connection with the transaction a receipt was printed by Retalix software containing the first four and last four digits of the credit debit card number on the receipt provided to the customer The second purported class represented by Ms McConnell consists of A all natural persons whose credit and or debit card was used at an in store point of sale owned or operated by the Company from June through the date of the final judgment in the action and B in connection with the transaction a receipt was printed containing all of the digits of the credit debit card numbers on the receipt provided to the customer The Company is opposing the motion for class certification and also has made a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claims on the basis that the plaintiffs lack standing or alternatively to stay the case until the Supreme Court of the United States rules in First American Financial Corp v Edwards another case involving a standing issue On January the Court issued an order staying the case until a decision is issued in the Edwards case and subsequently administratively terminated plaintiffs motion for class certification subject to plaintiffs right to refile the motion after the stay is removed On June the Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the writ of certiorari in the Edwards case as having been improvidently granted an action that has no precedential effect on our case The parties filed a Joint Report to the Court on July requesting that plaintiffs Renewed Motion for Class Certification and our Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing be deemed refiled At this stage of the proceedings losses are reasonably possible however we cannot reasonably estimate our loss range of loss or liability if any related to this lawsuit because there are a number of unknown facts and unresolved legal issues that will impact the amount of our potential liability including without limitation i whether the plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims ii whether a class or classes will be certified iii if a class or classes are certified the identity and number of the putative class members and iv if a class or classes are certified the resolution of certain unresolved statutory interpretation issues that may impact the size of the putative class es and whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages An adverse outcome in this litigation could have a material e ffect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows We are party to various other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business We believe these other actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty management s present judgment is that the resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows If however our assessment of these actions is inaccurate or there are any significant adverse developments in these actions our business financial condition results of operations and cash could be materially affected Item Mine Safety Disclosures PART II Item Market for Registrant s Common Equity Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

gas fired and geothermal power plants in North America and have a significant presence in major competitive wholesale power markets in California Texas and the Mid Atlantic region of the U S We sell wholesale power steam capacity renewable energy credits and ancillary services to our customers which include utilities independent electric system operators industrial and agricultural companies retail power providers municipalities power marketers and others We have invested in clean power generation to become a recognized leader in developing constructing owning and operating an environmentally responsible portfolio of power plants We purchase natural gas and fuel oil as fuel for our power plants engage in related natural gas transportation and storage transactions and we purchase electric transmission rights to deliver power to our customers We also enter into natural gas and power physical and financial contracts to hedge certain business risks and optimize our portfolio of power plants Our goal is to be recognized as the premier independent power company in the U S as measured by our employees customers regulators shareholders and communities in which our facilities are located We seek to achieve sustainable growth through financially disciplined power plant development construction acquisition operation and ownership We will continue to pursue opportunities to improve our fleet performance and reduce operating costs In order to manage our various physical assets and contractual obligations we will continue to execute commodity agreements within the guidelines of our Risk Management Policy We assess our business on a regional basis due to the impact on our financial performance of the differing characteristics of these regions particularly with respect to competition regulation and other factors impacting supply and demand Our reportable segments are West including geothermal Texas North including Canada and Southeast Our portfolio including partnership interests includes power plants including under construction located throughout states in the U S and Canada with an aggregate generation capacity of MW and MW under construction Our generation capacity includes natural gas fired power plants geothermal plants and photovoltaic solar plant consisting of approximately MW of baseload capacity from our Geysers Assets and MW of baseload capacity from our cogeneration power plants MW of intermediate load capacity from our combined cycle combustion turbines and MW of peaking capacity from our simple cycle combustion turbines and duct fired capability which includes approximately MW of capacity from solar photovoltaic power generation technology located in New Jersey Our segments have an aggregate generation capacity of MW with an additional MW under construction in the West MW in Texas MW in the North and MW in the Southeast Our Geysers Assets included in our West segment have generation capacity of approximately MW from operating geothermal power plants and we have begun expansion efforts to increase our generation capacity at our Geysers Assets Current Year Operational Developments We continue to make significant progress to maintain financially disciplined growth to enhance shareholder value and to set the foundation for continued growth and success with the following achievements during the year ended December Our York Energy Center a MW dual fuel combined cycle power plant achieved COD on March and began selling power under a six year PPA with a third party which commenced on June Construction of our Russell City Energy Center which closed on construction financing in June and upgrades at our Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility which closed on construction financing in August continue to move forward with expected completion dates in We continue to move forward with our turbine upgrade program Through December we have completed the upgrade of ten Siemens and five GE turbines and have agreed to upgrade approximately six additional Siemens and GE turbines and may upgrade additional turbines in the future Our turbine upgrade program is expected to increase our generation capacity in total by approximately MW This upgrade program began in the fourth quarter of and is scheduled through The upgraded turbines have been operating with Heat Rates consistent with expectations We continue to look to expand our production from our Geysers Assets Beginning in the fourth quarter of we conducted an exploratory drilling program which effectively proved the commercial viability of the steam field in the northern part of our Geysers Assets We have received Conditional Use Permits from Sonoma County and are pursuing the additional required permitting We are pursuing commercial arrangements which will need to be in place prior to commencing expansion activities We continue to believe our northern Geysers Assets have potential for development In the meantime we have connected certain test wells to our existing power plants to capture incremental production from those wells while continuing with the permitting process baseline engineering work and sales efforts for an expansion Throughout our plant operating personnel achieved the first quartile performance for employee lost time incident rate for fossil fuel electric power generation companies with or more employees We produced over billion KWh in Our entire fleet achieved a forced outage factor of We achieved fleet wide starting reliability in During our Turbine Maintenance Group completed major inspections and hot gas path inspections For the past eleven consecutive years our Geysers Assets have reliably generated approximately million MWh per year and in achieved an exceptional availability factor of approximately Enhancing Shareholder Value We continue to make significant progress to maintain financially disciplined growth to enhance shareholder value through our capital allocation and share repurchases and to set the foundation for continued growth and success Given our strong cash flow from operations we are committed to remaining financially disciplined in our capital allocation decisions The year ended December was marked by the following accomplishments Our total shareholder return for was measured by the year over year change in our stock price On August we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock Through the filing of this Report a total of shares of our outstanding common stock have been repurchased under this program for approximately million at an average price paid of per share We issued our First Lien Notes terminated our First Lien Credit Facility and extended our corporate debt maturities Together these changes eliminated the more restrictive of our debt covenants resulting in increased operational strategic and financial flexibility in managing our capital resources including the flexibility to reinvest more earnings for organic growth issue and or buyback shares of our common stock and incur additional debt if needed for acquisitions or development projects Additionally we achieved attractive yields and a maturity schedule stretching from to with no more than billion of corporate debt maturing in any given year We have further continued to reduce our overall cost of debt and simplify our capital structure by refinancing subsidiary level debt with corporate level term loans eliminating the need for subsidiary level reporting and the potential for cash to be temporarily trapped at the subsidiary level On March we closed on the billion Term Loan and used the net proceeds received together with operating cash on hand to fully retire the approximately billion NDH Project Debt in accordance with its repayment terms On June we repaid approximately million of project debt with the proceeds received from million in borrowings under the New Term Loan On June we closed on the approximately million Russell City Project Debt to fund the construction of Russell City Energy Center and on August we closed on the million Los Esteros Project Debt to fund the upgrade of our Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility During the fourth quarter of the U S Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the Chapter cases that remained open against the U S Debtors thus all matters related to our voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code filed in and are resolved and closed For a further discussion of our significant financing transactions completed in see Liquidity and Capital Resources Customer Oriented Origination Business We continue to focus on providing products and services that are beneficial to our customers A summary of certain significant contracts entered into or approved in is as follows We have entered into a new ten year PPA with Entergy Texas to provide MW of power generated by our Carville Energy Center which will commence in June We have entered into a new tolling agreement with Southern California Edison to provide MW of power generated by our Pastoria Energy Center which will commence in and we executed a new resource adequacy contract with the same counterparty for MW from our Pastoria Energy Center which will commence in We have entered into a PPA with Tampa Electric Company for the full output of our Auburndale Peaking Energy Center which commenced in November and will run through December Our Regulatory and Environmental Profile We are subject to complex and stringent energy environmental and other governmental laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels in connection with the development ownership and operation of our power plants Federal and state legislative and regulatory actions continue to change how our business is regulated The EPA is moving forward on climate change regulation and has already promulgated regulations related to other air pollutant emissions and some states and regions in the U S have implemented or are considering implementing regulations to reduce GHG emissions We are actively participating in these debates at the federal regional and state levels For a further discussion of the environmental and other governmental regulations that affect us see Governmental and Regulatory Matters in Item of this Report Although we cannot predict the ultimate effect future climate change regulations or legislation could have on our business we believe that we will be less adversely impacted by potential cap and trade limits carbon taxes or required environmental upgrades as a result of future potential regulation or legislation addressing GHG other air emissions as well as water use or emissions than compared to our competitors who use other fossil fuels or steam condensation technologies Since our inception in we have been a leader in environmental stewardship and have invested in clean power generation to become a recognized leader in developing constructing owning and operating an environmentally responsible portfolio of power plants The combination of our Geysers Assets and our high efficiency portfolio of natural gas fired power plants results in substantially lower emissions of these gases compared to our competitors power plants using other fossil fuels such as coal Consequently our power generation portfolio has the lowest GHG footprint per MWh of any major independent power producer in the U S In addition we strive to preserve our nation s valuable water and land resources To condense steam we primarily use cooling towers with a closed water cooling system or air cooled condensers Since our plants are modern and efficient and utilize clean burning natural gas we do not require large areas of land for our power plants nor do we require large specialized landfills for the disposal of coal ash or nuclear plant waste Our Market and Our Key Financial Performance Drivers The market Spark Spread sales of RECs revenues from our PPAs and steam sales and the results from our marketing hedging and optimization activities are the primary drivers of our Commodity Margin and contribute significantly to our financial results The market Spark Spread is primarily impacted by fuel prices weather and reserve margins which impact both our supply and demand fundamentals Those factors plus the relationship between our operating Heat Rate compared to the Market Heat Rate our power plant operating performance and availability are key to our financial performance Fluctuations in natural gas price levels affect our Commodity Margin depending on our hedge levels and holding other factors constant When less efficient higher cost natural gas fired units set power prices in our regional markets higher natural gas prices tend to increase our Commodity Margin In these instances while our production costs increase when gas prices are higher our competitors costs and power prices increase at a greater rate leading to higher Commodity Margin Similarly when natural gas prices decline our Commodity Margin tends to decline Natural gas prices have declined substantially in recent years and natural gas fired combined cycle units are now frequently cheaper to dispatch than coal fired power plants This has led to coal to gas switching greater use of natural gas fired units and lower production from coal fired units during many hours When coal fired electricity production costs exceed natural gas fired production costs coal fired units tend to set power prices In these hours lower natural gas prices tend to increase our Commodity Margin since our production costs fall while power prices remain constant depending on our hedge levels and holding other factors constant Efficient operation of our fleet creates the opportunity to capture Commodity Margin in a cost effective manner However unplanned outages during periods when Commodity Margin is positive could result in a loss of that opportunity We generally measure our fleet performance based on our availability factors Heat Rate and plant operating expense The higher our availability factor the better positioned we are to capture Commodity Margin The less natural gas we must consume for each MWh of power generated the lower our Heat Rate The lower our operating Heat Rate compared to the Market Heat Rate the more favorable the impact on our Commodity Margin Holding all other factors constant our Commodity Margin increases when we are able to lower our operating Heat Rate compared to the Market Heat Rate and conversely decreases when our operating Heat Rate increases compared to the Market Heat Rate See also The Market for Power Our Power Markets and Market Fundamentals in Item of this Report for additional information on how these factors impact our Commodity Margin RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER AND Below are our results

respectively which are components of Commodity Margin Represents generation and capacity from power plants that we both consolidate and operate See Description of Our Power Plants Table of Operating Power Plants and Projects Under Construction for our total equity generation and capacities We evaluate our commodity revenue and commodity expense on a collective basis because the price of power and natural gas tend to move together as the price for power is generally determined by the variable operating cost of the next marginal generator to be dispatched to meet demand The spread between our commodity revenue and commodity expense represents a significant portion of our Commodity Margin Our financial performance is correlated to how we maximize our Commodity Margin through management of our portfolio of power plants as well as our hedging and optimization activities See additional segment discussion in Commodity Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Commodity revenue net of commodity expense increased million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due to an increase in the North primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition which closed on July and our York Energy Center which achieved COD in March partially offset by the negative impact in Texas of unplanned outages at some of our power plants caused by an extreme cold weather event in early February which required us to purchase physical replacement power at prices substantially above our hedged price despite a higher contribution from hedges commodity revenue net of commodity expense decreased in the West primarily due to lower Spark Spreads resulting from a significant increase in hydroelectric generation in California in compared to and a decrease in the Southeast primarily due to the expiration of certain hedge contracts which benefited the year ended December Our average total MW in operation increased by MW or primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition which closed on July and our York Energy Center which achieved COD in March partially offset by the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant in December Generation increased due primarily to higher generation in the North due to the Conectiv Acquisition and our York Energy Center and higher generation in Texas driven by extreme heat and drought conditions during the third quarter of The increase in generation was partially offset by lower generation in the West resulting from weaker price conditions which also largely contributed to a decrease in our average capacity factor excluding peakers in compared to Unrealized mark to market earnings from hedging our future generation and fuel needs had an unfavorable variance of million primarily driven by the realization of favorable hedge positions in reported in mark to market activity at December resulting in an unfavorable period over period change partially offset by unrealized gains on fuel and purchased energy positions reported at December Other revenue decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December due primarily to million of amortization expense on intangible contract values related to a contract that became effective in In addition there was a decrease in other revenue of million due to an adjustment related to prior periods on a major maintenance contract which resulted in higher revenue recognized in the second quarter of Plant operating expense increased by million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Our normal recurring plant operating expense decreased million and costs related to unscheduled outages decreased million due largely to insurance recoveries for the year ended December compared to the year ended December The increase in plant operating expense was primarily due to an increase of million related to our Mid Atlantic assets acquired in the Conectiv Acquisition an increase of million related to our York Energy Center which achieved COD in March an increase of million in major maintenance expense resulting from our plant outage schedule an increase of million in costs from scrap parts related to outages an increase in costs of million related to our voluntary departure incentive program which was initiated in the second quarter of and an increase of million in stock based compensation expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from a decrease of million due to rotable parts being fully depreciated for some of our units a decrease of million related to a revision in the expected settlement dates of the asset retirement obligations of our power plants and a decrease of million due to the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant in December The decrease was partially offset by an increase of million related to our Mid Atlantic assets acquired in the Conectiv Acquisition an increase of million related to York Energy Center which achieved COD in March and an increase of million related to depreciation for assets placed into service during Sales general and other administrative expense decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from million in Conectiv acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December The decrease was partially offset by million due to the reversal of a bad debt allowance in the first quarter of as a result of Lyondell Chemical Co s emergence from Chapter bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court s acceptance of our claim in the first quarter of Other operating expenses decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December resulting from a decrease of million in operating lease expense due to our purchase from a third party of the entity that held the lease of our South Point power plant in December and a decrease of million in royalty expense due to lower revenues from our Geysers Assets resulting from lower prices in compared to Impairment losses for the year ended December consisted of an impairment of approximately million related to South Point see Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our acquisition of the South Point lease and subsequent impairment of our South Point assets and approximately million associated with two development projects that originated prior to our Chapter bankruptcy proceedings During the third quarter of we learned the projects would not receive PPAs that would support their continued development and made the determination that continued development was unlikely Gain on sale of assets net consists of a million gain recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Income from unconsolidated investments in power plants had a favorable variance for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due to a million period over period increase in operating income for Greenfield LP related to mechanical issues which impacted plant performance during the third quarter of Interest expense decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due to a million favorable change in unrealized mark to market activity related to the interest rate swaps hedging our variable rate debt that do not qualify for hedge accounting and a decrease of million due to capitalized interest related to project debt for two of our facilities under construction Also contributing to the favorable period over period change in interest expense was a decrease in our annual effective interest rate on our consolidated debt excluding the impacts of capitalized interest and unrealized gains losses on interest rate swaps which decreased to for the year ended December from for the year ended December Loss on interest rate derivatives had a favorable change of million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from a period over period decrease of million in historical unrealized losses previously deferred in AOCI and reclassified into income related to interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans The favorable change was partially offset by an unfavorable period over period change of approximately million due to realized interest rate swap settlements and changes in fair value subsequent to the reclassification date of the interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans Also contributing to the unfavorable period over period change was an increase of million resulting from interest rate swap breakage costs related to the repayment of project debt in June Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December primarily consisted of million associated with the repayment of the NDH Project Debt in March million associated with the retirement of the First Lien Credit Facility term loans in January in connection with the issuance of the First Lien Notes and million related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the repayment of project debt in June See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the issuance of the First Lien Notes the repayment of the NDH Project Debt and the repayment of other project debt Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December consisted of million associated with the retirement of term loans under the First Lien Credit Facility in May July and October in connection with the issuance of the and First Lien Notes and million associated with the acquisition of the Broad River lease which was accounted for as a refinancing of existing debt under U S GAAP See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of the Broad River lease During the year ended December we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to million for the year ended December The period over period change primarily resulted from an unfavorable variance in income tax expense of million related to the application of intraperiod tax allocation and an increase in various state and foreign jurisdiction income taxes of million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December The unfavorable variance in income tax expense was partially offset by a decrease in federal income tax of million due primarily from a one time million benefit to reduce our valuation allowance due to the election to consolidate the CCFC group with the Calpine group for for federal income tax reporting purposes and a decrease of million due to the expiration of a statute of limitation related to an uncertain tax position See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the election to consolidate the CCFC group and the Calpine group for federal tax reporting purposes Income from discontinued operations for the year ended December primarily consisted of million associated with the gain net of tax on the sale of our ownership interests in Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain in December Also included in the income from discontinued operations for the year ended December are the results of operations for Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion

respectively which are components of Commodity Margin Represents generation and capacity from power plants that we both consolidate and operate See Description of Our Power Plants Table of Operating Power Plants and Projects Under Construction for our total equity generation and capacities We evaluate our commodity revenue and commodity expense on a collective basis because the price of power and natural gas tend to move together as the price for power is generally determined by the variable operating cost of the next marginal generator to be dispatched to meet demand The spread between our commodity revenue and commodity expense represents a significant portion of our Commodity Margin Our financial performance is correlated to how we maximize our Commodity Margin through management of our portfolio of power plants as well as our hedging and optimization activities See additional segment discussion in Commodity Margin and Adjusted EBITDA Commodity revenue net of commodity expense decreased million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due to lower average hedge margins in compared to lower realized Spark Spreads on open positions due to lower Market Heat Rates primarily in California and Texas attributable to weaker market conditions resulting from milder weather and increased hydroelectric generation in the West and an increase in installed generation capacity in California and Texas in compared to partially offset by an increase in the North primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition which closed on July Our average total MW in operation increased by MW or primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition and OMEC which achieved commercial operations in October and was consolidated on January Generation increased due primarily to the Conectiv Acquisition and stronger market price conditions in the North partially offset by weaker market price conditions in California and Texas Unrealized mark to market earnings from hedging our future generation and fuel needs increased by million primarily driven by the impact of lower gas prices on our forward short financial gas position partially offset by losses recognized on our short power Heat Rate swap position held at December Other revenue increased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December due primarily to million in revenue recognized in which included a million adjustment related to prior periods on a maintenance contract This increase was partially offset by a decrease of million related to an operations and maintenance contract that expired in March Plant operating expense was unchanged for the year ended December compared to the year ended December despite a MW increase in our average total MW in operation over the same periods During compared to we experienced a decrease of million in normal recurring plant operating expense a decrease of million in costs from scrap parts related to outages a million decrease in major maintenance resulting from our plant outage schedule and a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense related to plant personnel costs The decrease in plant operating expense was offset by an increase related to the Conectiv Acquisition and OMEC which achieved commercial operations in October and was consolidated on January and a million increase related to costs incurred for unscheduled outages Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from an increase of million due to a revision in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of our power plants and related equipment and changing our Geysers Assets depreciation from the units of production method to the straight line method See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our change in useful lives and salvage values as well as our change from the units of production method to the straight line depreciation method for our Geysers Assets Also contributing to the increase was million in depreciation and amortization expense related to the Conectiv Acquisition and million related to OMEC which achieved commercial operation in October and was consolidated on January Sales general and other administrative expense decreased for the year ended December compared to the year December due to a million decrease in personnel costs due largely to lower stock based compensation expense and temporary labor costs a million favorable change in our bad debt expense primarily related to a million reversal of our bad debt allowance in the first quarter of as a result of Lyondell Chemical Co s emergence from Chapter bankruptcy and the bankruptcy court s acceptance of our claim and a million decrease in consulting expense The decrease was partially offset by million in Conectiv acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December Impairment losses for the year ended December consisted of an impairment of approximately million related to South Point see Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our acquisition of the South Point lease and subsequent impairment of our South Point assets and approximately million associated with two development projects that originated prior to our Chapter bankruptcy proceedings During the third quarter of we learned the projects would not receive PPAs that would support their continued development and made the determination that continued development was unlikely Gain on sale of assets net consists of a million gain recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information Income from unconsolidated investments in power plants decreased by million for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due to the consolidation of OMEC on January During the year ended December OMEC recorded income of million which largely consisted of a million gain related to mark to market activity from interest rate swap contracts See Notes and of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our consolidation of OMEC and unconsolidated investments respectively Interest expense decreased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily due a decrease of million resulting from the repayment in February of the notes related to PCF and PCF III a decrease of million related to the refinancing of our CCFC Old Notes CCFC Term Loans and the CCFCP Preferred Shares in and a decrease in the annualized effective interest rates on our consolidated debt excluding the impacts of capitalized interest and unrealized gains losses on interest rate swaps which decreased to for the year ended December from for the year ended December The decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in interest expense related to the NDH Project Debt incurred in the second half of and a million increase related to the consolidation of OMEC on January Loss on interest rate derivatives had an unfavorable change of million for the year ended December due to the reclassification of approximately million in historical unrealized losses previously deferred in AOCI related to interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility and approximately million related to realized swap settlements subsequent to the reclassification date and the changes in fair value subsequent to the de designation date of the interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December consisted of million associated with the retirement of term loans under the First Lien Credit Facility in May July and October in connection with the issuance of the and First Lien Notes and million associated with the acquisition of the Broad River lease which was accounted for as a refinancing of existing debt under U S GAAP See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our acquisition of the Broad River lease Debt extinguishment costs for the year ended December consisted of million associated with the retirement of the term loans under the First Lien Credit Facility in October the refinancing of our CCFC Old Notes and CCFC Term Loans in May and June respectively and the CCFCP Preferred Shares that were redeemed on or before July During the year ended December we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended December The period over period change primarily resulted from a decrease of million related to the application of intraperiod tax allocation partially offset by an increase in federal income tax of million for the CCFC group for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Income from discontinued operations increased for the year ended December compared to the year ended December due largely to a million gain net of tax on the sale of our ownership interests in Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations Also included in the income from discontinued operations are the results of operations for Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain COMMODITY MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EBITDA We use Commodity Margin a non GAAP financial measure to assess our performance by our reportable segments Commodity Margin includes our power and steam revenues sales of purchased power and physical natural gas capacity revenue REC revenue sales of surplus emission allowances transmission revenue and expenses fuel and purchased energy expense fuel transportation expense RGGI compliance and other environmental costs and cash settlements from our marketing hedging and optimization activities including natural gas transactions hedging future power sales that are included in mark to market activity but excludes the unrealized portion of our mark to market activity and other revenues We believe that Commodity Margin is a useful tool for assessing the performance of our core operations and is a key operational measure reviewed by our chief operating decision maker Commodity Margin is not a measure calculated in accordance with U S GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented in accordance with U S GAAP Commodity Margin does not intend to represent income from operations the most comparable U S GAAP measure as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of Commodity Margin to income loss from operations by segment Commodity Margin by Segment for the Years Ended December and The following tables show our Commodity Margin and related operating performance metrics by segment for the years ended December and In the comparative tables below favorable variances are shown without brackets

in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate West Commodity Margin in our West segment for the year ended December was comparable to the year ended December During the year ended December we experienced higher Commodity Margin contribution from hedges as well as the positive impact of origination activities in compared to These positive factors were offset by lower Spark Spreads resulting from a significant increase in hydroelectric generation in California in compared to and lower Commodity Margin resulting from an unscheduled outage at OMEC during the second quarter of Consistent with weaker price conditions generation decreased for the year ended December compared to Average availability decreased by due to an increase in the duration of outages during the second quarter of compared to the second quarter of as the weaker price environment provided an opportunity to extend the duration of scheduled maintenance outages due to limited opportunity costs Our average total MW in operation decreased MW primarily due to the retirement of our Pittsburg power plant in March as well as the expiration of our operating lease and subsequent retirement of our Watsonville Monterey cogeneration power plant in May which was partially offset by an increase related to the completion of turbine upgrades at two of our power plants in Texas Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate Texas Commodity Margin in our Texas segment decreased by million or for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Despite an increase in Commodity Margin contributions from hedges Commodity Margin was negatively impacted by unplanned outages at some of our power plants caused by an extreme cold weather event which occurred on February Power prices increased dramatically as a result of the cold weather event and the plant outages which required us to purchase physical replacement power at prices substantially above our hedged prices Also contributing to the year over year decrease in Commodity Margin was the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant in December which also drove a MW or decrease in our average total MW in operation which was partially offset by an increase related to the completion of turbine upgrades at several of our power plants in and The decrease in Commodity Margin was partially offset by significantly higher power prices driven by extreme heat and drought conditions which increased Spark Spreads during the third quarter of on our relatively small open position North Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate North Commodity Margin in our North segment increased by million or primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition which closed on July and our York Energy Center which achieved COD in March which were both also the primary driver of the period over period increase in generation as well as the MW increase in average total MW in operation during the year ended December compared to the year ended December The increase in Commodity Margin was partially offset by lower capacity prices in the second half of compared to the same period in Average capacity factor excluding peakers increased primarily due to scheduled outages at two of our power plants in the fourth quarter of Southeast Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate Southeast Commodity Margin in our Southeast segment decreased by million or for the year ended December compared to the year ended December largely due to the expiration of certain hedge contracts which benefited the year ended December as well as lower Commodity Margin that resulted from unscheduled outages that occurred during the second and third quarters of Commodity Margin by Segment for the Years Ended December and The following tables show our Commodity Margin and related operating performance metrics by segment for the years ended December and In the comparative tables below favorable variances are shown without brackets while unfavorable variances are shown with brackets The MWh generated by segment below

availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate West Commodity Margin in our West segment decreased by million or for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from a decrease of million related to the expiration of the PCF arrangement in the fourth quarter of lower average hedge prices in compared to lower realized Spark Spreads on our open positions due to lower Market Heat Rates caused primarily by cooler temperatures in compared to and an overall increase in installed generation capacity as well as increased hydroelectric generation in California in Also contributing to the unfavorable period over period change was a decrease of million for the sale of surplus emission allowances in the first quarter of which did not reoccur in The decrease in Commodity Margin was partially offset by an increase of million related to higher REC revenue from new contracts associated with our Geysers Assets million from OMEC that achieved commercial operation in October and was consolidated on January and a million credit recognized in the second quarter of related to overcharges associated with a gas transportation contract Average total MW in operation increased MW or due primarily to OMEC which was partially offset by the retirement of our Pittsburg power plant in March as well as the expiration of the operating lease and subsequent retirement of our Watsonville Monterey cogeneration power plant in May Our average capacity factor excluding peakers decreased by for the year ended December compared to due to the weaker price conditions in compared to Texas Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate Texas Commodity Margin in our Texas segment decreased by million or for the year ended December compared to the year ended December primarily resulting from lower average hedge prices and lower realized Spark Spreads on open positions due to lower Market Heat Rates particularly with regard to June which did not benefit from the extreme heat congestion driven pricing and tighter reserve margin that occurred in June as well as an overall increase in installed generation capacity in ERCOT in compared to Generation increased driven by higher Spark Spreads in April as well as colder weather in January and February compared to the same periods in North Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate North Commodity Margin in our North segment increased by million primarily due to the Conectiv Acquisition which closed on July higher realized Spark Spreads on open positions driven by much warmer weather in the second and third quarters of compared to the same periods in as well as colder weather in the latter fourth quarter of compared to the same period in The Conectiv Acquisition led to a MW increase in our average total MW in operation as well as a MWh increase in generation while stronger market pricing led to a increase in generation among our legacy power plants for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Southeast Change Change Commodity Margin in millions Commodity Margin per MWh generated MWh generated in thousands Average availability Average total MW in operation Average capacity factor excluding peakers Steam Adjusted Heat Rate Southeast Commodity Margin in our Southeast segment decreased by million or for the year ended December compared to the year ended December Our power plants in the Western half of the region experienced lower realized Spark Spreads on open positions driven by lower Market Heat Rates Partially offsetting these negative impacts our power plants in the Eastern half of the region experienced higher realized Spark Spreads on open positions driven by higher Market Heat Rates caused primarily by warmer weather in May and June and cooler weather in the fourth quarter of compared to the same periods in In addition the overall decrease in Commodity Margin was partially offset by the non recurring negative impact from the settlement of a disputed steam contract in the second quarter of Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items described below and presented in the accompanying reconciliation Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with U S GAAP and should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented in accordance with U S GAAP Our Corporate Revolving Facility includes a similar measure as a basis for our material covenants under the debt agreement that excludes our net interest in our unconsolidated subsidiaries and includes distributions received from unconsolidated investments However we believe that inclusion of our share of the Adjusted EBITDA of our unconsolidated subsidiaries is useful in evaluating our overall performance and therefore we include Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments and exclude distributions received from our unconsolidated investments in our definition of Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to represent cash flows from operations or net income loss as defined by U S GAAP as an indicator of operating performance Furthermore Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies We believe Adjusted EBITDA is also used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods We believe that EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired Additionally we believe that investors commonly adjust EBITDA information to eliminate the effect of restructuring and other expenses which vary widely from company to company and impair comparability As we define it Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for the effects of impairment losses gains or losses on sales dispositions or retirements of assets any unrealized gains or losses from accounting for derivatives stock based compensation expense operating lease expense non cash gains and losses from foreign currency translations major maintenance expense gains or losses on the repurchase or extinguishment of debt and any other extraordinary unusual or non recurring items plus the Adjusted EBITDA from our discontinued operations and adjustments to reflect the Adjusted EBITDA from our unconsolidated investments We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes that these items would distort their ability to efficiently view and assess our core operating trends In summary our management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our Board of Directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance The

respectively Includes million included in sales general and other administrative expense and million included in plant operating expense LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our business is capital intensive Our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms In addition our ability to successfully operate our business is dependent on maintaining sufficient liquidity We believe that we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations to continue to meet our obligations as they become due Liquidity At December we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash Amounts available for future borrowings were million under our Corporate Revolving Facility The following table provides a summary of our liquidity position at December and in millions Cash and cash equivalents corporate Cash and cash equivalents non corporate Total cash and cash equivalents Restricted cash Revolving facility ies availability Letter of credit availability Total current liquidity availability ____________ Includes million and million of margin deposits held by us posted by our counterparties at December and respectively On December we executed our billion Corporate Revolving Facility which replaced our billion revolver under our First Lien Credit Facility At December the letters of credit issued under our First Lien Credit Facility were either replaced by letters of credit issued under our Corporate Revolving Facility or back stopped by an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by a third party Our letters of credit under our Corporate Revolving Facility at December include those that were back stopped of approximately million The back stopped letters of credit were returned and extinguished during the first quarter of The balance at December includes availability under the NDH Project Debt which was retired on March Includes availability under our CDHI letter of credit facility On January we increased the CDHI letter of credit facility to million and extended the maturity date to January Our principal source for future liquidity is cash flows generated from our operations Our principal uses of liquidity and capital resources outside of those required for our operations include but are not limited to collateral requirements to support our commercial hedging and optimization activities debt service obligations including principal and interest payments and capital expenditures for construction project development and other growth initiatives In addition we may use capital resources to opportunistically repurchase our shares of common stock The ultimate decision to allocate capital to share repurchases will be based upon the expected returns compared to alternative uses of capital We believe that cash on hand and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for our operations both in the near and longer term Cash Management We manage our cash in accordance with our cash management system subject to the requirements of our Corporate Revolving Facility and requirements under certain of our project debt and lease agreements or by regulatory agencies Our cash and cash equivalents as well as our restricted cash balances are invested in money market accounts with investment banks that are not FDIC insured We place our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash in what we believe to be creditworthy financial institutions and certain of our money market accounts invest in U S Treasury securities or other obligations issued or guaranteed by the U S Government its agencies or instrumentalities We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock Future cash dividends if any will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon among other things our future operations and earnings capital requirements general financial condition contractual and financing restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant Liquidity Sensitivity Significant changes in commodity prices and Market Heat Rates can have an impact on our liquidity as we use margin deposits cash prepayments and letters of credit as credit support collateral with and from our counterparties for commodity procurement and risk management activities Utilizing our portfolio of transactions subject to collateral exposure we estimate that as of January an increase of MMBtu in natural gas prices would result in an increase of collateral required by approximately million If natural gas prices decreased by MMBtu we estimate that our collateral requirements would decrease by approximately million Changes in Market Heat Rates also affect our liquidity For example as demand increases less efficient generation is dispatched which increases the Market Heat Rate and results in increased collateral requirements Historical relationships of natural gas and Market Heat Rate movements for our portfolio of assets have been volatile over time and are influenced by the absolute price of natural gas therefore we derived a statistical analysis that implies that a change of MMBtu in natural gas approximates an average Market Heat Rate change of Btu KWh at current natural gas price levels We estimate that at January an increase of Btu KWh in the Market Heat Rate would result in an increase in collateral required by approximately million If Market Heat Rates were to fall at a similar rate we estimate that our collateral required would decrease by million These amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts that could be required which may be higher or lower than the amounts estimated above and also exclude any correlation between the changes in natural gas prices and Market Heat Rates that may occur concurrently These sensitivities will change as new contracts or hedging activities are executed In order to effectively manage our future Commodity Margin we have economically hedged a portion of our generation and natural gas portfolio mostly through power and natural gas forward physical and financial transactions however we remain susceptible to significant price movements for and beyond In addition to the price of natural gas the future impact on our Commodity Margin is highly dependent on other factors such as the level of Market Heat Rates our continued ability to successfully hedge our Commodity Margin the speed strength and duration of an economic recovery maintaining acceptable availability levels for our fleet the impact of current and pending environmental regulations in the markets in which we participate improving the efficiency and profitability of our operations continued compliance with the covenants under our existing financing obligations including our First Lien Notes Term Loan New Term Loan Corporate Revolving Facility CCFC and other debt obligations stabilizing and increasing future contractual cash flows and our significant counterparties performing under their contracts with us Additionally scheduled outages related to the life cycle of our power plant fleet in addition to unscheduled outages may result in maintenance expenditures that are disproportionate in differing periods In order to manage such liquidity requirements we maintain additional liquidity availability in the form of our Corporate Revolving Facility noted in the table above letters of credit and the ability to issue first priority liens for collateral support It is difficult to predict future developments and the amount of credit support that we may need to provide should such conditions occur we experience another economic recession that persists for a significant period of time or energy commodity prices increase significantly Our letters of credit capital management construction upgrades and growth initiatives are further discussed below Letter of Credit Facilities The Corporate Revolving Facility represents our primary revolving facility The table below represents amounts issued under our letter of credit facilities at December and in millions Corporate Revolving Facility CDHI NDH Project Debt credit facility Various project financing facilities Total ___________ When we entered into our billion Corporate Revolving Facility on December the letters of credit issued under our First Lien Credit Facility were either replaced with letters of credit issued under our Corporate Revolving Facility or back stopped by an irrevocable standby letter of credit issued by a third party Our letters of credit under our Corporate Revolving Facility at December include those that were back stopped of approximately million The back stopped letters of credit were returned and extinguished during On January we increased the CDHI letter of credit facility to million and extended the maturity date to January We repaid and terminated the NDH Project Debt on March Capital Management and Significant Financing Transactions In connection with our goals of enhancing shareholder value and leveraging our three scale regions we have completed or initiated eight key capital and financing transactions during the year ended December as further described below Issuance of the First Lien Notes and Termination of the First Lien Credit Facility On January we issued the First Lien Notes which together with operating cash on hand were used to fully repay the remaining First Lien Credit Facility term loans thereby terminating the First Lien Credit Facility in accordance with its terms See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the issuance of the First Lien Notes and the termination of the First Lien Credit Facility The issuance of the First Lien Notes the refinancing of the First Lien Credit Facility revolver with the Corporate Revolving Facility in and the resulting termination of the First Lien Credit Facility provide us with significant benefits The termination of the First Lien Credit Facility eliminated the more restrictive of our debt covenants resulting in increased operational strategic and financial flexibility in managing our capital resources including the flexibility to reinvest more earnings for internal growth issue and or buyback shares of our common stock and incur additional debt if needed for acquisition or development Additionally we extended the remaining contractual debt maturities under the First Lien Credit Facility of approximately billion due in to Under the First Lien Notes and Corporate Revolving Facility subject in each case to the limitations contained therein and in the Collateral Agency and Intercreditor Agreement we may re invest future earnings internally for additional growth and or may elect to return cash to shareholders issue and or buyback additional shares of our common stock incur additional first lien indebtedness up to certain consolidated net tangible asset ratios incur additional subordinated or junior secured debt and use corporate resources to freely invest in our subsidiaries which are not first lien guarantors Additionally except as required under certain of our project debt we are no longer subject to an excess cash flow payment calculation or cash sweeps and we are no longer limited in the amount of capital expenditures for future growth Closing the Term Loan and the New Term Loan and Termination of the NDH Project Debt and Other Project Debt On March we closed on the billion Term Loan and we used the proceeds received together with operating cash on hand to fully retire the approximately billion NDH Project Debt in accordance with its repayment terms The NDH Project Debt was originally established to partially fund the Conectiv Acquisition On June we repaid approximately million of project debt with the proceeds received from million in borrowings under the New Term Loan The Term Loan and the New Term Loan refinancings reduce our overall cost of debt and simplifies our capital structure by bringing debt up to the corporate level from the subsidiary level eliminating the need for subsidiary level reporting and the potential for cash to be temporarily trapped at the subsidiary level Additionally these transactions demonstrate our continued ability to strategically access capital markets The Term Loan and the New Term Loan contain very similar covenants qualifications exceptions and limitations as the First Lien Notes Russell City Project Debt On June we through our indirect partially owned subsidiary Russell City Energy Company LLC closed on our approximately million Russell City Project Debt to finance construction of Russell City a MW natural gas fired combined cycle power plant under construction located in Hayward California which is comprised of a million construction loan facility an approximately million project letter of credit facility and a million debt service reserve letter of credit facility The construction loan converts to a ten year term loan when commercial operations commence Borrowings bear interest initially at LIBOR plus At December approximately million had been drawn under the construction loan and approximately million of letters of credit were issued under the letter of credit facilities Calpine s pro rata share would be and the pro rata share related to the noncontrolling interest would be Los Esteros Project Debt On August we through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility LLC closed on our million Los Esteros Project Debt to finance the upgrade of our Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility from a MW simple cycle power plant to a MW combined cycle generation power plant The upgrade will also increase the efficiency and environmental performance of the power plant by lowering the Heat Rate The Los Esteros Project Debt is comprised of a million construction loan facility an approximately million project letter of credit facility and an approximately million debt service reserve letter of credit facility The construction loan converts to a ten year term loan when commercial operations commence Borrowings bear interest initially at LIBOR plus At December approximately million had been drawn under the construction loan and approximately million of letters of credit were issued under the letter of credit facilities See also Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our First Lien Notes Term Loan New Term Loan Russell City Project Debt and Los Esteros Project Debt Share Repurchase Program On August we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock The announced share repurchase program did not specify an expiration date The repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice Through the filing of this Report a total of shares of our outstanding common stock have been repurchased under this program for approximately million at an average price paid of per share The shares repurchased as of the date of this Report were purchased in open market transactions Riverside Energy Center Purchase Option As disclosed in Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements Riverside Energy Center has a PPA that provides a third party a fixed price option to purchase the power plant which is exercisable in The third party has publicly stated their intent to exercise this purchase option As a result we expect to receive approximately million during the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of Riverside Energy Center CDHI On January we amended our letter of credit facility related to CDHI to increase the facility from million to million and extend the maturity from December to January Construction Upgrades and Growth Initiatives We remain focused on our goal to continue to grow our presence in core markets with an emphasis on expansions or upgrades of existing power plants We intend to take advantage of favorable opportunities to continue to design develop acquire construct and operate the next generation of highly efficient operationally flexible and environmentally responsible power plants where such investment meets our rigorous financial hurdles particularly if power contracts and financing are available and attractive returns are expected Likewise we will actively seek divestiture opportunities on our non core assets if those opportunities meet our financial expectations In addition we believe that upgrades and expansions to our current assets or using existing equipment offer proven and financially disciplined opportunities to improve our operations capacity and efficiencies Our significant projects under construction growth initiatives and upgrades are discussed below York Energy Center We acquired the York Energy Center a MW dual fuel combined cycle power plant under construction as part of the Conectiv Acquisition York Energy Center achieved COD on March three months early and sells power under a six year PPA with a third party which commenced on June PJM Given our view of the potential need for new generation in the PJM region driven both by market growth and the expected impacts of environmental regulations on older less efficient generation within the region we view the PJM region as a market with an attractive growth profile In order to capitalize on this outlook we are actively pursuing a set of development options including projects at Garrison Delaware Actively permitting MW of new combined cycle capacity at a development site secured by a lease option with the City of Dover PJM s system impact study for the first phase MW and the feasibility study for the second phase MW have been completed Both studies are being reviewed internally Environmental permitting site development planning and development engineering are underway Edge Moor Delaware A nominal MW combined cycle development project located at our Edge Moor facility which will leverage existing infrastructure PJM is currently conducting a system impact study which will provide a detailed report on the project s interconnection costs Russell City Energy Center The Russell City Energy Center is under construction and continues to move forward with expected COD in Upon completion this project will bring on line approximately MW of net interest baseload capacity MW with peaking capacity representing our share We are in possession of all required approvals and permits and we closed on construction financing on June The project s prevention of significant deterioration permit is currently the subject of an ongoing appeal at the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit brought by Chabot Las Positas Community College District against the EPA Upon completion the Russell City Energy Center is contracted to deliver its full output to PG E under a ten year PPA Los Esteros During we and PG E negotiated a new PPA to replace the existing California Department of Water Resources contract and facilitate the upgrade of our Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility from a MW simple cycle generation power plant to a MW combined cycle generation power plant which will also increase the efficiency and environmental performance of the power plant by lowering the Heat Rate The ten year PPA and related agreements with PG E have received all of the necessary approvals and licenses which are now effective The California Energy Commission has renewed our license and emission limits which is final The Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued its renewal of the Authority to Construct We began construction in the second quarter of and obtained construction financing on August We expect COD in Geysers Assets Expansion We continue to look to expand our production from our Geysers Assets Beginning in the fourth quarter of we conducted an exploratory drilling program which effectively proved the commercial viability of the steam field in the northern part of our Geysers Assets We have received Conditional Use Permits from Sonoma County and are pursuing the additional required permitting We are pursuing commercial arrangements which will need to be in place prior to commencing expansion activities We continue to believe our northern Geysers Assets have potential for development In the meantime we have connected certain test wells to our existing power plants to capture incremental production from those wells while continuing with the permitting process baseline engineering work and sales efforts for an expansion ERCOT Channel and Deer Park Expansions We continue to evaluate the ERCOT market for expansion opportunities based on tightening reserve margins and potential impact of EPA regulations on generation in Texas At both our Deer Park and Channel Energy Centers we have the ability to install an additional combustion turbine generator and connect to the existing steam turbine generator to expand the capacity of these facilities and to improve the overall efficiency In September we filed an air permit application with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ and the EPA to expand the Deer Park Energy Center by approximately MW In November we filed similar permits with the TCEQ and the EPA to expand the Channel Energy Center by approximately MW Mankato Power Plant Expansion Proposal In March Xcel Energy Inc Xcel filed an application with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission MPUC to construct a new MW natural gas fired combined cycle facility to be located at its existing Black Dog site The MPUC required Xcel to also seek potential third party alternatives so that MPUC could compare any offers to Xcel s proposal We proposed to expand our Mankato power plant a MW natural gas fired combined cycle power plant by MW under a PPA with Xcel We believe that our proposal is less expensive environmentally preferable and a closer match to Xcel s demand forecast than its self build proposal The matter was referred to a contested case hearing Xcel subsequently filed to withdraw its application for the Black Dog expansion which may affect the status of our proposed Mankato expansion Xcel s request is currently pending review by an administrative law judge A decision is not expected until the second quarter of Turbine Upgrades We continue to move forward with our turbine upgrade program Through December we have completed the upgrade of ten Siemens and five GE turbines and have agreed to upgrade approximately six additional Siemens and GE turbines and may upgrade additional turbines in the future Our turbine upgrade program is expected to increase our generation capacity in total by approximately MW This upgrade program began in the fourth quarter of and is scheduled through The upgraded turbines have been operating with Heat Rates consistent with expectations Major Maintenance and Capital Spending Our major maintenance and capital spending remains an important part of our business Our expected expenditures for are as follows in millions Major maintenance expense Capital expenditures operations net of expected grants Growth related capital expenditures Total major maintenance expense and capital spending Less Amounts expected to be funded with financing Net major maintenance expense and capital spending __________ Consist of amounts to be drawn under our Russell City Project Debt and Los Esteros Project Debt NOLs We have significant NOLs that will provide future tax deductions when we generate sufficient taxable income during the applicable carryover periods As discussed in Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements we elected to consolidate our CCFC and Calpine groups for federal income tax reporting purposes during the first quarter of As a result of the consolidation we will be able to utilize approximately million additional Calpine group NOLs against CCFC group deferred tax liabilities At December our consolidated federal NOLs totaled approximately billion See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our NOLs As a result of the settlement with holders of the CalGen Third Lien Debt and the final distribution to the holders of allowed unsecured claims in accordance with our Plan of Reorganization in we recognized approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes respectively in cancellation of debt income related to this distribution Cash Flow Activities The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended December and in millions Beginning cash and cash equivalents Net cash provided by used in Operating activities Investing activities Financing activities Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents Ending cash and cash equivalents Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December was million compared to million for the year ended December The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to Working capital Working capital employed increased by approximately million for the year ended December compared to after adjusting for debt related balances and non hedging interest rate swaps which did not impact cash provided by operating activities The increase was primarily due to a reduction in margin requirements during the year ended December Interest paid Cash paid for interest inclusive of interest rate swaps in hedging relationships increased by million to million for the year ended December as compared to million for The increase was primarily due to timing of interest payments on the issuance of First Lien Notes Term Loan and New Term Loan as compared to the previously outstanding First Lien Credit Facility and project debt Prepayment Premiums For the year ended December we paid million of prepayment premiums related to the extinguishment of the NDH Project Debt Our decrease in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by the following Income from operations adjusted for non cash items increased by million for the year ended December as compared to Non cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization gains and losses on sales of assets impairment losses income and losses from unconsolidated investments and unrealized gains and losses in mark to market activity Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December were million compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended December The difference was primarily due to Purchase of Conectiv assets and BRSP We purchased the Conectiv assets and BRSP for approximately billion in There were no acquisitions in Capital expenditures Capital expenditures increased by million primarily resulting from construction activity at the Russell City Energy Center Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility and York Energy Center combined with our turbine upgrade program Lower proceeds from sales of power plants interests and other In the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately million from the disposal of other plant assets compared to proceeds of approximately million primarily relating to the sale of Blue Spruce Rocky Mountain and a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant in the year ended December Settlement of non hedging interest rate swaps During the year ended December we made payments on interest rate swap derivative instruments associated with swaps that formerly hedged variable rate debt which was converted to fixed rate debt of million compared to payments of million during the same period in Restricted cash The net decrease in restricted cash was million for the year ended December compared to million for the same period in The decrease in restricted cash in as compared to was primarily due to the maturity of project debt and the corresponding reduction in restricted cash requirements Transmission credits During the year ended December we paid million for transmission credits related to construction of our Russell City Energy Center Net Cash Provided By Used In Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities were million in the year ended December compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million for the year ended December The change in cash flows provided by used in financing activities was primarily related to Issuance of the Term Loan and New Term Loan During the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately billion from the issuance of the Term Loan and New Term Loan We used the proceeds to repay our NDH Project Debt of approximately billion resulting in a net increase of million Issuance of the First Lien Notes We received proceeds of approximately billion from the issuance of the First Lien Notes and used those proceeds to terminate the First Lien Credit Facility in accordance with its repayment terms resulting in a net increase of million during the year ended December compared to a net increase of million during the year ended December Reduced proceeds from project debt During the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately million related to our Russell City Project Debt and Los Esteros Project Debt During we received proceeds of approximately billion to fund the Conectiv acquisition Lower Repayments of Project Debt During the year ended December we made repayments on project debt of approximately million compared to approximately million in the year ended December Increased Contributions from noncontrolling interest holder During the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately million from a noncontrolling interest holder in Russell City Energy Center compared to contributions of approximately million in the year ended December Decreased Finance Costs During the year ended December primarily due to the refinancing of the First Lien Credit Facility and the NDH Project Debt we incurred million in finance costs primarily related to the issuance of the First Lien Notes and project debt compared to million in finance costs primarily related to the issuance of the First Lien Notes and project debt Stock Repurchases During the year ended December we made payments of approximately million under the share repurchase program announced on August There were no similar repurchases during the same period in Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December improved to million compared to million for the year ended December Our improvement in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to Working capital Working capital employed after adjusting for debt related balances and derivative activities which did not impact cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million for the year ended December compared to The decrease was primarily due to reduced Commodity Margin requirements Interest paid Cash paid for interest inclusive of interest rate swaps in hedging relationships decreased by million to million for the year ended December as compared to million for primarily due to the timing of interest payments and the replacement of the First Lien Credit Facility with First Lien Notes at lower fixed interest rates Our improvements in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by the following Income from operations adjusted for non cash items decreased by million for the year ended December as compared to Non cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization gains and losses on sales of assets impairment losses income and losses from unconsolidated investments and unrealized gains and losses in mark to market activity Cash taxes Net cash paid for taxes in was approximately million compared to net cash received for taxes of approximately million in In we received refunds from foreign tax jurisdictions with no such refunds in Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December were million compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended December The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to Purchase of Conectiv assets and BRSP We purchased the Conectiv assets and BRSP for approximately billion in There were no acquisitions in Capital expenditures Capital expenditures increased by million primarily resulting from construction activity at our York Energy Center and Russell City Energy Center combined with our Geysers Assets expansion activities Settlement of non hedging interest rate swaps In the year ended December we paid million on interest rate swap losses associated with swaps that formerly hedged the variable rate debt which was converted to fixed rate debt in the year We made no similar payments in The increase in cash flows used in investing activities was partially offset by Decrease in restricted cash Restricted cash decreased million in compared to a million increase in The decrease was primarily due to releases of restrictions on cash resulting from the repayment of project debt Sales of power plants interests and other We received proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our ownership interests in Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain combined with the sale of a undivided interest in the assets of our Freestone power plant We had no significant asset sales in Net Cash Provided By Used In Financing Activities Cash flows provided by financing activities increased approximately billion to million for the year ended December compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately billion for the comparable period in The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily related to Issuance of the First Lien Notes In the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately billion from the issuance of First Lien Notes We used these proceeds to make repayments on the First Lien Credit Facility of approximately billion resulting in a net increase of million Lower Repayments on the First Lien Credit Facility In the year ended December we made regularly scheduled payments on the First Lien Credit Facility of approximately million a decrease of million compared to payments of million for the year ended December Additionally in the year ended December we repaid million on our First Lien Credit Facility revolver Increase in Project Debt In the year ended December we received proceeds of approximately billion from project debt used to finance the Conectiv Acquisition a million increase compared to project debt issued in the year ended December which was primarily due to the refinancing of CCFC Lower Repayments of Project Debt In the year ended December we made repayments on project debt of approximately million a decrease of million compared to the prior year The decrease is primarily due to the repayment of approximately million related to the Blue Spruce and Rocky Mountain transaction in compared to approximately billion of repayments related to the CCFC Refinancing in Additionally we made higher payments of approximately million on other project debt in the year ended December Increased Finance Costs The increase in cash flows provided by financing activities was partially offset by an increase in finance costs of million In the year ended December we incurred million in finance costs primarily related to the issuance of the First Lien Notes and project debt compared to million incurred in to facilitate an amendment to the First Lien Credit Facility and to refinance other project debt Counterparties and Customers Our counterparties primarily consist of three categories of entities who participate in the wholesale energy markets financial institutions and trading companies regulated utilities municipalities cooperatives ISOs and other retail power suppliers and oil natural gas chemical and other energy related industrial companies We have exposure to trends within the energy industry including declines in the creditworthiness of our marketing counterparties We have concentrations of credit risk with a few of our commercial customers relating to our sales of power steam and hedging and optimization activities Currently certain of our marketing counterparties within the energy industry have below investment grade credit ratings We believe that our credit policies and portfolio of transactions adequately monitor and diversify our credit risk and currently our counterparties are performing and financially settling timely according to their respective agreements We also have unfunded credit exposure to several financial institutions domiciled in European countries that are currently experiencing stressed economic and financial conditions related to our Russell City Project Debt Los Esteros Project Debt miscellaneous project finance letter of credit facilities and interest rate derivative contracts These financial institutions continue to perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements Should one or all of these financial institutions be unable to perform under their obligations it would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations The table below sets forth our unfunded exposure for these financial institutions by country of domicile as of December in millions Country of Domicile December France Spain Germany Italy Total unfunded exposure Credit Considerations Our credit rating has among other things generally required us to post significant collateral with our hedging counterparties Our collateral is generally in the form of cash deposits letters of credit or first liens on our assets See also Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our use of collateral Our credit rating has also reduced the number of hedging counterparties willing to extend credit to us and reduced our ability to negotiate more favorable terms with them However we believe that we will continue to be able to work with our hedging counterparties to execute beneficial hedging transactions and provide adequate collateral On September Standard and Poor s Ratings Services upgraded our corporate credit rating to B from B and upgraded the secured credit rating of our First Lien Notes Term Loan New Term Loan and Corporate Revolving Facility to BB from B both with stable outlooks According to Standard and Poor s credit opinion the ratings upgrades resulted from our Conectiv Acquisition recent market trends that benefit our natural gas fired power plants such as low natural gas prices and recent EPA regulations recent corporate refinancing transactions which extended our debt maturities and our ability to generate positive cash flow from our operations At December our First Lien Notes Term Loan New Term Loan Corporate Revolving Facility and our corporate rating had the following ratings and commentary from Standard and Poor s and Moody s Investors Service Standard and Poor s Moody s Investors Service First Lien Notes Term Loan New Term Loan and Corporate Revolving Facility rating BB B Corporate rating B B Commentary Stable Stable Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Some of our power plant operating leases include certain sale leaseback transactions that are not reflected on our balance sheet All counterparties in these transactions are third parties that are unrelated to us The sale leaseback transactions utilize special purpose entities formed by the equity investors with the sole purpose of owning a power plant Some of these operating leases contain customary restrictions on dividends up to Calpine Corporation additional debt and further encumbrances similar to those typically found in project finance debt instruments We have no ownership or other interest in any of these special purpose entities See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the future minimum lease payments under our power plant operating leases Some of our unconsolidated equity method investments have debt that is not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets As of December our equity method

Consolidated Balance Sheets These amounts may differ materially from the assets and liabilities for these entities that present individual financial statements on a stand alone basis to their project lenders GEC a wholly owned subsidiary of GEC Holdings LLC has been established as an entity with its existence separate from us and other subsidiaries of ours On September GEC completed an offering of million of senior secured notes due In connection with the issuance of the secured notes we received funding on a third party preferred equity investment in GEC Holdings LLC totaling million This preferred interest met the criteria of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument that was classified as debt due to certain preferential distributions to the third party In the third quarter of the GEC senior secured notes and the debt related to the GEC Holdings LLC mandatorily redeemable financial instrument were fully repaid On December we executed purchase agreements to purchase two of the third party equity interests in GEC Holdings LLC The closing of these transactions are subject to FERC approval and the terms of the agreements The following table sets forth selected financial information of GEC at December in millions Assets Liabilities RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMMODITY ACCOUNTING Our hedging strategy and our commercial efforts attempt to maximize our risk adjusted Commodity Margin by leveraging our knowledge experience and fundamental views on gas and power We actively seek to manage the commodity risks of our portfolio utilizing multiple strategies of buying and selling power natural gas and Heat Rate contracts to manage our Spark Spread and products that manage geographic price differences basis differential We have approximately MW of capacity from power plants where we purchase fuel oil to meet our generation requirements if required however we have not currently entered into any hedging or optimization transactions for our fuel oil requirements as we do not expect fuel oil requirements to be material to us but may elect to do so in the future Along with our portfolio of hedging transactions we enter into power and natural gas positions that often act as hedges to our asset portfolio but do not qualify for or we elect not to designate as hedges under hedge accounting guidelines such as commodity options transactions and instruments that settle on power price to natural gas price relationships Heat Rate swaps and options or instruments that settle on power price relationships between delivery points While our selling and purchasing of power and natural gas is mostly physical in nature we also engage in marketing hedging and optimization activities particularly in natural gas that are financial in nature We use derivative instruments which include physical commodity contracts and financial commodity instruments such as OTC and exchange traded swaps futures options forward agreements and instruments that settle on the power price to natural gas price relationships Heat Rate swaps and options for the purchase and sale of power natural gas and emission allowances to manage commodity price risk and to maximize the risk adjusted returns from our power and natural gas assets We conduct these hedging and optimization activities within a structured risk management framework based on controls policies and procedures We monitor these activities through active and ongoing management and oversight defined roles and responsibilities and daily risk measurement and reporting Additionally we seek to manage the associated risks through diversification by controlling position sizes by using portfolio position limits and by entering into offsetting positions that lock in a margin We also are exposed to commodity price movements both profits and losses in connection with these transactions These positions are included in and subject to our consolidated risk management portfolio position limits and controls structure Changes in fair value of commodity positions that do not qualify for or we do not elect either hedge accounting or the normal purchase normal sale exemption are recognized currently in earnings within operating revenues in the case of power transactions and within fuel and purchased energy expense in the case of natural gas transactions Our future hedged status and marketing and optimization activities are subject to change as determined by our commercial operations group Chief Risk Officer Risk Management Committee of senior management and Board of Directors We have economically hedged a portion of our expected generation and natural gas portfolio mostly through power and natural gas forward physical and financial transactions however we remain susceptible to significant price movements for and beyond By entering into these transactions we are able to economically hedge a portion of our Spark Spread at pre determined generation and price levels We use a combination of PPAs and other hedging instruments to manage our variability in future cash flows At December the maximum length of time that our PPAs extended was approximately years into the future and the maximum length of time over which we were hedging using commodity and interest rate derivative instruments was and years respectively We have historically used interest rate swaps to adjust the mix between our fixed and variable rate debt To the extent eligible our interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges and changes in fair value are recorded in OCI to the extent they are effective with gains and losses reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings The reclassification of unrealized losses from AOCI into income and the changes in fair value and settlements subsequent to the reclassification date of the interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility is presented separately from interest expense as loss on interest rate derivatives on our Consolidated Statements of Operations On January we repaid the remaining balance under the First Lien Credit Facility term loans with the proceeds received from the issuance of the First Lien Notes and the unrealized losses related to these interest rate swaps of approximately million remaining in AOCI were reclassified out of AOCI and into income as additional loss on interest rate derivatives during In addition we reclassified approximately million in unrealized losses in AOCI to loss on interest rate derivatives during resulting from the repayment of project debt in During we reclassified approximately million out of AOCI and into income as additional loss on interest rate derivatives related to interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans Assuming constant December power and natural gas prices and interest rates we estimate that pre tax net gains of million would be reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the next months as the hedged transactions settle however the actual amounts that will be reclassified will vary based on changes in natural gas and power prices as well as interest rates Therefore we are unable to predict what the actual reclassification from AOCI into earnings positive or negative will be for the next months The primary factors affecting our market risk and the fair value of our derivatives at any point in time are the volume of open derivative positions MMBtu MWh and notional amounts changing commodity market prices principally for power and natural gas our credit standing and that of our counterparties for energy commodity derivatives and prevailing interest rates for our interest rate swaps Since prices for power and natural gas and interest rates are volatile there may be material changes in the fair value of our derivatives over time driven both by price volatility and the changes in volume of open derivative transactions Our derivative assets have increased to approximately billion at December compared to billion at December and our derivative liabilities have increased to approximately billion at December compared to billion at December At December the fair value of our level derivative assets and liabilities represent only a small portion of our total assets and liabilities less than See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our level derivative assets and liabilities The change in fair value of our outstanding commodity and interest rate derivative instruments from January through December is summarized in the table below in millions Interest Rate Swaps Commodity Instruments Total Fair value of contracts outstanding at January Items recognized or otherwise settled during the period Fair value attributable to new contracts Changes in fair value attributable to price movements Changes in fair value attributable to nonperformance risk Fair value of contracts outstanding at December __________ Interest rate settlements consist of recognized losses from former interest rate cash flow hedges of million that were de designated as a result of the repayment of project debt in million related to recognition of losses from settlements of designated cash flow hedges and million in losses from settlements of undesignated interest rate swaps represents a portion of interest expense and loss on interest rate derivatives as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations Gains on settlement of commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments of million represents a portion of operating revenues and fuel and purchased energy expense as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and million related to recognition of gains from cash flow hedges previously reflected in OCI partially offset by other changes in derivative assets and liabilities not reflected in OCI or net income Net commodity and interest rate derivative assets and liabilities reported in Notes and of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The change since the last balance sheet date in the total value of the derivatives both assets and liabilities is reflected either in cash for option premiums paid or collected in OCI net of tax for cash flow hedges or on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component gain or loss in current earnings The following tables detail the components of our total mark to market activity for both the net realized gain loss and the net unrealized gain loss recognized from our derivative instruments in earnings and where these components were recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December and in millions Realized gain loss Interest rate swaps Commodity derivative instruments Total realized gain loss Unrealized gain loss Interest rate swaps Commodity derivative instruments Total unrealized gain loss Total mark to market activity net ____________ In addition to changes in market value on derivatives not designated as hedges changes in unrealized gain loss also includes de designation of interest rate swap cash flow hedges and related reclassification from AOCI into income hedge ineffectiveness and adjustments to reflect changes in credit default risk exposure Realized and unrealized gain loss Power contracts included in operating revenues Natural gas contracts included in fuel and purchased energy expense Interest rate swaps included in interest expense Loss on interest rate derivatives Total mark to market activity net Our change in AOCI from an accumulated loss of million at December to an accumulated loss of million at December was primarily driven by a decrease in longer term LIBOR rates which negatively impacted our project debt interest rate swaps by million inclusive of intraperiod losses throughout on project debt interest rate swaps settling in and million associated with gains on settlement of commodity derivative cash flow hedges reclassified into net income inclusive of the unfavorable impact from reclassification into net income of intraperiod gains throughout on commodity derivative cash flow hedges settling in These negative factors were partially offset by million in losses on settlement of interest rate swap cash flow hedges reclassified into net income inclusive of the favorable impact from reclassification into net income of intraperiod losses throughout on project debt interest rate swaps settling in a reclassification adjustment of million for cash flow hedges formerly hedging the First Lien Credit Facility term loans realized in net income gains of million on existing commodity derivative cash flow hedges inclusive of intraperiod gains throughout on commodity derivative cash flow hedges settling in and the effect of income taxes which includes a net million increase to tax benefit in OCI with a partial offsetting expense to continuing operations related to the intraperiod tax allocation provisions under U S GAAP Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risks result from exposure to changes in spot prices forward prices price volatilities and correlations between the price of power steam and natural gas We manage the commodity price risk and the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of power and purchases of natural gas of our entire portfolio of generating assets and contractual positions by entering into various derivative and non derivative instruments The net fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments at December based on price source and the period during which the instruments will mature are summarized in the table below in millions Fair Value Source After Total Prices actively quoted Prices provided by other external sources Prices based on models and other valuation methods Total fair value We measure the energy commodity price risks in our portfolio on a daily basis using a VAR model to estimate the maximum potential one day risk of loss based upon historical experience resulting from market movements in comparison to internally established thresholds Our VAR is calculated for our entire portfolio which is comprised of energy commodity derivatives power plants PPAs and other physical and financial transactions The portfolio VAR calculation incorporates positions for the remaining portion of the current calendar year exclusive of the current month of measurement plus the following two calendar years We measure VAR using a variance covariance approach based on a confidence level of a one day holding period and actual observed historical correlation While we believe that our VAR assumptions and approximations are reasonable different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different estimates The table below presents the high low and average of our daily VAR for the years ended December and in millions Year ended December High Low Average As of December Due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as VAR the VAR calculation may not capture the full extent of our commodity price exposure As a result actual changes in the value of our energy commodity portfolio could be different from the calculated VAR and the actual changes could have a material impact on our financial results In order to evaluate the risks of our portfolio on a comprehensive basis and augment our VAR analysis we also measure the risk of the energy commodity portfolio using several analytical methods including sensitivity tests scenario tests stress tests and daily position reports Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises from the general funding requirements needed to manage our activities and assets and liabilities Increasing natural gas prices or Market Heat Rates can cause increased collateral requirements Our liquidity management framework is intended to maximize liquidity access and minimize funding costs during times of rising prices See further discussion regarding our uses of collateral as they relate to our commodity procurement and risk management activities in Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Credit Risk Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from nonperformance or non payment by our counterparties related to their contractual obligations with us Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows We also have credit risk if counterparties are unable to provide collateral or post margin We monitor and manage our credit risk through credit policies that include credit approvals routine monitoring of counterparties credit limits and their overall credit ratings limiting our marketing hedging and optimization activities with high risk counterparties margin collateral or prepayment arrangements and payment netting arrangements or master netting arrangements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty We have concentrations of credit risk with a few of our commercial customers relating to our sales of power steam and hedging and optimization activities We believe that our credit policies and portfolio of transactions adequately monitor and diversify our credit risk and currently our counterparties are performing and financially settling timely according to their respective agreements We monitor and manage our total comprehensive credit risk associated with all of our contracts and PPAs irrespective of whether they are accounted for as an executory contract a normal purchase normal sale or whether they are marked to market and included in our derivative assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets Our counterparty credit quality associated with the net fair value of outstanding derivative commodity instruments is included in our derivative assets and liabilities at December and the period during which the instruments will mature are summarized in the table below in millions Credit Quality Based on Standard Poor s Ratings as of December After Total Investment grade Non investment grade No external ratings Total fair value Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable rate debt Interest rate risk represents the potential loss in earnings arising from adverse changes in market interest rates Our variable rate financings are indexed to base rates generally LIBOR The following table summarizes the contract terms as well as the fair values of our debt instruments exposed to interest rate risk as of December All outstanding balances and fair market values are shown gross of applicable premium or discount if any in millions Thereafter Total Fair Value December Debt by Maturity Date Fixed Rate Average Interest Rate Variable Rate Average Interest Rate ____________ Projection based upon anticipated LIBOR rates Our variable rate financings are indexed to base rates generally LIBOR Interest rate risk represents the potential loss in earnings arising from adverse changes in market interest rates The fair value of our interest rate swaps are validated based upon external quotes Our interest rate swaps are with counterparties we believe are primarily high quality institutions and we do not believe that our interest rate swaps expose us to any significant credit risk Holding all other factors constant we estimate that a decrease in interest rates would result in a change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility of approximately million and would result in a change in the fair value of our interest rate swaps hedging our other variable rate debt of approximately million at December APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U S GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved We believe the following are our more critical accounting policies due to the significance subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies We evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience anticipated future events or trends consultation with third party advisors or other methods that involve judgment as determined appropriate under the circumstances The resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known Revenue Recognition We routinely enter into physical commodity contracts for sales of our generated power to manage risk and capture the value inherent in our generation Determining the proper accounting for our power contracts can require significant judgment and impact how we recognize revenue In addition we determine whether the contract should be accounted for on a gross or net basis Determining the proper accounting treatment involves the evaluation of quantitative as well as qualitative factors to determine if the contract should be accounted for as one of the following a contract that qualifies as a lease a derivative a contract that meets the definition of a derivative but is eligible for the normal purchase normal sale exemption or a contract that is a physical or executory contract Lease Accounting Revenue from contracts accounted for as operating leases such as certain tolling agreements with minimum lease rentals which vary over time must be levelized Generally we levelize these contract revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the contract Executory and Physical Contracts Exempt from Derivative Accounting We generally recognize revenue from the sale of power or host steam thermal energy for sale to our customers for use in industrial or other heating operations upon transmission and delivery to the customer at the contractual price In addition to revenues from power host steam revenues and RECs from our Geysers Assets related to generation our operating revenues also include power and steam revenue consisting of fixed and variable capacity payments including capacity payments received from PJM capacity auctions which are not related to generation other revenues such as RMR Contracts resource adequacy and certain ancillary service revenues and other service revenues Capacity payments RMR Contracts RECs resource adequacy and other ancillary revenues are recognized when contractually earned and consist of revenues received from our customers either at the market price or a contract price See Accounting for Derivative Instruments directly below for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to accounting for derivative instruments We apply lease accounting to contracts that meet the definition of a lease and accrual accounting treatment to those contracts that are either exempt from derivative accounting or do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument Gross vs Net Accounting We determine whether the financial statement presentation of revenues should be on a gross or net basis Where we act as principal we record settlement of our physical commodity contracts on a gross basis With respect to our physical executory contracts where we do not take title to the commodities but receive a variable payment to convert natural gas into power and steam in a tolling operation we record revenues on a net basis Our physical commodity contracts are not entered into for the purpose of settling on a net basis with another counterparty Fair Value Measurements We use fair value to measure certain of our assets liabilities and expenses in our financial statements Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date i e the exit price Generally the determination of fair value requires the use of significant judgment and different approaches and models under varying circumstances Under a market based approach we consider prices of similar assets consult with brokers and experts or employ other valuation techniques Under an income based approach we generally estimate future cash flows and then discount them at a risk adjusted rate Accordingly the determination of fair value represents a critical accounting policy Our most significant fair value measurements represent the valuation of our derivative assets and liabilities which are measured on a recurring basis each reporting period and measurements of impairments and acquired assets on a nonrecurring basis We primarily apply the market approach and income approach for recurring fair value measurements primarily our derivative assets and liabilities using the best available information We primarily utilize the income approach for nonrecurring fair value measurements such as impairments of our assets as market prices for similar assets may not be readily available and may not incorporate the expected future returns from our assets We utilize valuation techniques that seek to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs We classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs U S GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which classifies fair value measurements from level through level based upon the inputs used to measure fair value Level Quoted prices unadjusted are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis Level Pricing inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument Level Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable or from unobservable sources These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value Derivative Instruments and Valuation Techniques The primary factors affecting the fair value of our derivative instruments at any point in time are the volume of open derivative positions MMBtu MWh and notional amounts market price levels primarily for power and natural gas our credit standing and that of our counterparties and prevailing interest rates for our interest rate swaps Prices for power and natural gas and interest rates are volatile which can result in material changes in the fair value measurements reported in our financial statements in the future Derivative contracts can be exchange traded or OTC For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment Certain OTC derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult For our level and level derivative instruments we utilize models to measure fair value Where models are used the selection of a particular model to value an asset or liability depends upon the contractual terms and specific risks as well as the availability of pricing information in the market We generally use similar models to value similar instruments Valuation models require a variety of inputs including contractual terms market prices yield curves credit curves and measures of volatility These models are primarily industry standard models including the Black Scholes option pricing model Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace In cases where there is no corroborating market information available to support significant model inputs we initially use the transaction price as the best estimate of fair value Our derivative instruments that are traded on the NYMEX primarily consist of natural gas swaps futures and options and are classified as level fair value measurements Our derivative instruments that primarily consist of interest rate swaps and OTC power and natural gas forwards for which market based pricing inputs are observable are classified as level fair value measurements Generally we obtain our level pricing inputs from market sources such as the Intercontinental Exchange and Bloomberg Our OTC power and natural gas forwards and options where pricing inputs are unobservable as well as other complex and structured transactions are classified as level fair value measurements Complex or structured transactions are tailored to our or our customers needs and can introduce the need for internally developed model inputs which might not be observable in or corroborated by the market When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value the instrument is categorized in level At each balance sheet date we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value measurement and include in level all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs The determination of fair value of our derivatives also includes consideration of our credit standing the credit standing of our counterparties and the impact of credit enhancements if any We assess non performance risk by adjusting the fair value of our derivatives based on our credit standing or the credit standing of our counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements if any Such valuation adjustments represent the amount of probable loss due to default either by us or a third party Our credit valuation methodology is based on a quantitative approach which allocates a credit adjustment to the fair value of derivative transactions based on the net exposure of each counterparty We develop our credit reserve based on our expectation of the market participants perspective of potential credit exposure Our calculation of the credit reserve on net asset positions is based on available market information including credit default swap rates credit ratings and historical default information We also incorporate non performance risk in net liability positions based on an assessment of our potential risk of default Impairments When we determine an impairment exists we determine fair value using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows In order to estimate future cash flows we consider historical cash flows existing and future contracts and PPAs and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows To the extent applicable the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example in preparing our other earnings forecasts Our forecasts generally assume that Commodity Margin will increase in future years in these regions as the supply and demand relationships improve The use of this method involves inherent uncertainty We use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors including forward price curves for power and fuel costs and forecasted operating costs However actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material We also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment including contract terms tenor and credit risk of counterparts We may also consider prices of similar assets consult with brokers or employ other valuation techniques We use our best estimates in making these evaluations however actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material Acquisitions of Assets and Liabilities U S GAAP requires that the purchase price for an acquisition such as our Conectiv Acquisition be assigned and allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based upon their fair value Generally the amount recorded in the financial statements for an acquisition is the purchase price value of the consideration paid but a purchase price that exceeds the fair value of the assets acquired will result in the recognition of goodwill In addition to the potential for the recognition of goodwill differing fair values will impact the allocations of the purchase price to the individual assets and liabilities and can impact the gross amount and classification of assets and liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and can impact the timing and the amount of depreciation expense recorded in any given period We utilize our best effort to make our determinations and review all information available including estimated future cash flows and prices of similar assets when making our best estimate We also may hire independent appraisers to help us make this determination as we deem appropriate under the circumstances Accounting for Derivative Instruments Significant judgment and estimates are used in the accounting for derivative assets and liabilities which include contract interpretation and assumptions used in forecasting future generation and market expectations Derivative instruments which qualify for and are designated under the normal purchase normal sale exemption are not recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements until the physical transaction is settled Derivative instruments which do not qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption are recorded at fair value as discussed above in Fair Value Measurements Dependent upon whether a derivative instrument qualifies for and whether we elect or do not elect hedge accounting treatment can significantly impact the timing and classification of changes in fair value within our Consolidated Financial Statements as further discussed below Hedge Accounting Revenues and expenses derived from derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in the period and same financial statement line item as the hedged item Hedge accounting requires us to formally document designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting We present the cash flows from hedging derivatives in the same category as the item being hedged within operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows unless they contain an other than insignificant financing element in which case their cash flows are classified within financing activities Cash Flow Hedges We report the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of OCI and reclassify such gains and losses into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings Gains and losses due to ineffectiveness on commodity hedging instruments are included in unrealized mark to market gains and losses and are recognized currently in earnings as a component of operating revenues for power contracts and swaps fuel and purchased energy expense for natural gas contracts and swaps and interest expense for interest rate swaps except as discussed below If it is determined that the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively and future changes in fair value are recorded in earnings If the hedging instrument is terminated or de designated prior to the occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction the net accumulated gain or loss associated with the changes in fair value of the hedge instrument remains deferred in AOCI until such time as the forecasted transaction impacts earnings or until it is determined that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Along with our portfolio of transactions which are accounted for as hedges under U S GAAP we enter into power natural gas and interest rate transactions that primarily act as economic hedges to our asset and interest rate portfolio but either do not qualify as hedges under hedge accounting guidelines or qualify under the hedge accounting guidelines and the hedge accounting designation has not been elected Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized currently in earnings as a component of operating revenues for power contracts and Heat Rate swaps and options fuel and purchased energy expense for natural gas contracts swaps and options and interest expense for interest rate swaps except as discussed below During we repaid approximately billion of our First Lien Credit Facility term loans which had approximately billion notional amount of interest rate swaps hedging the scheduled variable interest payments and in January we repaid the remaining approximately billion of First Lien Credit Facility term loans which had approximately billion notional amount of interest rate swaps hedging the scheduled variable interest payments With the repayment of the remaining First Lien Credit Facility term loans the remaining unrealized losses of approximately million in AOCI related to the interest rate swaps formerly hedging the First Lien Credit Facility were reclassified out of AOCI and into income as an additional loss on interest rate derivatives during In addition we reclassified approximately million in unrealized losses in AOCI to loss on interest rate derivatives during resulting from the repayment of project debt in During we reclassified approximately million out of AOCI and into income as additional loss on interest rate derivatives related to interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans We have presented the reclassification of unrealized losses from AOCI into income and the changes in fair value and settlements subsequent to the reclassification date of the interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility described above separate from interest expense as loss on interest rate derivatives on our Consolidated Statements of Operations We also have determined that based upon current market conditions and consistent with our Risk Management Policy liquidation of these interest rate swaps is not economically beneficial and additional future losses are limited Accordingly we have elected to retain and hold these interest rate swap positions at this time The interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans substantially mature in See Notes and of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments and our interest rate swaps formerly hedging our First Lien Credit Facility term loans Accounting for VIEs and Financial Statement Consolidation Criteria We consolidate all VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary and where we determine that we have both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE We have determined that we hold the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits in all of our VIEs where we hold the majority equity interest Therefore our determination of whether to consolidate is based upon which variable interest holder has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE the primary beneficiary Our analysis includes consideration of the following primary activities which we believe to have a significant impact on a power plant s financial performance operations and maintenance plant dispatch and fuel strategy as well as our ability to control or influence contracting and overall plant strategy Our approach to determining which entity holds the powers and rights is based on powers held as of the balance sheet date Contractual terms that may change the powers held in future periods such as a purchase or sale option are not considered in our analysis Based on our analysis we believe that we hold the power and rights to direct the most significant activities of all our majority owned VIEs Under our consolidation policy and under U S GAAP we also perform an ongoing reassessment each reporting period of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our VIEs and evaluate if an entity is a VIE and whether we are the primary beneficiary whenever any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk as a group lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance or when there are other changes in the powers held by individual variable interest holders Because we are required to perform ongoing reassessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary future changes in our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary could require us to consolidate our VIEs that are currently not consolidated or deconsolidate our VIEs that are currently consolidated based upon our reassessments in future periods Making these determinations can require the use of significant judgment to determine which variable interest holder has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE the primary beneficiary and can directly impact amounts reported on our Consolidated Financial Statements Noncontrolling Interest We own a interest in Russell City Energy Company LLC one of our VIEs which is also owned by a third party We fully consolidate this entity in our Consolidated Financial Statements and account for the third party ownership interest as a noncontrolling interest under U S GAAP Disclosure Requirements U S GAAP requires separate disclosure on the face of our Consolidated Balance Sheets of the significant assets of a consolidated VIE that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and the significant liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors or beneficial interest holders do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary In determining which assets of our VIEs met the separate disclosure criteria we determined this separate disclosure requirement is met where Calpine Corporation is substantially limited or prohibited from access to assets primarily cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and property plant and equipment and where there are agreements that prohibit the debt holders of the VIE from recourse to the general credit of Calpine Corporation In determining which liabilities of our VIEs met the separate disclosure criteria we reviewed all of our VIEs and determined this separate disclosure requirement was met where our VIEs had project financing that prohibits the VIE from providing guarantees on the debt of others and where the amounts were material to our financial statements Unconsolidated VIEs We have a partnership interest in Greenfield LP and in Whitby Greenfield LP and Whitby are also VIEs however we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of these entities and therefore do not consolidate them We account for these entities under the equity method of accounting and include our net equity interest in investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets During we were not the primary beneficiary of OMEC based upon the accounting guidance in and did not consolidate OMEC Our equity interest in the net income from OMEC for the year ended December and both Greenfield LP and Whitby for the years ended December and are recorded in income from unconsolidated investments in power plants As required by U S GAAP we consolidated OMEC effective January We hold a call option to purchase the Inland Empire Energy Center a MW natural gas fired power plant located in California which achieved COD on May from GE that may be exercised between years and after the start of commercial operation GE holds a put option whereby they can require us to purchase the power plant if certain plant performance criteria are met during year after the start of commercial operation We determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of the Inland Empire power plant and we do not consolidate it due to but not limited to the fact that GE directs the most significant activities of the power plant including operations and maintenance Long Lived Assets and Depreciation Expense Determination of the appropriate depreciation method proper useful lives and salvage values involves significant judgment estimates assumptions and historical experience Changes in our estimates and methods can result in a significant impact in the amounts and timing of when we recognize depreciation expense and therefore significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations from period to period Different depreciation methods can impact the timing and amount of depreciation expense affecting our results of operations and could result in different net book values of assets at a particular time during the useful life of the asset affecting our financial position Estimates of useful lives also significantly impact the timing and amounts of depreciation expense and include significant estimates If useful lives are too short then the asset is depreciated too quickly and depreciation expense is overstated Estimated useful lives can significantly decrease if routine maintenance or certain upgrades are not performed premature mechanical failure of the asset occurs significant increases in the planned level of usage occur advances in technology make the asset obsolete or if there are adverse changes in environmental regulations Our depreciable cost basis of our assets are reduced by their estimated salvage values Estimates involved with salvage values include future estimated costs of dismantlement and repair market prices environmental regulations and technological advancements Dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate salvage values and the timing of disposal the salvage values actually realized for our assets could significantly increase or decrease resulting in additional gains or losses in the year of disposal We depreciate our assets under the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease term using an estimated salvage value which approximates of the depreciable cost basis for our power plant assets where we own the land or have a favorable option to purchase the land at conclusion of the lease term and approximately of the depreciable costs basis for our rotable equipment We use component depreciation method for our rotable parts and composite depreciation method for all the other power plant asset groups and Geysers Assets During we reviewed our accounting policies related to depreciation including our estimates of useful lives and salvage values We determined changing from composite depreciation to component depreciation for our rotable natural gas fired power plant assets and changing our Geysers Assets depreciation from the units of production method to the straight line method was preferable under U S GAAP In addition we completed a depreciable life study of our natural gas fired power plants and Geysers Assets and determined that a change in the depreciable lives of our natural gas fired power plants and Geysers Assets was appropriate See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our changes in depreciation Impairments We evaluate our long lived assets such as property plant and equipment equity method investments turbine equipment and specifically identified intangibles on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable Examples of such events or changes in circumstances are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition an adverse action by a regulator or legislature or an adverse change in the business climate an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life When we believe an impairment condition may have occurred we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used If we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset or if we have classified an asset as held for sale we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss Significant judgment is required in determining fair value as discussed above in Fair Value Measurements Equipment assigned to each power plant is not evaluated for impairment separately instead we evaluate our operating power plants and related equipment as a whole unit All construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value If it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations the carrying values of the projects would be written down to their fair value When we determine that our assets meet the assets held for sale criteria they are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell We are also required to evaluate our equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired when the value is considered an other than a temporary decline in value See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our impairment evaluation of long lived assets Accounting for Income Taxes To arrive at our consolidated income tax provision and other tax balances significant judgment and estimates are required Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical tax provisions and accruals Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision other tax accounts and net income in the period in which such determination is made For federal income tax reporting purposes our historical tax reporting group was comprised primarily of two separate groups CCFC and its subsidiaries which we referred to as the CCFC group and Calpine Corporation and its subsidiaries other than CCFC which we referred to as the Calpine group During the first quarter of we elected to consolidate our CCFC and Calpine groups for federal income tax reporting purposes and Calpine will file a consolidated federal income tax return for the year ended December that will include the CCFC group As a result of the consolidation the CCFC group deferred tax liabilities will be eligible to offset existing Calpine group NOLs that were reserved by a valuation allowance Accordingly we recorded a one time federal deferred income tax benefit of approximately million during the first quarter of to reduce our valuation allowance For the years ended December and the CCFC group was deconsolidated from the Calpine group for federal income tax reporting purposes See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our Calpine and CCFC groups Our NOL carryforwards consist primarily of federal NOL carryforwards of approximately billion which expire between and and NOL carryforwards in states and the District of Columbia totaling approximately billion which expire between and substantially all of which are offset with a full valuation allowance We also have approximately billion in foreign NOLs substantially all of which are offset with a full valuation allowance The NOL carryforwards available are subject to limitations on their annual usage Under federal and applicable state income tax laws a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year NOLs carried forward from prior years subject to certain time limitations as prescribed by the taxing authorities Under federal income tax law our NOL carryforwards can be utilized to reduce future taxable income subject to certain limitations including if we were to undergo an ownership change as defined by Section of the IRC We experienced an ownership change on the Effective Date as a result of the cancellation of our old common stock and the distribution of our new common stock pursuant to our Plan of Reorganization However this ownership change and the resulting annual limitations are not expected to result in the expiration of our NOL carryforwards if we are able to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carryforward periods At December approximately billion of our billion federal NOLs are not subject to annual Section limitations When considering our cumulative annual Section limitations in addition to our post Effective Date NOLs that are not limited our total unrestricted NOLs are approximately billion If a subsequent ownership change were to occur as a result of future transactions in our common stock accompanied by a significant reduction in our market value immediately prior to the ownership change our ability to utilize the NOL carryforwards may be significantly limited Under state income tax laws our NOL carryforwards can be utilized to reduce future taxable income subject to certain limitations including if we were to undergo an ownership change as defined by Section of the IRC During we analyzed the effect of our change in ownership on the Effective Date for each of our significant states to determine the amount of our NOL limitation The analysis determined that million of our state NOLs are expected to expire unutilized as a result of statutory limitations on the use of some of our pre emergence state NOLs as of the Effective Date or the cessation of business operations in various tax jurisdictions We reduced our deferred tax asset for state NOLs that we are unable to utilize and made an equal reduction in our valuation allowance The result did not have an impact on our income tax expense in In we will continue with our analysis and adjust our state NOLs where appropriate In the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the treatment of capital assets financing transactions multistate taxation of operations and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority We reverse a previously recognized tax position in the first period in which it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination The determination and calculation of uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the application of complex tax laws Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations As of December we had million of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions See Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our accounting for income taxes ]]></c>
