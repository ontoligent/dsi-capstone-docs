shipped in the current and previous fiscal year The shipped and installed PASSUR Systems are capitalized as part of the Company owned PASSUR Network The Company will continue to expand the PASSUR Network by shipping and installing additional PASSUR Systems throughout fiscal year Management anticipates that future PASSUR sites will provide increased coverage for the PASSUR Network by increasing the Company s ability to contract with new customers at such locations and by providing existing customers with additional data solutions The Company will continue to market the business intelligence predictive analytics as well as decision support applications and solutions derived from the PASSUR Network directly to the aviation industry and organizations that serve or are served by the aviation industry There were one hundred and fifty five Company owned PASSUR Systems located at airports worldwide at the end of fiscal year Redundant PASSUR Systems have been installed at major customer locations Revenues Management concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence predictive analytics and decision support product applications utilizing data primarily derived from the PASSUR Network Such efforts include the continued development of new products professional services and existing product enhancements Page Revenues increased by or to in fiscal year from in fiscal year New customer subscriptions and existing customer upgrades to the Company s suite of software applications and new customer engagements for professional services accounted for and of this increase respectively The Company continues to develop and deploy new software applications and solutions as well as a wide selection of products which address customers needs easily delivered through web based applications as well as other new products which include stand alone professional services Cost of Revenues Costs associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor depreciation of PASSUR Network Systems amortization of capitalized software development costs communication costs data feeds allocated overhead costs travel and entertainment and consulting fees Also included in cost of revenues are costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR Network Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR Network Systems Additionally cost of revenues in each reporting period is impacted by the number of PASSUR Network units added to the Network which include the production shipment and installation of these assets which are capitalized to the PASSUR Network and capitalized costs associated with software development projects Both of these are referred to as Capitalized Assets and are depreciated and or amortized over their respective useful lives and charged to cost of revenues Cost of revenues increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to increases in payroll and related costs of depreciation and amortization of as well as an increase in communication costs When the Company ships and installs its PASSUR Network Systems there is a reduction in cost of revenues due to the fact that the labor related costs for these systems are capitalized rather than expensed as a component of costs of revenue Fewer systems were shipped and installed in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year which resulted in an increase in cost of revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year This increase in cost of revenues was partially offset by an increase of in the capitalization of software development costs as compared to fiscal year due primarily to the Company s increased investment in software development projects in the current fiscal year Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to the Company s investment in research and development in a substantial software product These increases consisted primarily of payroll and related costs The Company s research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company s existing hardware software and information products The Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in research and development to develop maintain and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers There were no customer sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years or Research and development expenses are funded by current operations Selling General and Administrative Selling general and administrative expenses increased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs Income from Operations Revenues increased by or to total costs and expenses increased by or to and income from operations increased by or to in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year Page Interest Expense Related Party Interest expense related party decreased by or in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to the fact that on May the Company entered into a transaction that reduced its outstanding notes payable to G S Beckwith Gilbert the Company s significant shareholder and Chairman by as a result of the transaction described in Private Placement below On September the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement reducing the annual interest rate from to an annual rate of payable in cash and the Company s option to pay the remaining interest of per annum in cash or paid in kind was discontinued as a result of the transaction described in Liquidity and Capital Resources below Income Taxes The Company s provision for income taxes in each year consists of current state and local minimum taxes At October the Company had available a federal net operating loss carry forward of for income tax purposes which will expire in various tax years from through The Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required each reporting period A valuation allowance is established if based on the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized During the Company reversed of a total valuation allowance of related to deferred tax assets since it was determined that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized This determination was primarily based on cumulative positive earnings in recent years and projected taxable income in the future In evaluating whether or not to realize a deferred tax asset the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results and a forecast of future taxable income Net Income The Company had net income of or per diluted share in fiscal year as compared to net income of or per diluted share in fiscal year Impact of Inflation In the opinion of management inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the Company including selling prices capital expenditures and operating expenses Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s current liabilities exceeded current assets by at October The note payable to a related party was at October with a maturity of November The Company s stockholders equity was at October The Company had net income of for fiscal year Management is addressing the Company s working capital deficiency by aggressively marketing the Company s PASSUR Network Systems information capabilities in its existing product and professional service lines as well as in new products and professional services which are continually being developed and deployed Management believes that expanding its existing suite of software products and professional services which address the wide array of needs of the aviation industry through the continued development of new product and service offerings will continue to lead to increased growth in the Company s customer base and subscription based revenues Additionally if the Company s business plan does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the Company s operating cash requirements the Company will attempt to obtain external financing and if such external financing is not obtained the Company has received an unconditional and irrevocable commitment from its significant shareholder and Chairman to receive the necessary continuing financial support to meet such obligations through January Page Effective November the Company entered into an agreement renewing and extending the term of the notes payable due to G S Beckwith Gilbert the Company s significant shareholder and Chairman from one year to three years with a maturity of November Under the agreement beginning February and effective through October the interest rate was increased from to payable as follows interest at the annual rate of was payable in cash and the remaining interest at the annual rate of was payable at the option of the Company in cash or paid in kind and added to the principal of the notes payable Annual interest payments were due at October of each fiscal year During October the Company entered into an agreement to extend the due date of the interest payment owed to Mr Gilbert on October to December This interest payment was paid in full by the Company prior to the extended due date During fiscal year Mr Gilbert loaned the Company an additional bringing the principal amount of the notes payable due to Mr Gilbert to on October In fiscal year Mr Gilbert loaned the Company an additional which was used in part to fund the prior fiscal year s interest payment thereby increasing the principal balance of the notes payable to During fiscal year the Company paid fiscal year interest to Mr Gilbert of representing the entire cash portion of the fiscal year interest due thereby meeting the cash payment requirements of the loan agreement Total cash payments for interest made to Mr Gilbert in fiscal year were including the remaining fiscal year interest payment The balance of the fiscal year interest payable of was accrued In October the Company made a principal payment reducing the loan principal to resulting in a total of due to Mr Gilbert on October On May as a result of the transactions described in Private Placement below the Company s outstanding notes payable to Mr Gilbert were reduced by and a new note payable was issued to Mr Gilbert in the amount of The new note payable bears a maturity date of November and an annual interest rate of payable as follows interest at the annual rate of will be payable in cash and the remaining interest of per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or paid in kind and added to the principal of the note payable Interest payments are to be made annually on October of each year On September the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement reducing the annual interest rate from to an annual rate of payable in cash and the Company s option to pay the remaining interest of per annum in cash or paid in kind was discontinued During fiscal year the Company paid fiscal year interest to Mr Gilbert of representing the entire fiscal year interest due thereby meeting the payment requirements of the loan agreement Total payments for interest made to Mr Gilbert in fiscal year were including the remaining fiscal year interest payment The Company has received a commitment from Mr Gilbert dated January that if the Company at any time is unable to meet its obligations through January Mr Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations Such commitment for financial support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company in addition to the deferral of principal and or interest payments due on the existing loans if deemed necessary The note payable is secured by the Company s assets The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet operating and investment requirements through October During such period the Company does not anticipate borrowing additional funds from Mr Gilbert although it has received a commitment from Mr Gilbert to do so if the Company requires additional funds Net cash provided by operating activities was for fiscal year and consisted of non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization of and stock based compensation expense offset by a deferred tax allowance reversal of as well as of net income and a decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of customer invoicing This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of of accrued interest related party as well as decreases in deferred revenue and accounts payable primarily due to the timing of vendor invoice payments Net cash used in investing activities was for fiscal year expended primarily for capitalized software development costs Net cash used in financing activities was for fiscal year and consisted of repayments of notes payable related party and private placement expenditures offset by proceeds from stock issuance and proceeds from the exercise of stock options Page The Company s revenue has increased as a result of its subscription based revenue model The Company is actively addressing the increasing costs associated with supporting the business and plans to identify and reduce any unnecessary costs as part of its cost reduction initiatives Additionally the aviation market has been impacted by budgetary constraints airline bankruptcies and consolidations due to the downturn in the current economy the terrorist events of September the continued war on terrorism and changes in fuel costs The aviation market is extensively regulated by government agencies particularly the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board and management anticipates that new regulations relating to air travel may continue to be issued Substantially all of the Company s revenues are derived from airports airlines and organizations that serve or are served by the aviation industry Any new regulations or changes in the economic situation of the aviation industry could have an impact on the future operations of the Company either positively or negatively Interest by potential customers in the information and decision support software products obtained from PASSUR Network Systems and its professional services remains strong As a result the Company anticipates an increase in future revenues However the Company cannot predict if such revenues will materialize If sales do not increase losses may occur The extent of such profits or losses will be dependent on sales volume achieved and Company cost reduction initiatives Private Placement On May the Company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell shares of the Company s common stock subject to trading restrictions in a private placement financing with a select group of accredited investors including certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company shares of restricted common stock were sold to non affiliated investors at a price of per share and shares of restricted common stock were sold to three of the Company s Directors at a price of per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of In addition on the same day the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Mr Gilbert pursuant to which the Company repaid from the private placement proceeds of principal on the outstanding notes payable to Mr Gilbert and converted of the principal amount of the notes payable held by Mr Gilbert into shares of common stock subject to trading restrictions A new note payable was issued to Mr Gilbert equal to the remaining principal balance of the existing notes payable following such conversion The stock issued by the Company to Mr Gilbert was done so based on the trading price of the Company s stock and thus considered to be fair value based on a Level input per ASC Topic Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and accordingly no gain or loss resulted from the conversion The new note payable bears a maturity date of November and an annual interest rate of payable as follows interest at the annual rate of will be payable in cash and the remaining interest of per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or paid in kind and added to the principal of the note payable Interest payments will be made annually on October of each year On September the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement reducing the annual interest rate from to an annual rate of payable in cash and the Company s option to pay the remaining interest of per annum in cash or paid in kind was discontinued Off Balance Sheet Arrangements None Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates General The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company s business operations are discussed its reported financial results The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions The Company s accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment and estimates include Page Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements SAB SAB requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured The Company also recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC SOP Software Revenue Recognition as amended when applicable The Company s revenues are generated by selling subscription based real time decision and solutions information as well as software products professional services and annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR Radar Systems Revenues generated from subscription and maintenance agreements are recognized over the term of such executed agreements and or customer s receipt of such data or services In accordance with ASC we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products or performance of maintenance when all of the following criteria are met we have evidence of an agreement with a customer we deliver the products services license or maintenance agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement such that the sale may not be complete and or final and collection is probable The Company records revenues pursuant to individual contracts on a month by month basis as outlined by the applicable agreement In many cases the Company may invoice respective customers in advance of the specified period either quarterly or annually which coincides with the terms of the agreement In such cases the Company will defer at the close of each month and or reporting period any subscription or maintenance revenues invoiced for which services have yet to be rendered in accordance with ASC Our software licenses usually do not include acceptance provisions An acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to a binding agreement to license the software If a subscription agreement includes an acceptance provision the Company will not recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or if not notified by the customer to cancel the subscription agreement the expiration of the acceptance period From time to time the Company will receive one time payments from customers for rights including but not limited to the rights to use certain data at an agreed upon location s for a specific use and or for an unlimited number of users Such one time payments are in the form of license fees These fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement or expected useful life of such license arrangement whichever is longer but typically five years Deferred revenue is classified on the Company s balance sheet as a liability until such time as revenue from services is properly recognized as revenue in accordance with SAB and or ASC and the corresponding agreement Capitalized Software Development Costs The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed Capitalized software development costs are comprised of costs incurred to develop and significantly enhance software products to be sold or otherwise marketed When technological feasibility is established the Company begins to capitalize development costs and once the software product is available for general release to the public the Company begins to amortize such costs to cost of revenues The Company s policy on capitalized software costs determines whether the costs incurred are classified as capitalized costs in accordance with ASC or as research and development expenses In cases where the Company capitalizes costs incurred with development of new hardware software products a product specification is developed as the guideline for the capitalization of costs associated with such project in accordance with ASC Once a product has been made available for sale and or released for sale to the general public the development costs of that product are no longer capitalized and amortization is provided on a product by product basis based on the greater of the ratio of current gross revenues to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning at the point the product becomes available for general release typically over five years Costs incurred to maintain or support such product are expensed as incurred In some cases the Company may capitalize costs incurred in the development of enhanced versions of already existing products but will immediately expense any additional costs incurred to maintain products which were completed and released to the general public in accordance with ASC Determining and evaluating whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization requires the exercise of judgment by management Page The Company s net capitalized software costs totaled at October The carrying value of capitalized software costs are evaluated for impairment based on the forecasted and actual future cash flows expected to be generated from such assets as determined and evaluated by management Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets The Company reviews long lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Impairment is recognized to the extent the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell The Company evaluates the periods of amortization continually in determining whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives If estimates are changed the unamortized costs will be allocated to the increased or decreased number of remaining periods in the revised life The Company s long lived assets which include the PASSUR Network and property plant and equipment totaled and accounted for of the Company s total assets as of October At each reporting period management evaluates the carrying values of the Company s assets The evaluation considers the undiscounted cash flows generated from current contractual revenue sources and the anticipated forecast revenue derived from each asset The Company then evaluates these revenues on an overall basis to determine if any impairment issues exist As of October based upon management s evaluation of the above asset groups no impairment of these asset groups exist If these forecasts are not met the Company may have to record impairment charges not previously recorded Depreciation and Amortization The net PASSUR Network net capitalized software development costs and net property plant and equipment totaled and respectively at October Total depreciation and amortization expense related to these capitalized assets was in fiscal year In management s judgment the estimated depreciable lives used to calculate the annual depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows PASSUR Network years Capitalized software development costs years Property plant and equipment to years The PASSUR Network includes PASSUR Systems and the related software workstations used for the data derived from PASSUR Systems as well as costs pertaining to raw material work in process and finished goods components PASSUR Network installations include the direct and indirect production and installation costs incurred for each of the Company owned PASSUR Systems PASSUR Network Systems which are not installed in the PASSUR Network are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded Once installed the PASSUR Systems are depreciated over seven years All of the Company s capitalized assets are recorded at cost which may also include salaries and related overhead costs incurred during production and or development and depreciated and or amortized over the asset s estimated useful life for financial statement purposes The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and industry standards for similar assets Circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments see Impairment of Long Lived Assets above are identified and prospective depreciation or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly Page Total depreciation and amortization expense was in fiscal year and consisted of and for the PASSUR Network capitalized software development costs and property plant and equipment respectively Stock Based Compensation The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC SFAS R Share Based Payments which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest The fair value of stock options was determined using the Black Scholes valuation model Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period net of forfeitures Stock based compensation expense was and in fiscal years and respectively and was primarily included in selling general and administrative expenses Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income Specifically the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance We do not expect that the adoption of this disclosure only guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial results and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal In May the FASB issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements This guidance amends United States generally accepted accounting principles U S GAAP to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS The amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in U S GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements This includes clarification of the Board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements In addition to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that U S GAAP and IFRS fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way for example using the word shall rather than should to describe the requirements in U S GAAP This amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on results of operations or financial position Risk Not Required ]]></c>

operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States US GAAP A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of ESW s financial statements and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on ESW s financial condition and results of operations Specifically critical accounting estimates generally require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and if different estimates or judgments were used the use of these estimates or judgments would have a material effect on ESW s financial condition or results of operations The estimates and judgments ESW makes that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities revenues and expenses are based on historical experience and on various other factors which ESW believes to be reasonable in the circumstances under which they are made Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions ESW considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition the valuation of inventories research and development and accounting for the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to be critical accounting policies The Company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note to the Financial Statements of this K report MARKET RISK ESW is exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates The Company has foreign currency exposures at its foreign operations related to buying and selling currencies other than the local currencies The risk under these interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreement is not considered to be significant FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ESW s exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses also arises from the translation of the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries to U S dollars during consolidation These risks have been significantly mitigated by the move of ESW s manufacturing operations to PA USA During the year the Company changed the functional currency of its Canadian operations from the Canadian dollar to the U S dollar see Note Prior to this change ESW recognized a translation loss of in as compared to a gain of in reported as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity deficit Following the change in accounting policy ESW recognized a translation loss of which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss Also included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December ESW has recognized a translation loss of as compared to a loss of in primarily as a result of exchange rate differences between the U S dollar and the Canadian dollar INTEREST RATE RISK ESW currently has no variable rate long term debt that exposes ESW to interest rate risk ]]></c>

operations and cash flows This guidance was effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after November The Company adopted this guidance on January Accounting For Natural Gas and Oil Producing Activities We use the full cost method to account for our natural gas and oil producing activities Under this accounting method we capitalize substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition development and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves in full cost pools maintained by geographic areas regardless of whether reserves are actually discovered and apply a quarterly full cost ceiling test Adverse changes in conditions primarily gas price declines could result in permanent write downs in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as well as non cash charges to operations but would not affect cash flows Property Equipment and Depreciation We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the acquisition of methane petroleum and natural gas interests are capitalized Under this method all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs annual carrying charges of non producing properties geological and geophysical costs costs of drilling and equipping productive and non productive wells and direct exploration salaries and related benefits Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas properties are recorded as a reduction of the related capitalized costs without recognition of a gain or loss unless the disposal would result in a change of percent or more in the depletion rate Depreciation and depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based upon estimates of proved reserves as determined by independent consultants with oil and gas being converted to a common unit of measure based on their relative energy content The costs of acquisition and exploration of unproved oil and gas properties including any related capitalized interest expense are not subject to depletion but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage are also not subject to depletion Costs not subject to depletion are periodically assessed for possible impairment or reductions in value If a reduction in value has occurred costs subject to depletion are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those operations where a reserve base is not yet established Estimated future removal and site restoration costs are provided over the life of proven reserves on units of production basis Costs which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation are estimated each period by management based on current regulations actual expenses incurred and technology and industry standards The charge is included in the provision for depletion and depreciation and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred We apply a ceiling test to capitalized costs which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value using a ten percent discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from production of proven reserves at year end at market prices less future production administrative financing site restoration and income tax costs plus the lower of cost or estimated market value of unproved properties If capitalized costs are determined to exceed estimated future net revenues a write down of carrying value is charged to depletion in the period RISK N A ]]></c>

statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes as well as how particular accounting principles affect our financial statements This discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business so you may better understand how those segments and their results affect our financial condition and results of operations as a whole Finally we have identified and discussed trends known to management that we believe are likely to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of December and and the two years then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements You are also urged to consider the information under the caption Summary of Critical Accounting Policies Summary We are the world s largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft related items Our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores We have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices The key to our success is our ability to grow our base business We grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations We intend to continue to expand both domestically and internationally We operate in three segments First Wholesale Leathercraft consisting of our Leather Factory stores and our national account sales group which sells to large national store chains is our oldest segment with sales of million in Historically in normal economic conditions this division has generally offered steady but very modest increases in sales Sales in increased compared to Compared to the wholesale stores sales increased and national account sales were up Sales at our stores are showing signs of recovery despite cautious consumer spending as a result of the weak U S economy Sales to national accounts tend to be less consistent Since acquiring its assets in Tandy Leather has been re established as the operator of retail leathercraft stores Prior to our acquisition in all of the Tandy Leather retail stores had been closed These retail stores comprise our Retail Leathercraft segment This segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales million in up from million in and is our largest source of revenues We expect to grow the number of stores to from stores in operation at the end of Our pace of store openings has slowed in the last several years due to the general economic conditions in the U S and because of the lack of personnel qualified for store manager positions We expect to continue to open stores domestically but have not committed to a specific time frame at this point While the store opening schedule has slowed we are generally attempting to relocate existing stores as the leases come up for renewal into larger spaces so that a larger amount of product is available to customers We believe that the increase in sales in this segment suggests that the store relocation strategy is successful Our International Leathercraft segment consists of company owned stores located outside of North America At December two combination retail wholesale stores with one located in the United Kingdom and the other located in Australia comprised this segment In January we opened a store in Spain bringing the number of stores in this segment to three It is our intention to open more stores in this segment once we have a large enough

of sales our gross margin fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally Our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on going process and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors Sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels Therefore as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix higher gross margins tend to follow Finally there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer As a result our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period For our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to Our cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from to Fluctuations in gross margin are primarily due to sales mix Retail sales are at a higher gross margin than that of

over the next several years with plans to open at least one store in in North America We remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and

decreased from million at the end of to million at December We are pleased with the slight reduction in our inventory investment at December However as we continue our store expansion and relocation we expect our inventory to increase Further continued sales increases are partially dependent on product availability in our stores We will continue to look for large purchasing opportunities of product at aggressive pricing in order to support our gross margin goals We attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected expansion We ended the year with our total inventory on hand approximately below our internal targets for optimal inventory Consolidated inventory turned times during a slight improvement from the turns at times We compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory By operating division inventory turns are as follows Segment Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Wholesale Leathercraft stores only Retail Leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of Wholesale Leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores The retail stores have no warehouse backstock inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse Wholesale Leathercraft s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores Accounts payable totaled million at the end of up from million at the end of TABLE OF CONTENTS As discussed above the largest use of operating cash in was the decrease in accrued expenses specifically the decrease in the amount of inventory in transit Cash paid for capital expenditures totaled million and million for the years ended December and respectively In the primary capital expenditure was store fixtures either for new stores or for relocated or remodeled stores Fixtures and equipment for the new international stores totaled We moved or remodeled stores in the US in Fixtures for those stores totaled Fixtures for the new U S store opened in totaled Other capital expenditures were building improvements including a video surveillance system computer equipment website development and factory machines and dies In the primary capital expenditure was the construction of a building to be used for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the staging of drop shipments of specially purchased product to our stores Other capital expenditures were building improvements including a generator store fixtures computer equipment and factory machines and dies We intend to open one to two stores in the U S and one to two stores abroad in having already opened one store in Spain in January and therefore we expect to incur some capital expenditures related to these store openings In addition we intend to continue to relocate US stores into larger space as leases permit and therefore expect to incur capital expenditures namely fixtures related to these moves Therefore we expect our capital expenditures to be comparable to that of our expenditures Cash applied toward stock repurchases totaled and in and respectively There were no stock repurchases in We believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in while also funding our expansion plans At this time we know of no trends or demands commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity capital resources or results of operations In addition we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments We could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow In particular because of the relatively small investment required by each new store we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during and and we do not currently have any such arrangements Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December not including related interest expense Payments Due by Periods Contractual Obligations Total Less than Year Years Years More than Years Long Term Debt Operating Leases Total Contractual Obligations ____________________ Our loan from JPMorgan Chase matures in May These are our leased facilities Summary of Critical Accounting Policies We strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology We follow generally accepted accounting principles in the U S in preparing our consolidated financial statements These principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations We continually review our accounting policies how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements Following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements Basis of Consolidation We report our financial information on a consolidated basis Therefore unless there is an indication to the contrary financial information is provided for the parent company Tandy Leather Factory Inc and its subsidiaries as a whole Transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose We own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated None of our subsidiaries are off balance sheet Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue for retail over the counter sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured which generally occurs upon shipment Net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances product returns and allowances for defective merchandise Allowance for Accounts Receivable We reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future This allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition past collection history and the aging of the account If the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments additional allowances may be required Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the first in first out method This means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold In addition we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow moving or obsolete inventory This reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand If actual future demand is less favorable than what we project additional write downs may be necessary Goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier Goodwill We periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carrying value As of December we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the operating divisions associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances If actual financial performance of these divisions differs significantly from our projections such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the SEC or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of Forward looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events Words such as may assume forecast position predict strategy expect intend plan estimate anticipate believe project budget potential or continue and similar expressions are used to identify forward looking statements They can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties Consequently no forward looking statements can be guaranteed Actual results may vary materially You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to the risk factors described in Item A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form K Management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements We do not intend to update forward looking statements TABLE OF CONTENTS We face exposure to financial market risks including adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates These exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results We do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our foreign subsidiaries as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates impact the U S dollar amount of revenue and expenses See Note to the Consolidated Financial Statements Segment Information for financial information concerning our foreign activities Interest Rate Risk In the past we have been subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt However our current credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase includes a fixed interest rate Therefore changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area TABLE OF CONTENTS

following discussion and analysis is to provide an overview of the business to help facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing our historical operating results financial condition and cash flows and also to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known trends events or uncertainties that may impact our future results The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on Form K contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as statements of our plans strategies objectives expectations intentions and adequacy of resources Forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements Words such as anticipate believe continue estimate expect intend may plan potential predict project or similar words or phrases or the negatives of these words may identify forward looking statements but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking Examples of forward looking statements include among others statements regarding the integration of our acquired technologies with our existing technology the commercial launch of new products and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities This discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form K including Item Business Item A Risk Factors Item Selected Financial Data and Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Overview We develop manufacture and sell products and services for genetic analysis to the life science research and clinical healthcare markets Researchers around the world use our technology to better understand the role that genes play in disease the effectiveness and safety of therapies and many other biological factors that affect human well being We sell our products to some of the world s largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and biotechnology companies as well as leading academic government and not for profit research institutions and more than peer reviewed papers have been published based on work using our products We have almost employees worldwide and maintain sales and distribution operations across the United States Europe Asia and Latin America We offer a comprehensive line of products for two principal applications gene expression and genotyping Our product sales consist primarily of sales of instruments and related consumables We have three instrument systems GeneTitan GeneChip and GeneAtlas that include instruments consumables and software Our GeneChip instruments run arrays packaged in cartridges and our GeneTitan and GeneAtlas TM instruments run arrays packaged in a peg format We also offer a variety of assays for gene expression targeting low to mid plex markets that are downstream of our whole genome arrays and a range of reagent kits that are compatible with our platforms as well as the products of other vendors Overview of Fiscal Year and Strategic Initiatives In our business was affected by a significant drop in the volume of sales of consumables to our academic and pharmaceutical customers particularly in North America which led to a decrease in revenue as compared to the same period in Primarily due to lower revenues from product sales we incurred a net loss of million for the year Despite the lower revenues we were able to generate cash flows from operations of almost million in Our focus remains on carrying out the following strategic initiatives Entering new markets and expanding our product lines Our goal continues to be to expand our revenue base by entering new markets growing our customer base and successfully commercializing our established and acquired technologies In the future we intend to continue to expand our focus to include the validation and routine testing markets which we believe offer attractive compound annual growth rates and opportunities for more recurring revenue growth in the future We seek to expand our product line with new products that combine automated instrumentation powerful new biological assays and new array designs and content Table of Contents Improving operating leverage We remain focused on improving our operating leverage and were successful in lowering our operating expenses in as compared to Profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to increasing top line revenue and sustained operating leverage CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESTIMATES General judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Our significant accounting policies are fully described in Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Summary of Significant Accounting Policies However certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the financial statements Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements REVENUE RECOGNITION We enter into contracts to sell our products and while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions As a result significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and if so how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements when and how to recognize revenue for each element and the period over which revenue should be recognized INVENTORIES We enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products The business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand We perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period which includes a review of among other factors demand requirements product life cycle and development plans component cost trends product pricing product expiration and quality issues Based on this analysis we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess obsolete or impaired goods when appropriate in order to report inventory at net realizable value These inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand component costs supplier arrangements or product life cycles differ from our estimates Any such adjustments would result in a charge to our results of operations NON MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES As part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies These investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost We also invest in a limited partnership investment fund that is accounted for under the equity method We periodically review our investments for impairment however the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment The analysis may include assessment of the investee s i revenue and earnings trend ii business outlook for its products and technologies iii liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash and iv likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired We have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non marketable investments over the past few years Table of Contents INCOME TAXES Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income Under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse We must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations We believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate These factors include but are not limited to changes in overall levels character or geographical mix of pretax earnings changes in tax laws regulations and or rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities future levels of research and development spending nondeductible expenses applicability of tax holidays and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December was approximately million If recognized the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is million As of December we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months We classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense For the year ended December the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately million for a total cumulative amount of million of non current income taxes payable as of December We file U S federal state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations During November the U S Internal Revenue Service completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the and tax years and issued a Revenue Agent s Report or RAR with no proposed adjustments We consider all tax positions taken in the and tax years to be effectively settled because the U S Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote possibility that the U S Internal Revenue Service will re examine the settled positions As a result we have released reserves of approximately million related to uncertain tax positions for those periods and recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets However the federal and California statute of limitations on assessment still remain open for the tax years through In significant foreign jurisdictions the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities CONTINGENCIES We are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters Based on the information available at the balance sheet dates we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses If losses are probable and reasonably estimable we will record a reserve which may change in the future due to new developments in each matter ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED COMPENSATION We account for employee share based compensation by estimating the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions The most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock We determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends As required under the accounting rules we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and as a result we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee share based awards granted in future periods Table of Contents US GAAP requires that employee share based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period or the vesting period in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees Accordingly in we recognized employee share based compensation of million which consisted of million in cost of product sales million in research and development expense and million in selling general and administrative expenses As of December million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested employee stock awards is expected to be recognized as future cost of sales and operating expenses over a weighted average period of years RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December and PRODUCT SALES The components of product sales are as follows Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Consumables Instruments Total product sales Total product sales decreased in as compared to primarily due to volume decreases Chip volumes shipped were lower across all products while overall average selling price remained flat Reagent revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume Genechip shipments combined with lower average selling price caused by a shift in product mix Instruments were lower due to fewer GeneTitan sales partially offset by increased sales of the lower priced GeneAtlas Total product sales decreased million or in as compared to Consumables sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in the sales of our RNA reagents partially offset by an increase in sales of our DNA reagents In both areas sales of our lower price products have increased as a percentage of the total mix Instrument sales grew in as compared to primarily due to the increased adoption of GeneTitan and introduction of GeneAtlas TM families of instruments which were introduced in late and early respectively partially offset by declines in the volume of sales of older instruments SERVICES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Services Total services revenue remained consistent in as compared to which was in line with our expectations Total services revenue decreased in as compared to primarily due to the completion in late of several genotyping projects that began in the fourth quarter of including the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and the National Institutes of Health projects Table of Contents ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Royalties and other revenue Royalties and other revenue in was higher as compared to and primarily due to the receipt of a non recurring million license payment that was received in the fourth quarter of In addition to the non recurring license payment royalties and other revenue was lower in as compared to due to lower royalties and research activity PRODUCT AND SERVICES GROSS MARGINS Dollars in thousands Dollar Point Year ended December change from Total gross margin on product sales Total gross margin on services Product gross margin as a percentage of product sales Service gross margin as a percentage of services Despite lower product sales in product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased during the year as compared to primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products along with lower material warranty and excess and obsolescence costs in as well as plant consolidation costs that occurred in These cost improvements were partially offset by lower cost absorption due to higher production levels in We note a downward trend in product gross margin within when comparing quarterly results driven by increased absorption cost due to lower sales Product gross margin increased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in plant consolidation costs from million in to million in as the majority of the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure took place in Additionally favorable pricing and absorption in chips contributed to the increased product margin These increases were partially offset by higher excess and obsolescence costs for products with finite lives Service gross margin increased in as compared to primarily due to costs associated with the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure that was completed in the second quarter of Service gross margin was lower in as compared to primarily as a result of the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and National Institutes of Health projects which had higher margins and were completed in RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Research and development Research and development expenses decreased in and as compared to primarily due to savings in head count related expenses and variable compensation of million and million respectively and decreased spending on supplies of million and million respectively as a result of cost control measures This was partially offset by an increase in facilities expenses primarily due to a one time expense of million related to the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara during the third quarter of Table of Contents SELLING GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Selling general and administrative Selling general and administrative expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to lower legal expenses of million as a result of a litigation settlement at the end of Other cost savings include variable compensation adjustments of million lower spending on consulting and other services of million and advertising expenses of million These savings were partially offset by one time severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer of million rent expense of million primarily due to the acceleration of future lease payments as a result of the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara and acquisition costs of million incurred on the anticipated eBioscience transaction In selling general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses of million as a result of lower headcount and decreased variable compensation Additionally legal expenses decreased by million primarily due to timing of legal proceedings with third parties consulting and purchased services decreased by million as a result of various general and administrative cost reductions and rent expense decreased by million due primarily to the relocation of our Japan office and other site consolidation efforts INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER NET The components of interest income and other net are as follows Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Interest income Realized loss on equity investments net Currency loss net Other Total interest income and other net Interest income and other net decreased in as compared to due to the following Realized loss on equity investments decreased in as compared to as we recognized fewer other than temporary impairments OTTI In we recognized million in OTTI on our non marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund a non marketable investment in a private biotechnology company and an investment classified as available for sale in a publicly traded company In we recognized million in OTTI on two non marketable investments Currency loss net increased primarily due to the weakening of the U S dollar against the Euro in as compared to and Other changed in due to a million provision against a note receivable from a private biotechnology company and a million impairment charge recorded against our West Sacramento facility during Table of Contents Interest income and other net changed by million in as compared to due to the following Interest income decreased by million in as compared to due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the repurchase of a portion of our convertible notes during partially offset by higher effective interest rates in Realized loss in equity investments increased by million in as we recognized million of other than temporary impairment expense largely as a result of our recognition of impairment charges on two non marketable investments This was partially offset by a net realized gain from our investment in a limited partnership investment fund of million In we recognized a net realized loss of million primarily due to OTTI on our non marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund Currency loss decreased in by million due to favorable currency movements in and Other income decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring sale of equipment in totaling million INTEREST EXPENSE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Interest expense Interest expense decreased in as compared to and primarily due to a lower aggregate principal balance of our convertible notes as a result of our repurchases totaling million in aggregate principal amount during There were no further purchases in INCOME TAX PROVISION BENEFIT Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December change from change from Income tax provision benefit The income tax provision was approximately million and million in and respectively which consisted primarily of foreign taxes The income tax benefit in of million consisted of foreign taxes similar to and offset by refundable U S credits Deferred tax assets are recognized if realization of such assets is more likely than not As of December we provided for a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets As a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position we have placed a full valuation allowance on U S and certain foreign deferred tax assets We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income As of December we had total net operating loss carryforwards of million comprised of million for U S federal purposes which expire in the years through if not utilized and million for state purposes the majority of which expire in the years through if not utilized Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization During due to potential future transactions that would require cash outflows we changed our assertion such that foreign earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested As a result we recorded a net deferred tax liability of approximately million related to the foreign undistributed earnings which was offset by a reduction in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Historically we have financed our operations primarily through product sales sales of equity and debt securities such as our convertible notes in collaborative agreements interest income licensing of our technology and when necessary financing arrangements with third party creditors Our cash outflows have generally been as follows cash used in operating activities such as research and development programs sales and marketing activity compensation and benefits of our employees and other working capital needs cash paid for acquisitions cash paid for litigation activity and settlements and cash used for our debt repurchases and repurchases of our convertible notes as well as interest payments on our convertible notes obligations As of December we had cash cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately million We anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations debt repayments or repurchases and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future These expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans which are subject to change and therefore we could require further funding Factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include but are not limited to financing arrangements that we may enter into in connection with our acquisition of eBioscience or future acquisitions a decline in cash generated by sales of our products and services our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements the progress of our research and development programs initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations the costs involved in preparing filing prosecuting defending and enforcing intellectual property rights the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements the purchase of patent licenses and other factors On November we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire eBioscience for approximately million in cash subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement The merger is subject to customary closing conditions including our receipt of financing for the merger In connection with the Merger Agreement we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for million of senior secured credit The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied and as a result we will not be able to complete the eBioscience acquisition unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured We are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience regarding the possibility of restructuring the committed financing but no agreement or understandings have been reached We have waived eBioscience s obligations under the non solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement and we understand that eBioscience is considering alternatives to the merger The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing of the merger has not occurred by March so long as a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate has not been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date On December we received notice that Tang Capital Partners LP a holder of our Senior Convertible Notes Due the Notes had commenced class action litigation against us in the Superior Court of California County of Santa Clara The complaint alleged a variety of claims relating to our proposed acquisition of eBioscience including that the acquisition would constitute a Fundamental Change under the indenture governing the Notes The complaint sought unspecified damages temporary and permanent injunctive relief against completion of the eBioscience acquisition and other remedies On January we entered into an agreement to settle the purported class action litigation As part of the settlement we agreed to commence a tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes at par plus accrued interest Tang Capital Partners LP which owned approximately million principal amount of the Notes agreed to tender all of its Notes into the offer Table of Contents As of December we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital To the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms or at all To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders If adequate funds are not available we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms Our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations From time to time we may seek to retire repurchase or exchange convertible securities or common stock in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions liquidity and contractual obligations and other factors We did not retire repurchase or exchange any of our common stock or remaining outstanding convertible securities during the year ended December As noted above on February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Cashflow in thousands Year ended December Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash provided by used in investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December was comprised of a net loss of million net of non cash charges of million and a million increase in working capital Adjustments for non cash expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of million a net realized loss on investments of million which included other than temporary impairment charges totaling million a provision against a notes receivable from a private biotechnology company of million an impairment charge on property and equipment of million and share based compensation expense of million Investing Activities We liquidated a number of investments during the fourth quarter of to fund the anticipated eBioscience acquisition that resulted in a net inflow from investing activities from the purchase sales and maturities of available for sale securities totaling million during Our investing activities further included capital expenditures of million and purchased technology rights of million in Financing Activities Our financing activities generally consist of stock option exercise activity under our employee stock plan Cash used in the issuance of stock under our employee stock plan net of treasury shares withheld for taxes was million for the year ended December Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December we had no off balance sheet arrangements The impact that our contractual obligations as of December are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands Total After Senior convertible notes Interest payments Operating leases Purchase commitments Total contractual obligations Our senior convertible notes are due in However holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on January and On February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Affymetrix and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million the timing of which is uncertain Refer to Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Income Taxes for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits In the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of Affymetrix Accordingly we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes Our risks risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall Due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk To achieve this objective we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U S Government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers and by policy restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years Table of Contents Periods of Maturity Fair Value at Thereafter Total December ASSETS Available for sale securities Average interest rate LIABILITIES senior convertible notes due Average interest rate In the security holders of our senior convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest On February we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to but not including the settlement date for the tender offer See Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note Subsequent Events in this Annual Report on Form K Periods of Maturity Fair Value at Thereafter Total December ASSETS Available

transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U S dollar equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U S dollar or foreign currency exchange rates These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated Other Comprehensive Income OCI and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income net if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring Any gain or loss after a hedge is de designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income net immediately The following table summarizes the notional amounts weighted average currency exchange rates and fair values of our unsettled foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December We had no unsettled hedging contracts at December All contracts have maturities of months or less Weighted average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U S dollars per foreign currency Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December notional amounts and fair values in U S

position for the past three years This review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables through included with this discussion and analysis Overview Compared to Net income for increased by over Earnings for were impacted by a bargain purchase gain and accelerated accretion on our preferred stock discount see discussion below Financial Highlights in thousands except per share data Change Earnings Net interest income Provision for loan losses non covered Provision for loan losses covered Noninterest income Noninterest expenses Income before income taxes Income tax expense Net income Preferred stock dividends Accretion of preferred stock discount Net income available to common shareholders Net income per common share Basic Diluted At Year End Assets Loans Deposits Ratios Return on average assets Return on average common equity Net interest margin taxable equivalent The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for compared to For the year ended December we reported net income available to common shareholders of million compared to million reported for Earnings per diluted common share were for the year ended December compared to for In the first quarter of we realized a million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank which is recorded in noninterest income The after tax impact of this gain on net income was million or per diluted common share In the third quarter of we recorded million of accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on the preferred stock that was redeemed during the quarter This stock was originally issued to the U S Treasury in January as part of the program known as TARP When this preferred stock was redeemed the remaining discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the stock which had been on a five year accretion schedule was immediately accreted as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders Total discount accretion of the preferred stock for was million or per diluted common share Table of Contents In both and we experienced significant write downs and losses associated with loans and foreclosed properties that were assumed in two failed bank acquisitions The amounts of the write downs and losses were less in than in but continued to significantly impact our earnings We note that our results of operation are significantly affected by the on going accounting for the two FDIC assisted failed bank acquisitions that we have completed In the discussion below the term covered is used to describe assets included as part of FDIC loss share agreements which generally result in the FDIC reimbursing the Company for of losses incurred For covered loans that deteriorate in terms of repayment expectations we record immediate allowances through the provision of loan losses For covered loans that experience favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date including loans that payoff we record positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan also referred to as loan discount accretion For foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values we record gains losses within noninterest income The adjustments discussed above are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income The adjustments noted above can result in volatility within individual income statement line items Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans discount accretion and losses from covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset Total assets at December amounted to billion a increase from a year earlier Total loans at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier and total deposits amounted to billion at December a increase from a year earlier Since the onset of the recession we have generally experienced declines in loans and deposits Normal loan paydowns loan charge offs and loan foreclosures have exceeded new loan growth which has provided the liquidity to lessen our reliance on high cost deposits However for the last half of we experienced modest growth in our non covered loan portfolio which increased million from June through year end We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve our asset yields as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our preferred stock as discussed in Note to the consolidated financial statements Brokered deposits remained at a low level at December comprising just of total deposits with internet deposits comprising an additional Net interest income for the year ended December amounted to million an increase of million or from The higher net interest income was primarily caused by an increase in in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions Loan discount accretion amounted to million for compared to million in an increase of million As previously discussed the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only of the gross amount of the change See Net Interest Income below for additional information Table of Contents Our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets for was compared to for The higher margin was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in loan discount accretion as well as a decline in funding costs Our provisions for loan losses remain elevated compared to historical levels primarily due to continued high unemployment rates and ongoing declines in property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans Our provision for loan losses for non covered loans amounted to million for compared to million recorded in The lower provision in was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non covered nonperforming loans We recorded million in provision for loan losses on covered loans during compared to million recorded in The lower provision in was due to declines in covered nonperforming loans resulting from the resolution of a significant amount of these loans through a combination of charge offs and foreclosures Our non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to at December Our covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December Noninterest income for the year ended December amounted to million compared to million for The decline in noninterest income in is primarily due to lower amounts of indemnification asset income recorded As previously discussed when we anticipate receiving additional amounts from the FDIC because of new losses identified in our covered loan and foreclosed property portfolios we record indemnification asset income for of the expected loss In fewer new losses were identified compared to and thus less indemnification asset income was recorded Noninterest expenses for the year ended December amounted to million a increase from the million recorded in The majority of the increase relates to personnel expense which increased partially due to employees joining the Company in the Bank of Asheville acquisition We also experienced higher employee medical expense due to higher claims in compared to We have also progressively built our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens collection activities and the overall growth of the Company and to prepare for future growth which has generally resulted in higher expenses across all categories Our effective tax rates were and for the years ended December and respectively Table of Contents Overview Compared to Net income was significantly lower in than in primarily due to a gain that resulted from the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June Most items of income and expense were higher in than in as a result of the Cooperative acquisition which impacted the Company for twelve months in compared to six months in beginning with the June acquisition date In our provision for loan losses increased significantly due to deterioration of asset quality which we believe was primarily caused by the recessionary economic environment including its unfavorable effect on real estate values Financial Highlights in

income taxes Income tax expense Net income Preferred stock dividends Accretion of preferred stock discount Net income available to common shareholders Net income per common share Basic Diluted At Year End Assets Loans Deposits Ratios Return on average assets Return on average common equity Net interest margin taxable equivalent The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for compared to For the year ended December we reported net income available to common shareholders of million compared to million reported for Earnings per diluted common share were for the year ended December compared to for In the second quarter of we realized a million gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank The after tax impact of this gain was million or per diluted common share Earnings reported for were impacted by write downs of foreclosed properties that were assumed in our failed bank acquisition and also by higher provisions for loan losses related both to loans acquired in the failed bank acquisition and to our legacy loans loans not obtained in the failed bank acquisition Total assets at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier Total loans at December amounted to billion a decrease from a year earlier and total deposits amounted to billion at December a decrease from a year earlier The contraction of our balance sheet was primarily a result of weak loan demand during which allowed us to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding Table of Contents We began experiencing a general decline in loans beginning in as the full effect of the recession took hold Loans declined approximately million or in Our deposits declined million or in The decrease was primarily associated with time deposits which are generally our highest cost source of funds We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program Net interest income for the year ended December amounted to million an increase from The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a higher net interest margin and the higher average balances of loans and deposits realized from the June Cooperative Bank acquisition Our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets for was compared to for During there were no changes in the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and we were able to continue to lower rates on our deposits especially on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher interest rates Also positively impacting net interest income were purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to our failed bank acquisition in including adjustments to loan interest income previously discussed See Net Interest Income below for additional discussion The economic environment including its unfavorable effect on real estate values resulted in an increase in our loan losses and nonperforming assets which led to significantly higher provisions for loan losses in Our provision for loan losses amounted to million for compared to million recorded in In our provision for loan losses was comprised of million in provisions related to non covered loans and million related to covered loans whereas in prior years the provision only related to non covered loans We recorded million and million in provision for loan losses during and respectively for non covered loans The higher provisions for loan losses were necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans We recorded million in provision for loan losses during related to covered loans that experienced credit quality deterioration The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent loans for which we received updated appraisals during that reflected lower valuations Net loan charge offs for were million compared to million in Net charge offs increased primarily as a result of declines in real estate values In net charge offs were also impacted by charge offs of covered loans and the recording of partial charge offs of non covered loans neither of which occurred during We recorded approximately million in charge offs of covered loans in compared to none in Also we recorded partial charge offs of non covered loans amounting to million during the fourth quarter of Previously we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses but did not record the charge offs until the loans were foreclosed upon Our non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to at December Table of Contents Our covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million at December Noninterest income for the year ended December amounted to million compared to million for In we recorded a million bargain purchase gain in connection with the acquisition of a failed bank In we recorded million in write downs and losses on foreclosed property the majority of which related to the market deterioration of foreclosed properties associated with the failed bank acquisition We recorded million in indemnification asset income related to higher than anticipated claims that we will be able to make with the FDIC under the loss share agreements primarily relating to loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write downs Noninterest expenses for the year ended December amounted to million a increase from the million recorded in Incremental operating expenses associated with the failed bank acquisition were the primary reason for the increases in Included in other operating expenses for were approximately million in costs net of FDIC reimbursements associated with collection activities on loans and foreclosed properties covered by FDIC loss share agreements compared to million in Our effective tax rates were and for the years ended December and respectively The lower effective tax rate in was primarily due to increased investment holdings of tax exempt municipal securities Outlook for We expect the banking industry particularly in our region to continue to face significant challenges in While there has been some favorable national economic data reported in recent months we have seen little if any improvement in the unfavorable economic statistics affecting our region These include unemployment rates housing starts home prices and the number of personal and business bankruptcies We believe that the Carolinas and Virginia may have been relatively late to experience the downturn in the national economy and that this region is lagging the rest of the country in recovery Thus we believe that our loan losses will continue to remain at elevated levels compared to historical norms We also expect that the weak economy will continue to result in low loan demand We believe that regulatory reform will negatively impact our earnings The regulatory climate is not favorable for banks We expect additional overhead costs will be necessary to comply with all of the new regulations expected to arise directly or indirectly from the Dodd Frank Act In and we acquired failed banks with approximately and million in assets respectively These acquisitions resulted in significant volatility to our earnings in and primarily as a result of the bargain purchase gains recorded on the acquisition dates that increased earnings and write downs of foreclosed properties in and that negatively impacted earnings While we expect the acquisitions to eventually be accretive to earnings on a consistent basis we believe that they may continue to add volatility to our reported earnings in The volatility may be positive to earnings which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans improves or negative to earnings which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans deteriorates or if the properties we have foreclosed on continue to decline in value Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation The allowance for loan losses intangible assets and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC assisted transactions are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements Allowance for Loan Losses Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses This model has two components The first component involves the estimation of losses on non single family home loans or relationships greater than that are defined as impaired loans A loan is considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement The estimated valuation allowance is the difference if any between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan s effective rate or in the case of a collateral dependent loan the fair value of the collateral The second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for impaired single family home loans impaired loans or relationships less than and all loans not considered to be impaired loans Impaired single family home loans impaired loans or relationships less than and loans that we have classified as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type based on the historical losses current economic conditions and operational conditions specific to each loan type Loans that we have risk graded as having more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired are segregated between those relationships with outstanding balances exceeding and those that are less than that amount For those loan relationships with outstanding balances exceeding we review the attributes of each individual loan and assign any necessary loss reserve based on various factors including payment history borrower strength collateral value and guarantor strength For loan relationships less than with more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired loss percentages are based on a multiple of the estimated loss rate for loans of a similar loan type with normal risk The multiples assigned vary by type of loan depending on risk and we have consulted with an external credit review firm in assigning those multiples The reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans This becomes our allocated allowance In addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model we also evaluate other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans net loan growth information nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data Based on this additional analysis we may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses This additional amount if any is our unallocated allowance The sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded Table of Contents Loans covered under loss share agreements are recorded at fair value at acquisition date Therefore amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become a part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan Proportional adjustments are also recorded to the FDIC indemnification asset Although we use the best information available to make evaluations future material adjustments may be necessary if economic operational or other conditions change In addition various regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process periodically review our allowance for loan losses Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations For further discussion see Nonperforming Assets and Summary of Loan Loss Experience below Intangible Assets Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements When we complete an acquisition transaction the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset with any remaining amount classified as goodwill Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment but not systematically amortized Assuming no goodwill impairment it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible whereas when we acquire an insurance agency the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions customer attrition runoff alternative funding costs deposit servicing costs and discount rates We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years with an accelerated rate of amortization For insurance agency acquisitions the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years with amortization occurring on a straight line basis Subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives as discussed above In addition on at least an annual basis goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value including goodwill our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions Table of Contents At our last goodwill impairment evaluation as of September we determined the fair value of our community banking operation was approximately per common share or higher than the stated book value of our common stock at the date of valuation To assist us in computing the fair value of our community banking operation we engaged a consulting firm who used various valuation techniques as part of their analysis which resulted in the conclusion of the value We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions such as those listed above Fair Value and Discount Accretion of Loans Acquired in FDIC Assisted Transactions We consider the determination of the initial fair value of loans acquired in FDIC assisted transactions the initial fair value of the related FDIC indemnification asset and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity We determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance However the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates the FDIC indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the FDIC Because of the inherent credit losses associated with the acquired loans in a failed bank acquisition the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers with the difference being referred to as the discount on the acquired loans We have applied the cost recovery method of accounting to all purchased impaired loans due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected cash flows This will result in the recognition of interest income on these impaired loans only when the cash payments received from the borrower exceed the recorded net book value of the related loans For nonimpaired purchased loans we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs Merger and Acquisition Activity In both and we completed a FDIC assisted transaction of a failed bank There were no significant acquisitions in The results of each acquired company branch are included in our financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions In October we announced that we had entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank headquartered in Whiteville North Carolina The agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches from Waccamaw Bank which includes assuming all deposits selected performing loans and all premises and equipment Deposits total approximately million and loans total approximately million This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information Table of Contents FDIC Indemnification Asset As previously discussed on June and January we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville respectively in FDIC assisted transactions For each transaction the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two loss share agreements with the FDIC which afford First Bank significant loss protection Under the Cooperative Bank loss share agreements the FDIC will cover of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to million and of losses in excess of that amount Under The Bank of Asheville loss share agreements the FDIC will cover of all covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses For both transactions the loss share reimbursements are applicable for ten years for single family home loans and five years for all other loans We have recorded a FDIC indemnification asset related to the two transactions to account for payments that we expect to receive from the FDIC related to the loss share agreements The carrying value of this receivable at each period end is the sum of actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been received and our estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied by the FDIC reimbursement percentage At December and the FDIC indemnification asset was comprised of the following components in thousands Receivable related to claims submitted not yet received Receivable related to estimated future claims on loans Receivable related to estimated future claims on other real estate owned FDIC indemnification asset As of each acquisition date based on the losses inherent in the covered assets and what we estimated we would receive as payments from the FDIC we recorded a FDIC Indemnification Asset Since that time we have recorded adjustments to the indemnification asset as discussed below The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted upwards in the following circumstances Deterioration of credit quality of covered loans As of the acquisition dates we recorded the loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville on our books at a fair value that was million and million respectively less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio As the credit quality of these portfolios change and better information is obtained about likely losses some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected For loans with worse repayment expectations we record provisions for loan losses with corresponding increases to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage In and we recorded provisions for loan losses on covered loans amounting to million and million respectively which resulted in an adjustment to the FDIC indemnification asset of million and million respectively There were no such adjustments in Write downs and losses on foreclosed properties When we foreclose on delinquent borrowers we initially record the foreclosed property at the lower of book or fair value based on current appraisals with any deficiency recorded as a charge off Subsequent to the foreclosure we periodically order updated appraisals and if the appraisal indicates a fair value lower than our carrying value we must write the property down Also periodically we sell foreclosed properties that result in losses Each of these situations results in the Company recording losses on other real estate owned with a corresponding increase to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage In and we recorded losses and write downs on covered foreclosed properties amounting to million and million respectively which resulted in upward adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset of million and million respectively There were no such adjustments in Table of Contents Expenses incurred related to collection activities on covered assets As a result of our collection efforts we incur expenses such as legal fees property taxes and appraisal costs Many of these expenses are reimbursable by the FDIC These expenses are recorded as other noninterest expenses and a corresponding increase is made to increase the FDIC indemnification asset by reducing the gross collection expenses by the amount expected to be reimbursed by the FDIC for eligible expenses In and we incurred million million and million in gross collection expenses related to covered assets respectively and reduced that amount by million million and million in FDIC reimbursements respectively The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted downwards in the following circumstances Receipt of cash from the FDIC related to claims submitted On at least a quarterly basis we submit eligible loss share claims to the FDIC After reviewing and approving the claims the FDIC wires us cash which reduces the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset In and we received million million and million in FDIC reimbursements respectively Accretion of discount on acquired loans As noted above we recorded the acquired loans of the two transactions on our books at a fair value that was million in total less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers the discount which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio As the credit quality of this portfolio changes and better information is obtained about likely losses some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected discussed above For loans with improved repayment expectations we are systematically reducing the discount over the life of the loan as it repays For some loans we have received complete payoffs at the contractual balance and the discount must be reduced to zero When we reduce accrete the discount we do so by recognizing interest income in that same amount When the expected losses on loans with improved repayment expectations becomes less than the original estimate our expected reimbursement from the FDIC declines as well Accordingly we reduce the FDIC indemnification asset by the corresponding reimbursement percentage In and we recorded discount accretion of million million and million respectively which resulted in a reduction of FDIC indemnification asset of million million and million respectively In summary circumstances that result in adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income The adjustments can result in volatility within individual income statement line items Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses interest income and losses from foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset Table of Contents The following presents a rollforward of the FDIC indemnification asset since the date of the Cooperative Bank acquisition on June in thousands Balance at June Decrease related to favorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Balance at December Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Balance at December Increase related to acquisition of The Bank of Asheville Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates Increase related to reimbursable expenses Cash received Accretion of loan discount Other Balance at December ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net interest income the spread between earnings on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities constitutes the largest source of our earnings Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries occupancy expense equipment expense and other overhead costs as well as the effects of income taxes Net Interest Income Net interest income on a reported basis amounted to million in million in and million in For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows we evaluate our net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax exempt securities to reported interest income Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis amounted to million in million in and million in Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non taxable investments that may have existed during those periods The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax equivalent net interest income Year ended December in thousands Net interest income as reported Tax equivalent adjustment Net interest income tax equivalent Table analyzes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis Our net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by in and in There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record changes in our loans and deposits balances and our net interest margin tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets Table of Contents For the increase in net interest income over the comparable period in was due to a higher net interest margin which was partially offset by a lower level of earning assets due to a contraction of our balance sheet during In higher average loan and deposit balances increased net interest income Also the positive effects of the increased balances in were enhanced by a higher net interest margin Although our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in early resulted in the addition of million in loans our average loan balances declined by million during the year from billion in to billion in We believe the decline in loans is primarily a direct and indirect result of the weak economy in our market area During we charged off million in loans and foreclosed on another million that reduced our loan balances with a portion of the charge off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions Also loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations With the decline in loans we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits which resulted in lower deposit balances and as discussed below a lower average cost of funds Although loans and deposits outstanding decreased during calendar year the average balances of loans and deposits were both higher in than they were in as a result of the Cooperative Bank acquisition that occurred in mid The loans and deposits acquired in this acquisition impacted loan and deposit balances outstanding for all twelve months of and for the six month period subsequent to the June acquisition As illustrated in Table the lower average loan and deposit balances negatively impacted net interest income in while higher balances positively impacted net interest income in In declines in interest earning assets primarily loans resulted in a decrease in interest income of million while lower amounts of interest bearing liabilities resulted in only million of lower interest expense As a result the net impact of lower loans and deposits was a decrease in tax equivalent net interest income of million in In growth in interest earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of million while higher amounts of interest bearing liabilities only resulted in million in increased interest expense As a result the higher average balances of loans and deposits resulted in an increase in tax equivalent net interest income of million in Table also illustrates the impact that changes in the interest rates that we earned paid had on our net interest income in and In both years lower interest rates on deposits was the primary factor affecting net interest income Although the prime rate of interest has not changed since interest rates on U S Treasury bonds and other interest sensitive financial instruments have steadily declined since then resulting in a generally lower interest rate environment In both years the progressively lower interest rate environment gave us the opportunity to reduce rates on matured time deposits and we were also able to gradually reduce interest rates on demand deposits In the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by million and in the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by million The lower interest rate environment had much less impact on our interest income with the impact of changes in interest rates lowering interest income by million in and increasing it by million in The lesser impact was due to continued use of interest rate floors on loans as well as the effect of higher levels of loan discount accretion in both and discussed below Overall changes in interest rates increased net interest income by million in and million in We measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled net interest margin which is defined as tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets Our net interest margin increased basis points in to from in Our net interest margin was in Table of Contents The primary reason for the increases in our net interest margin has been that the yields on interest earning assets have remained fairly stable over the past three years ranging from to while the cost of interest bearing liabilities has steadily declined from in to in to in As noted above our interest earning asset yields have remained stable because of the continued use of interest rate floors on loans as well as higher levels of loan discount accretion Also as noted above we have been able to lower rates on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher rates throughout and And to a lesser degree we have been able to progressively lower interest rates on various types of savings NOW and money market accounts We have also experienced declines in our levels of higher cost deposit balances including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits During each of the past three years our net interest margin also benefitted from the net accretion of purchase accounting premiums discounts associated with the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June and to a lesser degree the acquisition of Great Pee Dee Bancorp in April and The Bank of Asheville in January For and we recorded million million and million respectively in net accretion of purchase accounting premiums discounts that increased net interest income The following table provides detail of the purchase accounting adjustments that impacted net interest income in thousands Year Ended December Year Ended December Year Ended December Interest income reduced by premium amortization on loans Interest income increased by accretion of loan discount Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of deposits Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of borrowings Impact on net interest income The following table presents the purchase accounting entries that we expect to record in in thousands Expected Interest income reduced by premium amortization on loans Interest income increased by accretion of loan discount See note below Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of deposits Interest expense reduced by premium amortization of borrowings Impact on net interest income See note below Note We cannot determine the amount of interest income if any to be recognized from the accretion of the loan discount on Cooperative loans or The Bank of Asheville loans because it is reliant on our ongoing assessment during the year of the repayment period of the loans which is impacted by any changes in expected credit losses related to the loans See additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled Interest Rate Risk Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth an evaluation of the portfolio current economic conditions historical loan loss experience and other risk factors Our provisions for loan losses and nonperforming assets remain at what we believe to be elevated levels primarily due to high unemployment rates and declining property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans For and our total provisions for loan losses were million million and million respectively The total provision for loan losses is comprised of provision for loan losses for non covered loans and provision for loan losses for covered loans as discussed in the following paragraphs Table of Contents We recorded million million and million in provisions for loan losses related to non covered loans for the years ended December and respectively The lower provision for loan losses for non covered loans in compared to was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non covered nonperforming loans The higher provision for non covered loans in was necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans In and we recorded million and million in provisions for loan losses for covered loans respectively that experienced credit quality deterioration The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals in and that reflected lower valuations The lower provision for loan losses for covered loans in compared to was primarily due to lower levels of nonperforming covered loans Because of the FDIC loss share agreements in place for these loans the FDIC indemnification asset was adjusted upwards by recording noninterest income of million and million in and respectively or of the amount of the provisions see discussion above Total net charge offs for the years ended December and were million million and million respectively As discussed further below the higher net charge offs in and compared to were primarily a result of worsening economic conditions especially related to real estate that resulted in higher levels of borrowers not repaying their loans Net charge offs for non covered loans were million million and million for and respectively Net charge offs of non covered loans were impacted by million and million in partial charge offs of non covered loans for and respectively Prior to we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses but did not record charge offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon Net charge offs for covered loans were million million and in for and respectively The charge offs of covered loans were primarily a result of declining collateral values on collateral dependent nonaccrual loans In and our provisions for loan losses and net charge offs were concentrated in loans classified as real estate construction land development other land loans This category of loans is primarily comprised of land acquisition and development loans and other types of lot loans These types of loans have been particularly hard hit by the decline in real estate development and property values As can be seen in Table although we have reduced our exposure to this category of loans we continue to have exposure to this sector and future significant losses could result Non covered nonperforming assets at December amounted to million compared to million and million at December and respectively At December the ratio of non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets was compared to and at December and respectively Also see Nonperforming Assets below for additional discussion See the section entitled Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses The allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses Table of Contents Noninterest Income Our noninterest income amounted to million in million in and million in As shown in Table core noninterest income excludes gains from acquisitions foreclosed property write downs and losses indemnification asset income securities gains or losses and other miscellaneous gains and losses Core noninterest income amounted to million in a increase from million in The core noninterest income of million was higher than the million recorded in See Table and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income Service charges on deposit accounts in amounted to million a decrease compared to million recorded in The million recorded in was less than the amount of million Legislation that became effective on July reduced our fees earned on overdrafts in and which was the primary reason for the declines in this component of noninterest income Specifically the legislation now prohibits us from charging an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents or opts in to our payment of overdrafts for these transactions Additional regulations on overdraft fees became effective July that further reduced our overdraft fees although to a lesser extent than the changes In April we implemented new fees on deposit accounts such as fees for customers that elect to receive paper statements that have helped to replace a large portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the overdraft legislation Other service charges commissions and fees amounted to million in a increase from the million earned in The amount of million was a increase from the million earned in This category of noninterest income includes items such as electronic payment processing revenue which includes fees related to credit card transactions by merchants and customers and fees earned from debit card transactions ATM charges safety deposit box rentals fees from sales of personalized checks and check cashing fees The growth in this category for both years was primarily attributable to increased debit card usage by our customers as we earn a small fee each time our customers make a debit card transaction Also part of the increase in this category is due to the overall growth in our total customer base including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions Fees from presold mortgages amounted to million in million in and million in We continue to experience higher mortgage refinance activity due to lower interest rates Commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to million in each of and This line item includes commissions we receive from three sources sales of credit life insurance associated with new loans commissions from the sales of investment annuity and long term care insurance products and commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance The following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item Table of Contents in thousands Commissions earned from Sales of credit life insurance Sales of investments annuities and long term care insurance Sales of property and casualty insurance Total Noninterest income not considered to be core resulted in a net contribution to total noninterest income of million in million in and million in The components of non core noninterest income are shown in Table and the significant components thereof are discussed below In and we recorded million and million in write downs and losses on foreclosed properties respectively of which million and million related to write downs on covered properties respectively Consistent with the other failed bank accounting adjustments discussed earlier the bottom line impact to pretax income of these write downs on covered properties was of the gross write downs Indemnification asset income for and amounted to million and million respectively with no corresponding amount in This income primarily relates to upward adjustments to the amount expected to be received from the FDIC under loss share agreements as a result of higher than anticipated loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write downs as follows in millions Higher expected FDIC claims for covered loans experiencing a deterioration in quality Lower expected FDIC claims for covered loans related to loan discount accretion and principal paydowns payoffs Foreclosed property losses and write downs covered Total adjustment to expected FDIC loss share claims Expected reimbursement rate Indemnification asset income In and as previously discussed we realized gains from the FDIC assisted acquisitions of failed banks amounting to million and million respectively which were the amounts by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed in each transaction The line item Other gains losses was positively impacted in by the sale of our merchant credit card processing portfolio which resulted in a gain of Noninterest Expenses Noninterest expenses for were million compared to million in and million in Table presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years As reflected in the amounts noted above noninterest expenses increased in and in The increases in noninterest expenses over the past three years have occurred in almost every line item of expense and have been primarily a result of our significant growth Due to acquisition and internal growth over the past three years our number of bank branches has increased from to and the number of full time equivalent employees has increased from at December to at December Additionally from December to December the amount of loans outstanding increased and deposits increased Table of Contents Total personnel expense increased by approximately million or in Salaries expense comprised million of this increase which was primarily a result of an initiative to progressively build our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens collection activities and overall growth of the Company as well as to prepare for future growth Another factor in the increase in salaries expense in was the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January which added approximately employees Higher employee health insurance costs also played a role in the increase in personnel expense in Employee health insurance expense amounted to million in an increase of million over the million incurred in We self insure our employees health care expense therefore incurred health care costs directly impact the expense we record In salaries expense increased million primarily due to a full year of salaries related to employees assumed in the June Cooperative acquisition The increase in salary expense was partially offset by lower health care expenses of million and lower pension expense in of million Pension expense decreased during primarily due to investment gains experienced by the pension plan s assets in In and we incurred acquisition expenses of approximately million in connection with The Bank of Asheville acquisition and million in connection with the Cooperative Bank acquisition respectively Acquisition expenses for both periods consisted primarily of professional fees FDIC deposit insurance expense declined in each of the past two years In and we incurred approximately million million and million respectively in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense The million in FDIC insurance expense for included a special assessment which applied to all banks of million As previously discussed the FDIC changed its premium assessment methodology in April which was favorable for our company and reduced our expense in Due to higher levels of delinquencies and foreclosure activity including those associated with our covered assets we recorded million in repossession and collection expenses net of FDIC reimbursements in compared to million in and million in Within the non credit losses presented in Table we recorded million in in connection with a fraud loss Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was million in million in and million in Table presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates The effective tax rate for was compared to in and in The variances in effective tax rates are primarily due to changes in the proportion of tax exempt interest income to pretax income We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in Stock Based Compensation We recorded stock based compensation expense of million million and million for the years ended December and respectively See Note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock based compensation Table of Contents IN FINANCIAL CONDITION Overview Over the past two years our total assets have decreased from billion at December to billion at December which was primarily due to declines in our outstanding loans and deposits Changes in our loans and deposit balances occur as a result of organic growth or decline as well as acquisitions During the first quarter of we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC assisted failed bank transaction The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in and in thousands Balance at beginning of period Internal growth Growth from Acquisitions Balance at end of period Total percentage growth Internal percentage growth Loans Non covered Loans Covered Total loans Deposits Noninterest bearing Deposits NOW Deposits Money market Deposits Savings Deposits Brokered time Deposits Internet time Deposits Time retail Deposits Time retail Total deposits Loans Non covered Loans Covered Total loans Deposits Noninterest bearing Deposits NOW Deposits Money market Deposits Savings Deposits Brokered time Deposits Internet time Deposits Time retail Deposits Time retail Total deposits Excludes the impact of acquisitions in the year of the acquisition but includes growth or declines in acquired operations after the date of acquisition In as derived from the table above our total loans declined million or Positively impacting loans outstanding was our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville on January which added million in loans However this increase was more than offset by loan payoffs foreclosures and loan charge offs During we charged off million in loans and foreclosed on another million that reduced our loan balances with a portion of the charge off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions Also loan demand in most of our market areas has remained weak with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations In addition we have de emphasized certain types of lending most notably acquisition and development land loans and non owner occupied commercial real estate Table of Contents However for the first time since our loans outstanding began trending downward in we experienced sequential quarterly growth in our non covered loan portfolio during each of the last two quarters of with non covered loans increasing by million during the last half of We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve asset yields as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our SBLF preferred stock see Note to the consolidated financial statements for more information To start our total deposits increased by million as a result of the January acquisition of The Bank of Asheville For the remainder of the year as our loans declined we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding including internet deposits and time deposits which resulted in generally declining deposit balances Our lowest cost deposits noninterest bearing demand accounts and NOW accounts experienced positive internal growth of million and million respectively In addition to our bank wide emphasis to grow these types of low rate accounts the increase in NOW accounts was impacted by million in customer funds that were shifted from repurchase agreements securities sold under agreements to repurchase to NOW accounts during late In July the Dodd Frank Act repealed certain sections of the Federal Reserve Act that prohibited payment of interest on commercial demand deposits With this prohibition removed we began to pay interest on certain types of commercial demand accounts and we encouraged our customers with repurchase agreements to switch to commercial NOW accounts which eliminated the need to sell pledge our investment securities For the same reasons as discussed above for we experienced a decline in loans of in In we also experienced a decline in deposits of with most of the decline occurring in retail time deposits Retail time deposits are generally a high cost source of funds for us and during we decided not to match promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources and consequently we experienced a loss of time deposits Also declining significantly in was our level of internet time deposits Our level of time deposits gathered from internet posting services declined from million at December to million at December Substantially all of our internet deposits during were assumed in the Cooperative acquisition in Prior to its closing Cooperative was prohibited from originating or renewing brokered deposits and accordingly they enhanced liquidity by offering relatively high interest rates on internet posting services As these time deposits have matured the internet depositors mostly credit unions have elected not to renew the time deposits at the interest rates we have proposed In we replaced most of the lost internet deposits with brokered deposits which had more favorable interest rates As a result our brokered deposits increased from million at December to million at December We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds in the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program This program previously provided unlimited FDIC insurance for interest bearing transaction accounts earning interest rates up to Subsequent to this change the only accounts with unlimited FDIC insurance are non interest bearing transaction accounts Our overall liquidity increased slightly during compared to We experienced a million increase in deposits while loans decreased million With the excess deposits we were able to reduce our borrowings by approximately million during Our liquid assets cash and securities as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from at December to at December Our capital ratios improved in All of our capital ratios have continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for well capitalized status for all periods covered by this report Table of Contents Due to the continued economic slowdown our asset quality ratios remain at unfavorable levels compared to most of our company s history Our non covered nonperforming assets to total non covered assets ratio was at December compared to at December and at December For the year ended December our ratio of net non covered charge offs to average non covered loans was compared to for and for Distribution of Assets and Liabilities Table sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December and Our balance sheet distribution has remained relatively stable over the past three years The increase in NOW deposits discussed earlier resulted in an increase in this category from of total liabilities and shareholders equity at December to in Also over the past two years we have experienced a decline in retail time deposits less than other time deposits that has resulted in other time deposits declining from of total liabilities and shareholders equity in to in Securities Information regarding our securities portfolio as of December and is presented in Tables and The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds furnishing liquidity and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits We obtain fair values for the vast majority of our investment securities from a third party investment recordkeeper who specializes in securities purchases and sales recordkeeping and valuation This recordkeeper provides us with a third party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third party valuation service on a quarterly basis Total securities amounted to million million and million at December and respectively The majority of our government sponsored enterprise securities are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank and carry one maturity date often with an issuer call feature At December of the million carrying value in government sponsored enterprise securities million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system Our million of mortgage backed securities have all been issued by either Freddie Mac Fannie Mae Ginnie Mae or the Small Business Administration each of which are government sponsored corporations We have no private label mortgage backed securities Mortgage backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans Included in mortgage backed securities at December were collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs with an amortized cost of million and a fair value of million The CMOs that we have invested in are substantially all early tranche portions of the CMOs which minimizes our long term interest rate risk Table of Contents At December our million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following in thousands S P

Security BB First Citizens Bancorp North Carolina Trust Preferred Security BB First Citizens Bancorp South Carolina Trust Preferred Security Not Rated Total investment in corporate bonds The ratings are as of January Substantially all of our investment in equity securities at each year end was comprised of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta FHLB The FHLB requires us to purchase their stock in order to borrow from them The amount they require us to invest is based on our level of borrowings from them At December our investment in capital stock of the FHLB amounted to million of our total investment in equity securities of million Until February the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as borrowings were repaid On February the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when loans are repaid Instead they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis During and the FHLB repurchased million and million respectively of their stock from the Company The fair value of securities held to maturity which we carry at amortized cost was more than the carrying value at December and less than the carrying value at December Our million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout our market area We have only two municipal bonds with a denomination greater than and we have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity with the single largest exposure to any one entity being Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations At December and a net unrealized gain of and respectively was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale During the past three years interest rates have generally declined which typically increases the value of our investment securities Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities

corporations in thousands Issuer Amortized Cost Fair Value of Shareholders Equity Ginnie Mae Small Business Administration Total Loans Table provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends As previously discussed in our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC which afford us significant protection from losses on all loans and other real estate acquired in those acquisitions Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC the financial risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans is significantly different from assets not covered under the loss share agreements Accordingly we present separately loans subject to the FDIC loss share agreements as covered loans and loans that are not subject to the loss share agreements as non covered loans Table a presents a breakout of covered and non covered loans as of December The loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans real estate mortgage loans real estate construction loans and consumer loans We restrict virtually all of our lending to our county market area which is located in western central and eastern North Carolina four counties in southern Virginia and five counties in northeastern South Carolina The diversity of the region s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment In loans outstanding decreased million or to billion In loans outstanding decreased million or to billion As previously discussed the declines for both years were mainly due to loan payoffs and loan foreclosures exceeding new loan growth as loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak The majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising to of our outstanding loan balances Except for real estate construction land development and other land loans the majority of our real estate loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower s occupation or business is the primary repayment source with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source Table indicates that the two types of loans that have had the largest variances in the amount outstanding as a percent of total loans have been construction land development loans and residential mortgage loans In we expanded our branch network to what was then the fast growing southeast coast of North Carolina which had a high demand for construction and land development loans In due to recessionary conditions particularly in the new housing market loan demand for these types of loans weakened and we tightened our loan underwriting criteria for these types of loans which reduced growth Due to economic conditions for the past three years we have made very few new acquisition and land development loans and we expect this trend to continue Table of Contents Our concentration of residential mortgage loans increased in as a result of the Cooperative acquisition because Cooperative s loan portfolio was heavily concentrated in residential mortgages In due to The Bank of Asheville acquisition our percentage of commercial real estate loans increased slightly as that bank s primary business had been commercial lending Table provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately Approximately of our accruing loans outstanding at December mature within one year and of total loans mature within five years As of December the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were and respectively We intentionally make a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans troubled debt restructurings loans past due or more days and still accruing interest and other real estate As a matter of policy we place all loans that are past due or more days on nonaccrual basis and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were days past due and still accruing interest Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because i interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income ii future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and iii principal charged off if appropriate may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings In some cases where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms Table summarizes our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC we present separately nonperforming assets subject to the loss share agreements as covered and nonperforming assets that are not subject to the loss share agreements as non covered Due largely to the economic downturn that began in late and continued to worsen over the past few years we have experienced increases in our non covered nonperforming assets Our total nonperforming assets were also significantly impacted by the Cooperative acquisition in Table a presents our nonperforming assets at December by general geographic region and further segregated into covered nonperforming assets and non covered nonperforming assets The majority of our nonperforming assets are located in the Eastern North Carolina region which has experienced the most negative effects of the recession of any of our regions Non covered nonperforming loans totaled million million and million as of December and respectively Total non covered nonperforming loans as a percentage of total non covered loans amounted to and at December and respectively At December and non covered troubled debt restructurings amounted to million million and million respectively The decline in is primarily a result of troubled debt restructurings that re defaulted and were placed on nonaccrual status The increase in was the result of our initiative to work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by modifying certain loan terms Table of Contents We also had million and million of covered troubled debt restructurings at December and respectively compared to none in The following is the composition by loan type of all of our nonaccrual loans at each period end as classified for regulatory purposes in thousands At December At December Commercial financial and agricultural Real estate construction land development and other land loans Real estate mortgage residential family first mortgages Real estate mortgage home equity loans lines of credit Real estate mortgage commercial and other Installment loans to individuals Total nonaccrual loans Includes both covered and non covered loans The following segregates our nonaccrual loans at December into covered and non covered loans as classified for regulatory purposes in thousands Covered Nonaccrual Loans Non covered Nonaccrual Loans Total Nonaccrual Loans Commercial financial and agricultural Real estate construction land development and other land loans Real estate mortgage residential family first mortgages Real estate mortgage home equity loans

land development and other land loans Real estate mortgage residential family first mortgages Real estate mortgage home equity loans lines of credit Real estate mortgage commercial and other Installment loans to individuals Total nonaccrual loans The tables above indicate that covered nonaccrual loans declined from million at December to million at December This decrease was primarily a result of many of the nonaccrual loans at December being either charged off or being foreclosed upon in and their balances being transferred to other real estate during the year Non covered nonaccrual loans increased from million at December to million at December which was the result of continued economic hardship in our market areas particularly for the commercial real estate business Table of Contents If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December and had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period gross interest income in the amounts of approximately and for nonaccrual loans and and for restructured loans would have been recorded for and respectively Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in and amounted to approximately and for nonaccrual loans prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status and and for restructured loans respectively At December and we had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming Management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that in management s opinion have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans In addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above management believes that an estimated million of non covered loans and million of covered loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December see discussion below Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss doubtful substandard or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results liquidity or capital resources or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms Other real estate includes foreclosed repossessed and idled properties Non covered other real estate has increased over the past three years amounting to million at December million at December and million at December At December and we also held million million and million respectively in other real estate that is subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC We believe that the fair values of the items of other real estate less estimated costs to sell equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented The following table presents the detail of our other real estate at each of the past two year ends At December At December Vacant land family residential properties Commercial real estate Other Total other real estate Includes both covered and non covered real estate Table of Contents The following segregates our other real estate at December into covered and non covered Covered Other Real Estate Non covered Other Real Estate Total Other

Covered Other Real Estate Non covered Other Real Estate Total Other Real Estate Vacant land family residential properties Commercial real estate Other Total other real estate Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience The allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations known as a provision for loan losses for the period in which the charge is taken Losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans in management s opinion become uncollectible The recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance We consider our procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy See the heading Critical Accounting Policies above for further discussion The factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience composition of the loan portfolio evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions We use a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses In this program credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an independent third party consulting firm The testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses loans past due days or more loans originated by new loan officers nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations We strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market areas Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies We have no foreign loans few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as real estate loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan Collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within our principal market area The allowance for loan losses amounted to million at December compared to million at December and million at December At December and million and million respectively of the allowance for loan losses is attributable to covered loans that have exhibited credit quality deterioration due to lower collateral valuations while the allowance for loan losses for non covered loans amounted to million and million at those dates For all prior periods the entire allowance for loan losses is attributable to non covered loans Table of Contents The ratio of the allowance for non covered loan losses to non covered loans was and as of December and respectively The decrease in the percentage for is primarily attributable to lower specific reserves at December The increased allowance percentage in was necessary due to the higher level of delinquencies and classified and nonperforming loans Table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated The amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories Table a segregates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December and into covered and non covered categories As indicated in Tables and a the amount of the allowance allocated to Real Estate Construction and Land Development declined by million from December to December This decline was due to charge offs and the foreclosure and transfer to other real estate of a significant amount of covered land development loans Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date It must be emphasized however that the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio in light of conditions and factors then prevailing will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings In addition various regulatory agencies as an integral part of their examination process periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations For the years indicated Table summarizes our balances of loans outstanding average loans outstanding and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses Table a presents a detailed rollforward of the and activity for the allowance for loan losses segregated into covered and non covered activity Net loan charge offs of non covered loans amounted to million in million in and million in The elevated amounts in and reflect the impact of deteriorating loan quality that has been impacted by the economic downturn Also in and we recorded million and million respectively in partial charge offs of non covered loans Previously we recorded specific reserves on collateral deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loans losses but did not record charge offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon Net non covered charge offs as a percentage of average non covered loans represented and during and respectively We recorded million and million in charge offs of covered loans during and respectively primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals that reflected lower valuations Table of Contents Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase At December deposits outstanding amounted to billion an increase of million from December To begin deposits initially grew by million as a result of the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January For the remainder of the year our deposit base declined by million as a lack of loan growth allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits Our NOW deposits increased approximately million during with million being assumed in The Bank of Asheville acquisition and another million of the growth resulting from customers shifting their funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to a commercial interest bearing NOW account discussed earlier In despite the addition of million in time deposits and million in internet deposits from The Bank of Asheville acquisition we experienced overall net declines in these categories of million and million respectively due to our ability to lessen our reliance on these higher cost deposits as a result of weak loan demand and growth in our other lower cost deposit categories In deposits declined from billion to billion a decrease of million or from December Approximately million or of the decline in deposits was attributable to decreases in time deposits We also experienced a million decrease in our NOW accounts during primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds during the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program The nature of our deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends Noninterest bearing deposits NOW deposits Money market deposits Savings deposits Brokered deposits Internet deposits Time deposits retail Time deposits retail Total deposits Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a percent of total deposits The deposit mix remained relatively consistent from to Our mix has gradually shifted over the past few years to a heavier concentration in transaction accounts and less concentration in our time deposits The percentages for retail time deposits have declined because we have chosen not to match certain promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources Our growth in other categories of deposits and our weak loan demand eliminated the need to match the higher competitor rates We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits such as emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and or retain deposits and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services Table presents the average amounts of our deposits and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December and Table of Contents As of December we held approximately million in time deposits of or more Table is a maturity schedule of time deposits of or more as of December This table shows that of our time deposits greater than mature within one year At each of the past three year ends we have no deposits issued through foreign offices nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors Borrowings We had borrowings outstanding of million at December compared to million at December and million at December Borrowings decreased from to primarily as a result of a decline in loans and growth in deposits that provided funds to pay down our borrowings During most of we held a lower level of borrowings until late in the year when we obtained borrowings to offset a portion of the liquidity decline we experienced as a result of the loss of deposits that was previously discussed Table shows that average borrowings were million in compared to million in and million in At December the Company had four sources of readily available borrowing capacity an approximately million line of credit with the FHLB of which million was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank of which none was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December an approximately million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond s FRB discount window of which none was outstanding at December and million was outstanding at December and a million holding company line of credit with a commercial bank none of which was outstanding at December or Our line of credit with the FHLB can be structured as either short term or long term borrowings depending on the particular funding or liquidity need and is secured by our FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio As of December none of the million outstanding with the FHLB were overnight borrowings All the FHLB borrowings were at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and maturity dates ranging from April to June For the year ended December the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of The maximum amount of short term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month end during was million In addition to the outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit our borrowing capacity was further reduced by million at December and as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each of those dates Our correspondent bank relationship allows us to purchase up to million in federal funds on an overnight unsecured basis federal funds purchased We had no borrowings under this line at December We had million outstanding under this line at December with a weighted average interest rate of There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month end during We also have a line of credit with the FRB discount window This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio excluding real estate loans Based on the collateral that we owned as of December the available line of credit was approximately million At December we had no borrowings outstanding under this line At December we had million in borrowings outstanding under this line There were no FRB borrowings outstanding at any month end during Table of Contents At December and we had a million holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by of the common stock of our bank subsidiary This line of credit expires and is subject to renewal in March of each year The line of credit had no outstanding balance at December or and was not drawn upon during or In addition to the lines of credit described above in which we had million and million outstanding as of December and respectively we also had a total of million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at December and We have initiated three trust preferred security issuances since totaling million with one of those issuances for million being redeemed in These borrowings each have year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date We issued million of this debt on October which we called in an additional million on December and million on April The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three month LIBOR plus for the securities issued in and three month LIBOR plus for the securities issued in Liquidity Commitments and Contingencies We have a pending agreement to purchase eleven branches of another bank with approximately million in total deposits and million in total loans See Note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds and our ability to maintain required reserve levels pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations cash and due from banks federal funds sold and other short term investments Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash As noted above in addition to internally generated liquidity sources we currently March have the ability to obtain borrowings from the following four sources an approximately million line of credit with the FHLB a million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank an approximately million line of credit through the FRB s discount window and a holding company line of credit with a limit of million Our overall liquidity increased slightly during compared to Our loans decreased by million while our deposits increased by million As a result our liquid assets cash and securities as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from at December to at December We continue to believe our liquidity sources including unused lines of credit are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate In the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows In addition there are commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit that may or may not require future cash outflows Table reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December Any of our million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances including material adverse changes in our condition or if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement Table of Contents In the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit which are not reflected in the financial statements The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December in millions Type of Commitment Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Outstanding closed end loan commitments Unfunded commitments on revolving lines of credit credit cards and home equity loans Total At December and we also had million and million respectively in standby letters of credit outstanding We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a guarantee made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier The maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit a note already executed by the customer becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral Over the past two years we have had to honor only a few standby letters of credit which involved insignificant amounts of funds and have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any loss to us We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits thus not requiring any net cash outflow Based on that assumption management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations We are not involved in any legal proceedings that in management s opinion could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company Capital Resources and Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity at December amounted to million compared to million at December The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders equity are net income which increases shareholders equity and dividends declared which decreases shareholders equity Additionally any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders equity In the most significant factors that impacted our equity were the redemption of million of our Series A Preferred Stock issued under the U S Treasury s Capital Purchase Program also known as TARP and the simultaneous issuance of million of Series B Preferred Stock under the Treasury s Small Business Lending Fund SBLF Net income of million for increased equity while common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million reduced equity We also recorded accretion of the discount on preferred stock of million due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock See Note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions Another significant factor negatively impacting equity in was a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss that was caused by an increase in our pension liability The increase in the pension liability was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on the actuarial calculations involved in determining the liability Our policy is to use the Citigroup Pension Index yield curve in the computation of the pension liability At December that index had a weighted average rate of which was a decline from the rate of at December See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders equity Table of Contents In the most significant factors that impacted our equity were net income of million which increased equity and common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million which reduced equity See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders equity In the most significant item that impacted our equity was our issuance of million in preferred stock to the U S Treasury in connection with our participation in the Treasury s Capital Purchase Program see Note to the consolidated financial statements In addition other significant factors were net income of million which increased equity and common stock dividends declared of million and preferred stock dividends declared of million which reduced equity See the consolidated financial statements for other less significant factors that impacted equity in We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which if they were to be implemented would have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources or operations The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of Tier capital to total risk weighted assets Tier I Capital Ratio and total capital to risk weighted assets Total Capital Ratio of and respectively Tier capital is comprised of total shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale less intangible assets and total capital is comprised of Tier capital plus certain adjustments the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses Risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in FRB and FDIC regulations In addition to the risk based capital requirements described above the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier capital as defined above to quarterly average total assets Leverage Ratio of to depending upon the institution s composite ratings as determined by its regulators The FRB has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to the Company Table presents our regulatory capital ratios as of December and All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank s classification as well capitalized The specific guidelines are as follows Tier I Capital Ratio of at least Total Capital Ratio of at least and a Leverage Ratio of at least If a bank falls below well capitalized status in any of these three ratios it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits The Bank s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for well capitalized status at December and see Note to the consolidated financial statements for a table that presents the Bank s regulatory ratios Table of Contents In addition to shareholders equity we have supplemented our capital in past years with trust preferred security debt issuances which because of their structure qualify as regulatory capital This was necessary in past years because our balance sheet growth outpaced the growth rate of our capital Additionally we have frequently purchased bank branches over the years that resulted in our recording intangible assets which negatively impacted regulatory capital ratios As discussed in Borrowings above we have issued a total of million in trust preferred securities since with the most recent issuance being a million issuance that occurred in April We currently have million in trust preferred securities outstanding In this economic environment our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least basis points higher than the well capitalized thresholds set for banks At December our total risk based capital ratio was compared to the well capitalized threshold In addition to regulatory capital ratios we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets TCE Ratio Our TCE ratio was at December compared to at December See Supervision and Regulation under Business above and Note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect our capital resources Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments Off balance sheet arrangements include transactions agreements or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity We have no off balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities Derivative financial instruments include futures forwards interest rate swaps options contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics We have not engaged in derivatives activities through December and have no current plans to do so Return on Assets and Equity Table shows return on assets net income available to common shareholders divided by average total assets return on common equity net income available to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity dividend payout ratio dividends per share divided by net income per common share and shareholders equity to assets ratio average total shareholders equity divided by average total assets for each of the years in the three year period ended December Interest Rate Risk Including Quantitative Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings Notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits our level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to our various categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities It is our policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection to the extent practical against wide interest rate fluctuations Our exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard GAP reports maturity reports and an asset liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates expected future interest rates and various intervals of shock interest rates Over the years we have been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets net interest margin Over the past five calendar years our net interest margin has ranged from a low of realized in to a high of realized in During that five year period the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of which was the rate as of December to a high of The consistency of the net interest margin is aided by the relatively low level of long term interest rate exposure that we maintain At December approximately of our interest earning assets are subject to repricing within five years because they are either adjustable rate assets or they are fixed rate assets that mature and substantially all of our interest bearing liabilities reprice within five years Table of Contents Table sets forth our interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December using stated maturities for all fixed rate instruments except mortgage backed securities which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called which are shown in the period of their expected call As illustrated by this table at December we had million more in interest bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets This generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment However this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings market value or management actions Also interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates In addition to the effects of when various rate sensitive products reprice market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products For example included in interest bearing liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at December are deposits totaling billion comprised of NOW savings and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management These types of deposits historically have not repriced with or in the same proportion as general market indicators Overall we believe that in the near term twelve months net interest income will not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates Similarly we would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates Generally when rates change our interest sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change while our interest sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change In the short term less than six months this results in us being asset sensitive meaning that our net interest income benefits from an increase in interest rates and is negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates However in the twelve month horizon the impact of having a higher level of interest sensitive liabilities lessens the short term effects of changes in interest rates The Federal Reserve has made no changes to interest rates since and since that time the difference between market driven short term interest rates and longer term interest rates has generally widened with short term interest rates steadily declining and longer term interest rates not declining by as much The higher long term interest rate environment enhanced our ability to require higher interest rates on loans As it relates to funding we have been able to reprice many of our maturing time deposits at lower interest rates We were also able to generally decrease the rates we paid on other categories of deposits as a result of declining short term interest rates in the marketplace and an increase in liquidity that lessened our need to offer premium interest rates Our net interest margin increased throughout and Our net interest margin was for a basis point increase from the margin realized in As previously discussed in the section Net Interest Income our net interest income was impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments related primarily to our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville The purchase accounting adjustments related to the premium amortization on loans deposits and borrowings are based on amortization schedules and are thus systematic and predictable The accretion of the loan discount on loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville which amounted to million and million for and respectively is less predictable and could be materially different among periods This is because of the magnitude of the discounts that were initially recorded million in total and the fact that the accretion being recorded is dependent on both the credit quality of the acquired loans and the impact of any accelerated loan repayments including payoffs If the credit quality of the loans declines some or all of the remaining discount will cease to be accreted into income If the underlying loans experience accelerated paydowns or are paid off the remaining discount will be accreted into income on an accelerated basis which in the event of total payoff will result in the remaining discount being entirely accreted into income in the period of the payoff Each of these factors is difficult to predict and susceptible to volatility Table of Contents Based on our most recent interest rate modeling which assumes no changes in interest rates for federal funds rate prime we project that our net interest margin for will remain relatively consistent with the net interest margins recently realized With interest rates having been stable for a relatively long period of time most of our interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities have been repriced at rates near today s interest rates We have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes nor do we maintain any foreign currency positions Table presents the expected maturities of our other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments Table also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with relevant accounting guidance Our assets and liabilities have estimated fair values that do not materially differ from their carrying amounts See additional discussion regarding net interest income as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin in the section entitled Net Interest Income above Inflation Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature payable in fixed determinable amounts the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories During periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets loans and deposits Also general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses Current Accounting Matters We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by among others the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic the FASB frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply

ended December The following MD A concerning our operations is intended to satisfy three principal objectives Provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to see the company through the eyes of management Enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which our financial information should be analyzed and Provide information about the quality of and potential variability of our earnings and cash flow so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance Management s discussion and analysis like other portions of this Annual Report on Form K includes forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance However our anticipated future financial performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward looking statements A cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements is set forth under the caption Forward Looking Statements in Item A of this Annual Report on Form K This discussion and analysis should be considered in light of that cautionary statement This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes tables and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report All figures are in thousands except per share data and per employee data Table of Contents EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW Results of Operations Earnings reached a record high of per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of an increase of per share During higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income or while credit and foreclosure costs remained historically high at compared to during Noninterest and fee income during was largely unchanged compared to while operating expenses excluding loss on foreclosed assets declined or from lower FDIC insurance premium expense and lower debit card losses following a significant fraud loss during During total nonperforming assets increased or due to a increase in troubled debt that has been restructured but continues to pay according to its restructured terms However nonaccrual assets decreased or and foreclosed assets decreased or during Total nonperforming assets were or of total assets as of December compared or of total assets as of December During we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin While interest rates are not expected to change significantly during an initial period of rising interest rates should be expected to reduce net interest margin and potentially net interest income as funding costs increase with rising rates but floating rate loan yields remain at their floors for a time In addition a falling rate environment would lower loan yields to a greater extent than further deposit price reductions pressuring net interest margin and income During credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write down of foreclosed asset values compared to However we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned Due to stabilization of historically low long term interest rates on residential mortgages we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during In addition regulatory changes effective during for overdraft fee income and in for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs Taken together net income growth during is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during and Earnings were per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of During higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income or while income also benefited from a or decline in credit and foreclosure losses compared to Net interest income increased primarily from maintenance of interest rate floors on adjustable rate loans while deposit costs continued to fall Offsetting this increase to income was decreased noninterest and fee income down during or primarily from recognition of a gain on sale of securities Operating expenses increased or and included increased salaries and employee benefits of up and higher all other operating expenses excluding foreclosure costs of or Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily from an annual increase in base pay fewer deferred loan origination costs and increased year end incentive and profit sharing expense based on net income levels achieved Earnings were per share in on net income of compared to earnings of per share in on net income of However both years experienced nonrecurring items related to sale of securities and disposal of premises and equipment Pro forma net income before these special items was in and in a net income decline of during The decline was due to significantly higher provision for loan losses loss on sale of foreclosed assets and higher FDIC insurance expense Offsetting a portion of these increased expenses during were increases in net interest income from higher net interest margin and record levels of mortgage banking income Each of these factors was influenced by falling market interest rates occurring during the national recession then in effect Liquidity Total assets increased or less than to at December compared to at December While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased or Total net loans receivable increased or to at December Offsetting this increase in assets was a decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets Asset growth during is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt Core deposits increased during from a increase in year end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in Increased deposits were used to repay of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year end Wholesale borrowings including brokered and national deposits FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements increased during Wholesale borrowings were at December compared to at December Our most significant sources of liquidity and wholesale funding include federal funds purchased from correspondent banks FHLB advances brokered and national certificates of deposit and Federal Discount Window advances In addition to the federal funds sold position of we have of unused funding available at December which is considered adequate to meet customer operational and growth needs during Most of our wholesale funding sources require either pledging of assets maintenance of well capitalized regulatory status or additional purchases of FHLB capital stock or all of these items to continue or expand participation in the funding program In particular of potential FHLB advance funding considered available at December would require additional purchase of up to of their capital stock which pays a nominal dividend and for which no trading market exists Table of Contents Due in part to an expected reduction to future debit card income in response to Dodd Frank legislation and a qualifying account structure which required payment of a significantly greater than market rate of interest we discontinued sale of our Rewards Checking product during Rewards Checking was a retail high yield interest bearing checking account with account usage qualifications to earn the premium interest rate Qualifications included receipt of the monthly account statement via email at least debit card purchases per month and at least electronic transfer per month During Rewards Checking paid qualifying accounts a annual percentage yield on the first of balance and reimbursed customer ATM fees Since its introduction during Rewards Checking had been our primary source of retail deposit growth Absence of the Reward Checking product from our retail deposit product line could negatively impact future deposit growth Total assets increased or at December compared to December The majority of the increase was in cash and cash equivalents up as core deposits increased or The core deposit increase in was driven by a increase in our Rewards Checking high yielding NOW account and a large commercial money market account opened during by a related party A decline in net loans receivable of or primarily from lower commercial related loans was offset by increased investment securities and purchased bank certificates of deposit totaling up An increase in other borrowings and stockholders equity of along with the increase in deposits previously mentioned contributed to a reduction in wholesale deposits and FHLB advances of during Brokered deposits FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements were at December down or from at December Capital Resources We are considered well capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of at December compared to at December and at December Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of to be considered well capitalized During regulatory capital increased from higher retained earnings up over earnings retained during while risk adjusted assets increased just During total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to risk weighting rather than the risk weighting assigned in prior years In addition we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio These changes along with retained net income increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than On a book basis total tangible common equity reflected on the December Consolidated Balance Sheets was compared to at December and at December In response to Dodd Frank legislation banking regulatory agencies are expected to announce higher minimum capital standards for banks to be considered well capitalized during We issued of senior subordinated notes during which may be repaid in full during at our option and mature in Approximately of our total regulatory capital is comprised of debt instruments including junior and senior debentures and notes which unlike common stock require quarterly payments of interest Therefore although no current plans exist future capital needs during the next several years would likely be met by issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock as needed We expect to continue to pay our traditional semi annual cash dividend assuming continued profitable operations and projections of adequate future capital levels for growth and credit risk In addition any future growth through merger and acquisition activities should be expected to drain excess capital levels and could increase the likelihood of a new common or preferred stock capital raise potentially diluting existing stockholders Several years of low asset growth and high earnings levels have raised book and regulatory capital ratios to historically high levels For example our total regulatory capital ratio has increased from at December to at December Due to projected low levels of organic loan growth available in our existing markets and expectations for improving problem loan trends we are evaluating actions which could utilize excess capital to build shareholder value Our primary focus is on market and core deposit expansion via merger and acquisition of other banks with relatively low credit risk profiles and near our current markets If value added merger and acquisition options do not materialize in the near term we may consider repayment of our existing senior subordinated notes or resumption of our traditional stock repurchase program on the open market Such actions would decrease existing capital ratios but would be expected to increase net income or net book value per share Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Our largest volume off balance sheet activity involves our servicing of payments and related collection activities on approximately million of residential to family mortgages sold to FHLB and FNMA up million from million at December Serviced mortgage loans increased from customer refinance activity a trend which began during when serviced loans increased million or and continued with serviced loans increasing million or during As expected we experienced significantly slower growth during and we may not see significant organic growth in serviced loans in future years Proposals by the U S Treasury concerning FNMA and the FHLB could reduce the amount of annual servicing income currently of serviced mortgage balances annually paid to us to service future mortgages originated and sold to them Table of Contents We have provided a credit enhancement against FHLB loss on approximately of the serviced principal up to a maximum guarantee of million in the aggregate However we would incur such loss only if the FHLB first lost million on this loan pool of approximately million No sold loans have received our credit enhancement guarantee of principal since October and we have no intentions of originating future loans with the guarantee Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in only million of million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations During we experienced a loss from repurchase of a foreclosed loan with underwriting violations related to private mortgage insurance We reviewed our remaining portfolio of loans with similar origination circumstances and do not have a material exposure to future loss for loans underwritten in the same manner Absent this loss we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since and have not been required to repurchase any other loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expected to be required to repurchase loans in the near term We provide various commitments to extend credit for both commercial and consumer purposes totaling approximately million at December compared to million at December These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon Our primary long term contractual obligations are related to repayment of funding sources such as FHLB advances long term other borrowings and customer time deposits which make up of our total long term contractual obligations For all contractual obligations outstanding at December will require repayment or refinancing during although virtually of these obligations represent time deposits taken in the normal course of business During we originated a program to offer certain high credit quality customers fixed interest rate swaps to hedge their risk on variable rate commercial real estate loans with us Fixed interest rate swaps sold to customers in which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate are simultaneously offset by our purchase of a variable interest rate swap from a correspondent bank in which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate Such swap sale programs are often referred to back to back interest rate swaps as the resulting fixed interest rate risk with our customer is offset by our variable rate risk with our counterparty At December there were in back to back swaps outstanding with variable rate commercial real estate loan customers RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Table of Item of this Annual Report on Form K presents various financial performance ratios and measures for each of the five years in the period ended December A number of separate or nonrecurring factors impacted our earnings during through but none have had a significant impact to net income during and Table presents our net income for each of the five years in the period ended December before certain tax adjusted nonrecurring income and expense items

during were or per diluted share compared to or per diluted share during an increase of per share up net income increased over the prior year due to increased net interest income of up due to a slight increase in net margin and average earning assets Credit costs totaled during a slight decline of or compared to primarily from lower provision for loan losses while loss on foreclosed assets

down of foreclosed asset values compared to However we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned Due to stabilization of historically low long term interest rates on residential mortgages we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during In addition regulatory changes effective during for overdraft fee income and during for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during We expect noninterest income to be less than due to these factors Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs Taken together net income growth during is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during and compared to Earnings reached a then record high of per share during an increase of over earnings of per share Increased earnings were led by higher net interest income of up from increased net interest margin and significantly lower credit and foreclosure costs down from earnings also benefited from continued high levels of mortgage banking refinance income which although less than in continued at historically high levels Service fees increased or from changes to our customer courtesy overdraft program during which recognized increased customer overdraft activity These increases to income were offset by higher salaries and employee benefits up from several factors including an annual increase in base wages lower deferral of direct loan origination expenses and higher year end incentive costs from meeting income growth goals Data processing costs increased or due in part to conversion to a new service bureau data processing system and related training and implementation costs Because the initial data processing contract called for reduced fees during the initial implementation period data processing fees are expected to increase significantly during Return on average assets was and during and respectively Return on average stockholders equity was and during and respectively compared to Earnings were per share during on net income of which declined from earnings of per share on net income of However earnings per share before special or nonrecurring items were in on pro forma net income of compared to in on pro forma net income of a decline of or The net decline in was due primarily to significantly greater credit related costs including combined provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed assets expense of during compared to in an increase of over These increased credit costs reduced net income by approximately after income tax benefits compared to During a national economic recession that began during reduced borrower ability to repay loans due to us increasing current net charge offs during as well as our expectation of future charge offs from existing economic factors in effect at that time The majority of the loss on foreclosed assets was a loss on a large land development foreclosure taken to auction during In addition to credit losses FDIC insurance expense premiums increased from in to in as Deposit Insurance Fund DIF reserves declined from payouts to certain depositors of failed banks in the United States FDIC insured banks as an industry were required to pay increased quarterly premiums as well as a special assessment to recapitalize the DIF Increased FDIC insurance expense lowered net income by approximately after tax benefits compared to Offsetting these increased expenses tax adjusted net interest income and mortgage banking income increased during compared to due to falling market interest rates caused by the economic recession The low interest rate environment prompted customers to refinance residential mortgages with us which we subsequently sold on the secondary market We also increased net interest income as very low short term interest rates were used to fund moderately longer dated and higher yielding loans and securities including adjustable rate loans with interest rate floors These factors increased net income by approximately after tax expense Table of Contents Return on average assets was and during and respectively Return on average stockholders equity was and during and respectively Excluding the FNMA preferred stock write down return on average assets would have been during and return on average equity would have been Balance Sheet Changes and Analysis Summary balance sheets at December for each of the five years in the period ended December are presented in Table of Item to this Annual Report on Form K Total assets increased or during the year ended December after increasing during the year ended December and increasing during the year ended December The asset growth

to at December an increase of or The majority of the increase was reflected in increased cash and cash equivalents up or during Commercial related loans declined as locally owned small and medium sized business credit demand declined and we continued to work out of existing problem credits Offsetting the decline in loan balances were increased investment securities and purchased certificates of deposit which increased or and an increase in residential mortgage lending up or Table of Contents Core deposits increased or during although increases in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of offset a decline in local certificates of deposit The combination of low customer loan demand and unusually high local competitor certificate of deposit pricing lessoned our demand for local certificate of deposit funding and contributed to the decline in balances At December money market funding included from a new account relationship obtained during the year from a related party In addition to the increase in local deposits overnight repurchase agreement funding from local customers reflected as other borrowings increased or during from acquisition of a new account relationship totaling at December These two large commercial relationships totaling at December were seasonal and declined significantly during Increased local deposits were used to repay wholesale deposits and FHLB advances during which declined or All wholesale funding including brokered deposits FHLB advances and wholesale other borrowings declined or to during compared to at December Wholesale funding to total assets was and at December and respectively Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans securities and other interest earning assets and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them Interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income Additionally net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates contractual maturities and repricing frequencies Net interest income is our most significant item of revenue generated by operations Table presents changes in the mix of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three years ending December In general net interest income earned on loans funded by savings and demand deposits is greater than that earned on securities funded by time deposits Therefore a balance sheet that contains a growing allocation of loans funded by a growing allocation of savings and demand deposits would normally provide greater net interest income than a growing allocation of securities funded by a growing allocation of time deposits Table Mix of Average Interest Earning Assets and Average Interest Bearing Liabilities Year ending December Loans Taxable

during compared to in an increase of or from a increase in average earning assets during and a slight increase in net margin from in to in Compared to loan yield declined from to basis points while the tax adjusted investment security yield declined from to basis points Continued low overall interest rate levels and very low investment security reinvestment rates caused yield on earning assets to decline as did the cost of paying liabilities which declined from to basis points The market rate decline experienced in the national economy during the recession continues and loans securities and funding continue to reprice lower to current rate levels Average nonaccrual loans totaled during compared to during Based on the average loan yield during the decrease in nonaccrual loans during increased net interest margin by approximately basis points during compared to During cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately basis points Average earning assets grew or during driven by a increase in taxable securities primarily mortgage related investment securities Average interest bearing liabilities decreased or during The primary funding source

average product balances to continue to increase during Average Rewards Checking balances were during compared to in an increase of or Average Rewards Checking balances had increased or during after growing or during Since the account changes product balances have declined slightly and were at December Table of Contents We have increased net interest margin since by inserting interest rate floors in commercial related loans and retail residential home equity lines of credit to avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin from a sustained low interest rate environment and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate At December approximately of our million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors virtually carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate approximately of principal have in the money loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between basis points and basis points If current interest rate levels were assumed to remain the same the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin would be approximately and respectively based on those existing loan floors and average total earning assets during the year ended December During a period of rising short term interest rates we expect average funding costs which are not currently subject to contractual caps on the interest rate to rise while the yield on loans with interest rate floors would remain the same until those loans adjustable rate index caused coupon rates to exceed the loan rate floor The speed in which short term interest rates increase is expected to have a significant impact on net interest income from loans with interest rate floors Quickly rising short term rates would allow adjustable rate loans with floors to reprice to rates higher than the existing floor more quickly impacting net interest income less adversely than if short term rates rose slowly or deliberately Because a future increase in short term funding rates could cause a mismatch between floating rate loan yields and short term funding costs due to existing interest rate floors such positions are modeled and reviewed as part of our asset liability management strategy each quarter Current interest rate simulations based on more extreme rate scenarios such as short term rates up basis points combined with a flattening of the yield curve during a month period could reduce net interest income by to to after tax impacts per year during the first three years of the rate increase We seek to minimize this interest rate risk exposure in part by maintaining the fixed rate period of wholesale funding typically longer than the average term for local deposit funding Wholesale funding is approximately of total assets and carried an approximately month fixed rate term as of December Reinvestment yields for investment security cash flows remain very low and our securities portfolio yield is expected to continue to decline throughout as cash flows are reinvested in this low rate environment In addition loan yields are expected to decline slightly due to competitive pressures as banks seek to increase loan originations while quality credit demand remains weak These declines in earning asset rates are expected to be only partially offset by further declines in certificate of deposit funding costs and nonmaturity deposit costs with net interest margin anticipated to continue in a range of to during During the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act repealed the prohibition on paying interest on commercial checking accounts We currently provide an earnings credit against account fees in lieu of an interest payment and do not expect costs to increase because of this change in the short term Despite the law change we do not sell or promote an interest bearing commercial checking account at this time However the change could have greater long term implications as competitor banks begin to use premium interest rate levels on commercial deposits in attempts to raise deposits in coming years Also during President Obama s administration announced changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program HARP a program first initiated in March The original program was intended to allow homeowners to refinance their mortgages if they were current on payments and owed between and the value of their homes Because a limited number of borrowers took advantage of the plan HARP has now been expanded to allow current borrowers to refinance their mortgage no matter how far the mortgage exceeds the home value This change could impact the speed of prepayments experienced by investors such as us who hold mortgage related securities backed by borrowers who could benefit from program participation New or unexpected prepayment on mortgage related securities can impair unamortized purchase premiums paid to obtain high coupon investments in the existing low interest rate environment At December we held only three mortgage related securities with high loan coupons expected to be impacted by the HARP program changes Each of the securities carries an investment coupon of and is backed by year fixed rate mortgages issued between to Fair value of these securities was approximately of our total mortgage related security portfolio with an amortized cost of and yielding at December Because the securities were held at an aggregate unamortized purchase discount of accelerated purchase premium amortization for accelerated repayments do to the HARP program is not a concern However any prepayments on these or other mortgage related securities would be subject to reinvestment at much lower rates lowering future net interest income or reducing unrealized gains on securities currently held compared to Cost of funding continued to decline much faster than loan yields during as loan yields were supported by placement of interest rate floors on floating rate loans Tax adjusted net interest income increased during with net interest margin increasing to from in The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate Table of Contents Impacts during and following the close of a national recession and government actions to support the economy including actions by the Federal Reserve reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads remained high for borrower risk across the banking industry During loan yields were stable at compared to during while the cost of deposits including noninterest bearing deposits declined to from during This improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from to during an increase of Tempering the increase in loan to deposit spreads was a decline in yields on securities and other earnings assets of to while non deposit liability funding including Senior Subordinated Note and junior subordinated debenture funding declined just to Average nonaccrual loans totaled during compared to during Based on the average loan yield during the decrease in nonaccrual loans increased net interest margin by approximately basis points during compared to During cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately basis points Average earning assets grew or during driven by an increase in overnight interest bearing funds of or and an increase in average loans of or Average interest bearing liabilities increased or during The primary source of increased average local funding was in our Rewards Checking product which increased or during after growing or during Tax adjusted net interest income increased or to during compared to in An increase in average earning assets changes in volume contributed of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed of the increase As in during loan yields were supported by interest rate floors that increase net interest margin At December approximately of our million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors approximately carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate approximately of principal had in the money loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between basis points and basis points If those prior year rates were assumed to remain the same the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately and respectively based on those existing loan floors and total earning assets for the year ended December compared to Cost of funding declined much faster than loan yields during in part due to systematic insertion of loan interest rate floors upon renewal during the year Tax adjusted net interest income increased nearly during with net interest margin increasing to from in The coupon rate on approximately of gross loans at December was supported by an average interest rate floor basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate During falling short term interest rates caused by a national recession and government actions to support the economy including actions by the Federal Reserve reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads increased for borrower risk across the banking industry During loan yields declined to while the cost of deposits including noninterest bearing deposits declined to This improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from to during an increase of Tempering the increase in loan to deposit

during Tax adjusted net interest income increased or to during compared to in An increase in average earning assets changes in volume contributed of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed of the increase As short term interest rates continued to fall during yields on adjustable rate loans tied to the prime and day LIBOR rates had the potential to reprice at very low yields To avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market we began to systematically insert interest rate floors on commercial related adjustable rate loans and residential mortgage home equity lines of credit upon renewal At December approximately of our million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors approximately carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor The weighted average amount in which actual loan yields were supported by the in the money loan rate floor was approximately basis points on million of adjustable rate loans at December The annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately and respectively based on these existing loan floors and total average earning assets for the year ended December if interest rates were assumed to remain the same Table of Contents Net interest income during benefited from incremental investment income from a leveraged security purchase completed late in In the transaction

average spread of during This transaction added approximately in additional net interest income during compared to and approximately of total gross leveraged investment net interest income during Details on the structure of the related purchase agreements can be found in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The funding source for this leverage security transaction reset from a short term floating rate to a long term fixed rate late in reducing the current transaction spread to less than The decline in transaction spread reduced net interest income from this arrangement by approximately compared to By December spread on the transaction had declined to and was not a significant contributor to net interest income during As investment security yields continue to fall while the related funding source remains fixed we expect the transaction to produce a small amount of negative spread or loss to net interest income during and likely through when of the funding matures Interest Rate Sensitivity We incur market risk primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates We actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure The measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments such as loans and deposits is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated and the resulting net positions are identified Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital while adjusting the asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure We rely primarily on our asset liability structure reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to control interest rate risk In general longer term earning assets are funded by shorter term funding sources allowing us to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates However a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed to the same extent or on the same basis We do not engage in significant trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes Our overall strategy is to coordinate the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of interest rate movement on the net interest margin Table represents our earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates at December It is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment particularly during periods when the interest yield curve is flattening or steepening The following repricing methodologies should be noted Public or government fund MMDA and NOW accounts are considered fully repriced within days Higher yielding retail and non governmental money market and NOW deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within days Rewards Checking NOW accounts and lower rate money market deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within one year Other NOW and savings accounts are considered core deposits as they are generally insensitive to interest rate changes These core deposits are generally considered to reprice beyond five years Nonaccrual loans are considered to reprice beyond years Assets and liabilities with contractual calls or prepayment options are repriced according to the likelihood of the call or prepayment being exercised in the current interest rate environment Measurements taking into account the impact of rising or falling interest rates are based on a parallel yield curve change that is fully implemented within a month time horizon Bank owned life insurance is considered to reprice beyond years Table reflects an asset sensitive positive gap position during the next year with a cumulative one year gap ratio as of December of compared to a negative gap liability sensitive position of at December In general a current positive gap position would be favorable in a rising rate environment but unfavorable in a falling rate environment However net interest income is impacted not only by the timing of product repricing but the extent of the change in pricing which could be severely limited from local competitive pressures This factor can result in changes to net interest income from changing interest rates different than expected from review of the gap table Table of Contents Table Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

at risk A formal liquidity contingency plan exists that directs management to the least expensive liquidity sources to fund sudden and unanticipated liquidity needs Refer to the section labeled LIQUIDITY contained in this Annual Report on Form K We also use various policy measures to assess interest rate risk as described below Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Limits We balance the need for liquidity with the opportunity for increased net interest income available from longer term loans held for investment and securities To measure the impact on net interest income from interest rate changes we model interest rate simulations on a quarterly basis Our policy is that projected net interest income over the next months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates of up to basis points Table presents the projected impact to net interest income by certain rate change scenarios and the change to the one year cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities Table Net Interest Margin Rate Simulation Impacts As of December Cumulative year gap ratio Base Up Down Change in Net Interest Income Year Up during the year Down during the year Change in Net Interest Income Year No rate change base case Following up in year Following down in year Note Simulations after December reflect net interest income changes from a down basis point scenario rather than a down basis point scenario To assess whether interest rate sensitivity beyond one year helps mitigate or exacerbate the short term rate sensitive position a quarterly measure of core funding utilization is made Core funding is defined as liabilities with a maturity in excess of months and capital Core deposits including DDA NOW and non maturity savings accounts except high yield NOW such as Rewards Checking deposits and money market accounts are also considered core long term funding sources The core funding utilization ratio is defined as assets that reprice in excess of months divided by core funding Our target for the core funding utilization ratio is to remain at or below given the same basis point changes in rates that apply to the guidelines for interest rate risk limits exposure described previously Our core funding utilization ratio after a projected basis point increase in rates was at December compared to and at December and respectively This ratio declined during due to a decrease in the average life within the investment security portfolio combined with an increase in the core deposit categories noted above The high level of the core funding utilization ratio at December in the up basis point scenario was due to projected extension in principal payments on residential mortgage loans held in the loan portfolio as well as residential mortgage related securities held in the investment securities portfolio At December in the up basis point scenario securities and loan principal to reprice in years or longer increased approximately or Over of this change was due to changes related to residential mortgage loans or related securities Although above the internal target of this level was considered manageable and monitored quarterly Table of Contents At December internal interest rate simulations that project interest rate changes that maintain the current shape of the yield curve often referred to as parallel yield curve shifts estimated relatively small projected changes to future years net interest income even in more extreme periods of interest rate changes such as up basis points during a month period However if interest rates were to increase more quickly than anticipated and if the yield curve flattened at the same time such as in a flat up basis point change occurring during net interest income would decline during the first three years of the simulation in amounts ranging from to of the base simulation s net interest income to per year When the yield curve flattens repriced short term funding cost such as for terms of one year or less increases while maturing fixed rate balloon loans such as with terms from to years increase much less During flattening periods assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but to a much different extent Current net interest income sensitivity to a rising and flattening yield curve is similar to that seen at December when similar flat up basis point projections indicated net interest income would decline during the first two years of the simulation in amounts ranging from to of the base simulation s net interest income While not expected during in future years interest rates could rise to levels significantly greater than today and exhibit a flattening interest yield curve To minimize such interest rate risk we typically extend the average fixed term of our wholesale funding portfolio of brokered certificates and FHLB advances Extending such funding may decrease net interest income in the current environment since funding with short term interest rate costs would be less expensive but does provide additional protection against rising interest rates in future years At December the average fixed rate term of the wholesale funding portfolio was months During we expect the average fixed term of the wholesale portfolio to decline in anticipation of an extended period of low interest rates and to better manage net interest income in an extended low rate environment Wholesale funding was of total assets at December Although the flat up basis points simulation is projected to negatively impact net interest income we have significant risk to a prolonged period of low or falling rates in the already low rate environment In this situation loan and security yields continue to decline while funding costs reach effective lows reducing net interest margin particularly if average credit spreads were to decline to levels seen prior to pre recessionary levels In the down basis point scenario in the December income simulations net interest income is projected to decline as follows compared to the current base rate scenario Year Year Year Year Year Despite recent rate volatility and periodic continued declines in market interest rates management does not consider such a protracted low interest rate environment to be likely but continues to monitor its asset liability position in light of this potential long term risk to net interest income levels Investment Securities Portfolio The investment securities portfolio is intended to provide us with adequate liquidity flexible asset liability management and a source of stable income During all securities were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value Unrealized gains and losses were excluded from earnings but reported as other comprehensive income in a separate component of stockholders equity net of income tax However during the municipal security portfolio and nonrated trust preferred securities and senior subordinated notes with fair value totaling including unrealized gain of were transferred from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity These securities were transferred to better reflect our intent and practice to hold these long term securities until maturity and to minimize potential volatility to stockholders equity from future changes in unrealized gains and losses in a rising interest rate environment As securities held to maturity changes in unrealized gains and losses after the transfer date are not reflected in stockholders equity and these securities are recorded at amortized cost The original

including Johnson Financial Group Inc River Valley Bancorporation Inc and Northern Bankshares Inc The non rated senior subordinated notes were issued by McFarland State Bank a subsidiary of Northern Bankshares Inc After a significant loss during Johnson Financial Group Inc elected to defer payments of interest on their trust preferred security issue causing us to classify the par value investment as a nonperforming asset During the owners of Johnson Financial Group entered into an agreement with regulators to recapitalize the bank significantly improving its capital position and stability We cannot predict when Johnson Financial Group may resume payment of interest on this issue and we intend to classify it as nonperforming until interest payments begin We regularly review the financial

securities available for sale recorded as a component of stockholders equity was net of deferred taxes of at December Unrealized securities gains and losses net of income tax effects do not impact the level of regulatory capital under current banking regulations We believe investment security yields have a stabilizing effect on net interest margin during periods of interest rate swings and expect to hold existing securities until maturity or repayment unless such funds are needed for liquidity due to unexpected loan growth or depositor withdrawals or if the sale is beneficial to our interest rate risk and return profile Periods of rising interest rates would likely decrease the unrealized fair value of fixed rate securities in our portfolio During we expect to reinvest maturing securities cash flow into securities with average lives generally between to years and to minimize growth in our municipal securities portfolio whose securities have fixed terms generally from to years These actions are designed to reduce our interest rate and market risks inherent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at this time In addition agency securities are considered to be a higher quality collateral asset for pledging purposes than municipal securities which increases contingency liquidity sources compared to During fair value of investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions as shown in Table increased or while agency mortgage related securities increased or and agency debentures declined or Agency debentures matured during a period of very low reinvestment

municipal security portfolio during from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity increased the amortized cost basis to the fair value of the securities at the time of transfer

lending activity for agricultural purposes Our management is involved in the communities we serve and believes it has a strong understanding of the local economy its business leaders and trends in successful business development Based on this knowledge we offer flexible terms and efficient approvals which have allowed us to grow and manage this type of lending As part of the asset liability and interest rate sensitivity management strategy we generally do not retain long term to year fixed rate mortgages in our own portfolio Therefore it is our practice to sell the majority of long term fixed rate mortgage loan originations to secondary market agencies in exchange for a fee From time to time we retain second mortgage loans on certain high value homes requiring total financing above the conforming secondary market limit after selling the first mortgage into the secondary market In addition some local borrowers require mortgage financing that does not fit one of the secondary market programs cannot qualify for secondary market financing because they cannot obtain a qualifying appraisal due to lack of comparable sales or the borrower prefers us to hold the loan in our own portfolio First and second mortgage loans on the balance sheet generally carry fixed rate balloon payment terms of five years or less Consumer and individual loans include short term personal loans automobile and recreational vehicle installment loans and credit card loans We experience extensive competition from local credit unions offering low rates on installment loans and therefore direct resources toward more profitable lending categories such as residential fixed rate mortgages and commercial real estate lending However due to income tax advantages many customers borrow on a tax deductible home equity line of credit for many purposes formerly funded by a consumer installment loan Therefore we consider consumer purpose lending to be represented by the combination of consumer and individual lending and residential mortgage home equity Table of Contents compared to Loans held for investment continue to consist primarily of commercial related loans including commercial and

debt in our markets In addition large regional banks in our markets including BMO Harris Bank who during acquired M I Bank s market leading share position are aggressively pursuing loan growth with our market s highest credit quality customers with low loan coupon rates and spreads These actions could keep loan growth levels low during or contribute to a decline in our net interest margin as we

represent conversion of amortizing commercial purpose loans to interest only loans for a temporary period to increase the problem borrower s cash flow The remaining restructured loans granted a lower interest rate to borrowers for a temporary period to increase borrower operating cash flow Such loans are subject to management review and ongoing monitoring and are made in cases where the borrower s delinquency is considered short term from circumstances the borrower is believed able to overcome or which would reduce our estimated total credit loss on the relationship Nonaccrual loans including nonaccrual restructured loans remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated Therefore some borrowers continue to make substantially all required payments while maintained on non accrual status Table of Contents Substantially all of our residential mortgage loans originated for and held in our loan portfolio were based on conventional and long standing underwriting criteria and are secured by first mortgages on homes in our local markets We were not an originator of higher risk loans such as option ARM products high loan to value ratio mortgages interest only loans subprime loans or loans with initial teaser rates that can have a greater risk of non collection than other loans At December approximately million of loans receivable were family home equity or junior lien mortgage loans in which the maximum commitment amount of the line of credit plus existing senior liens is greater than of the underlying real estate value or were a loan in a rd mortgage position or lower compared to million at December Such loans were not originated as part of a program to add higher yielding loans to our portfolio but were loans made on a case by case basis and individually underwritten with the borrower customized to their need We do not maintain a formal residential mortgage modification program for delinquent residential mortgage borrowers At December the inherent credit loss allocation on non problem open ended home equity lines of credit was of loan principal compared to during and to reflect the risk of future credit losses on such junior lien mortgages from current economic conditions Nonperforming assets include loans that are either contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments on a

addition of of restructured loans which continue to perform on their restructured terms However foreclosed assets decreased from at December to at December Including the trust preferred investment security issued by Johnson Financial Group total nonperforming assets increased or to at December After when the decline in local economic conditions stabilized the local economy remained slow to recover which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms At December the unemployment rate was in Wisconsin and in Marathon County the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from at December compared to a rate of for the United States During we expect restructured loans to increase as we work with problem borrowers to minimize the level of potential future charge offs and maximize cumulative total principal repayment In addition regulatory pressures and a change in generally accepted accounting principles regarding identification of restructured loans are likely to increase loans disclosed as troubled debt restructurings Although some restructured loans may continue on accrual status the restructured designation would still increase total nonperforming loans and could increase the provision for loan losses Table of Contents Approximately of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties

revenue This loan relationship is included in Table as of gross principal This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan is classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan A collateral appraisal was obtained during and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout During we restructured commercial mortgage loans collateralized by cranberry producing agricultural real estate to change from amortizing payments to interest only payments as the property owner sought to sell the operation or partner with new investors This loan relationship is included in Table as of gross principal This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan was classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan A collateral appraisal was obtained during and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout unless the borrower sells the operation to a new investor During million of foreclosed properties originally related to a million land development loan were sold at auction at a loss of excluding a previously expensed auction marketing fee The remaining foreclosed asset was further written down to an estimated fair value of at December for total valuation losses on the property of during when including the marketing fee During one of the four remaining individual properties was sold and the entire sale proceeds were applied to reduce cost basis of the remaining properties During the remaining properties were further written down an additional due to declining real estate values for this type of vacation property As shown in Table three properties remain with cost basis of at December During the northern Wisconsin area where these properties are located experienced few vacation property transactions in excess of million such as would be appropriate for this foreclosed property We actively market these remaining properties for sale but cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset Table of Contents During we entered into a restructuring agreement on a commercial real estate loan with a local developer and owner of multi family apartment complexes to extend the amortization period on existing debt to increase cash flow available to the developer to meet real estate tax and other obligations At December this debt as reflected in Table is maintained on accrual status and no reduction in stated interest rate was made in the modification We obtained a new collateral appraisal during which indicated the property value has declined We estimated various scenarios for future borrower payments on this loan including a liquidation scenario in the current environment Based on our analysis a allowance for loan losses was maintained against the loan at December During we restructured the loan terms on of loan principal to lower the interest rate on existing debt with a borrower in the cabinetry contracting industry to increase cash flow during a large decline in customer sales During the borrower sold the business to a competitor but retained a mortgage on the production facility which is leased to the new owner and gave a purchase option within three years to the new business owner We expect the new owner to exercise the purchase option near the end of the three year term The remaining principal is maintained on accrual status and reflected in Table at December Based on projected cash flows to be received from our borrower from rental payments received by the new business owner we maintained a allowance for loan losses at December compared to a loan loss reserve of in the prior year During we were informed by Johnson Financial Capital Trust of its intent to defer payment of interest on its trust preferred capital debentures Johnson Financial Group is the holding company for Johnson Bank headquartered in Racine Wisconsin and is the second largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin Our investment in the debentures was placed on nonaccrual status and no interest income was recorded during Later in the family ownership of Johnson Financial Group agreed with regulators to recapitalize the bank with approximately million in equity capital The new capital is expected to be fully contributed to the bank by Our internal evaluation has determined this investment is not other than temporarily impaired and no charge against net income for impairment has been recorded During we restructured an owner occupied commercial real estate loan with a local insurance agent The building was constructed during and included additional space to rent to unrelated service businesses The debt was restructured to extend the amortization period to support declining borrower cash flow as portions of the building remained vacant The restructured loan continues to be maintained on accrual status The loan is reflected in Table at December We obtained a new collateral appraisal during which identified that the value of the property had declined We estimated various cash payment scenarios from the borrower including cash flow in connection with a liquidation and sale under current market conditions We maintained an allowance for loan losses against this loan of at December During we restructured a loan secured by an owner occupied restaurant to increase borrower cash flow and allow the business to continue operating During the borrower s residential mortgage loan was also classified as a nonperforming loan which increased net nonperforming principal by to at December The loan is maintained on nonaccrual status and all payments received are used to lower the principal balance During of payments were received reducing the balance to as shown in Table A new collateral appraisal was obtained during and various cash flow scenarios were analyzed including liquidation of the collateral under current market conditions At December an allowance for loan losses of was maintained against this credit compared to the allowance maintained at December We cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this problem loan During we entered into a syndicated construction loan agreement sold by Bankers Bank Madison Wisconsin for construction of vacation condos and an adjacent water park near Hollister Missouri The construction loan was intended to be repaid by the proceeds from a municipal tax incremental financing debt issue by the local municipality When the credit markets for such financing dried up the project was unable to continue and land development work ceased The loan participants obtained the property in foreclosure during The original fair value estimate of the completed project was approximately million At the time of foreclosure we valued our asset using a new liquidation value appraisal based on our approximately ownership of the project resulting in a cost basis of at December and During a new appraisal identified a further decline in value and the loan was written down an additional to its new cost basis of as reflected in Table At this time we are unable to determine the final resolution of this property and further write downs of value could be required during when updated appraisals are obtained compared to The provision for loan losses was in compared to in Non performing loans relative to total loans declined slightly and was at December compared to at December However foreclosed assets increased from at December to at December Therefore total nonperforming assets were or of total assets at December compared to or of total assets at December During the decline in local economic conditions stabilized but at low levels which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms At December year end the unemployment rate was in Wisconsin and in Marathon County the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from at December compared to a rate of for the United States The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked th out of Wisconsin s counties for December from lowest to highest unemployment rate Table of Contents A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December and was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year end If impaired loans and related specific reserves if any were disregarded the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans would have been at December and at December as we continued to increase inherent losses on the loan portfolio during reflecting the uncertainty of ongoing customer credit stress and high delinquency ratios Approximately of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate

described below At December we held a loan secured by commercial real estate collateral located in Weston Wisconsin and marketable equity investments shown in Table on which we completed foreclosure during and charged off of loan principal Later in we recorded a further partial write down of for a remaining cost of as shown in Table During we sold the building and a significant portion of the vacant and recorded a loss on the sale of The remaining foreclosed property consists of vacant land with a balance at December We actively market this property for sale but at this time are unable to determine the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset We do not expect further significant losses on resolution of the foreclosed asset During our borrower in the building supplies industry ceased payments on a loan secured by construction inventory and accounts receivable in part due to uncollected large accounts receivable due to a dispute between our customer and the account payer During we collected in payments which were applied to principal which totaled as shown in Table Due to poor collateral position we reserved against the loan relationship at December which was maintained at December After receipt of final payment during we charged off the remaining of the balance due representing our largest loan charge off during compared to The provision for loan losses was in compared to in Non performing loans relative to total loans continued to increase and was at December compared to at December In addition foreclosed assets increased from at December to at December Therefore total nonperforming assets were or of total assets at December compared to or of total assets at December Non performing loans increased primarily from declining general and local economic conditions which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms At December the unemployment rate was in Wisconsin and in Marathon County the home of the majority of our borrowers compared to a rate of for the United States The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked th out of Wisconsin s counties for December A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December and was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year end If impaired loans and related specific reserves if any were disregarded the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans

noninterest income compared to Total noninterest income during was compared to in a decrease of or During service fees declined or due to lower customer usage of our courtesy overdraft program and related overdraft fees in response to new regulation concerning this product effective in August The new regulation requires that certain payments by consumers who did not opt into the bank s overdraft program are not paid by the bank reducing overdraft fee income In addition the new regulation and negative publicity concerning banks and their overdraft protection programs continue to lower customer usage of the product and we could see further service fee income declines during related to overdrafts In addition mortgage banking income declined or as residential mortgage rates began to settle at historically low levels during Offsetting these declines was commission income on sale of fixed interest rate swaps to commercial adjustable rate loan customers of during The swap product was a new product during and is included in other operating income in Table above Certain commercial customers with adjustable rate loans with us may choose to enter into an interest rate swap with us to convert their floating rate interest payments to a fixed rate We simultaneously sell these fixed rate hedge contracts to a correspondent bank in exchange for a fee Table of Contents During the Federal Reserve finalized regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act related to debit card interchange income often referred to as the Durbin Amendment These new changes cap the amount of debit card interchange income that may be collected by large banks from merchants for processing card activity While the new rules technically do not apply to us as a smaller bank the impacts are expected to become uniform for the industry over time as merchants use their new authority and options to process customer card activity across a wider number of providers While the timing is uncertain these fully implemented changes could lower our annualized debit card interchange revenue by approximately down approximately from revenue levels prior to the regulatory change In general the banking industry has begun to respond to lower debit card fee revenue by reducing customer account reward programs and related costs and increasing account service fees We continue to investigate the nature and timing of potential future retail checking account changes in response to the expected reduction of debit card income Many important sources of noninterest income are impacted by recent and coming federal regulation including overdraft service fee income and debit card income as noted previously In addition the prolonged period of declining residential mortgage rates is gradually lowering the level of mortgage refinanced activity In addition we discontinued selling the Rewards Checking NOW product during which rewarded customers for higher levels of debit card activity We expect lower usage of debit cards due to this change Because we expect overdraft income debit card income and mortgage income to decline during we expect total noninterest income to decline during compared to compared to During total noninterest income declined or to compared to during However excluding nonrecurring net gains losses on security sales noninterest income increased or compared to Although mortgage banking income declined as more borrowers refinanced their residential mortgages when rates fell significantly during compared to several other types of income experienced significant increases For example service charge income increased or from higher overdraft fee income and investment and insurance sales commissions increased or from higher gross sales activity Prior to new regulation which lowered overdraft activity the bank had rolled out an updated courtesy overdraft product early in which increased year over year overdraft income and service fee income despite the regulatory change Lastly interchange income from credit and debit cards increased or during compared to Many of the increases in were in areas expected to be impacted by continued regulatory changes including overdraft fees and card interchange income Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in due to increased Rewards Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account We discontinued selling the Rewards Checking account to new customers in which is likely to decrease debit card interchange income in future years New consumer banking regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve concerning customer overdraft programs went into effect during August The new regulation prevents banks from assessing an overdraft fee related to a transaction conducted at a point of sale such as those using a debit card unless the consumer has specifically opted into the program From the effective date of the regulation to the end of we experienced an approximately reduction in gross overdraft activity compared to activity prior to the regulatory change Prior to bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance However limited further investments in this asset class are expected compared to Noninterest income excluding gain loss on sale of securities increased during from a record year of mortgage banking income totaling up over as customers refinanced their long term fixed rate residential mortgages Residential loan principal sold to the secondary market during was approximately times and times the levels seen during and respectively This activity was promoted by historically low long term mortgage rates During total noninterest income was compared to during an increase of or The most significant components of the change include a gain on sale of securities of as well as increased mortgage banking income of in addition to a loss on FNMA stock of incurred during Excluding these special items noninterest income would have increased or during United States Treasury programs and open market mortgage related asset purchases by the Federal Reserve during dramatically lowered long term residential mortgage rates

deposit losses Dodd Frank legislation effective during changed the method in which deposit insurance premiums are calculated Premium levels are now assessed based on net assets after deducting Tier regulatory capital rather than being assessed based on the level of deposits held The effect of this change was to transfer a greater portion of total industry deposit insurance premiums to the nation s largest banks as they typically maintain a lower percentage of deposits to assets compared to smaller banks like us Debit card losses were higher in due to sustaining a net loss from a concentrated fraud involving certain of our customer accounts Salaries and employee benefits declined or from in to in due primarily to an decrease in health and dental insurance expense During data processing expenses increased or compared to due to outsourced data processing costs associated with the new computer system placed in service during June However occupancy and facilities expense declined during in part from lower computer equipment depreciation expense previously incurred with the prior in house computer system and categorized as occupancy expenses During data processing expense is expected to increase at a rate similar to that seen during as we experience a full year of regular contract charges Following the June conversion we had enjoyed discounted monthly vendor charges to help offset conversion related costs incurred during the first year of using the new system During wages and benefits are expected to increase minimally with average base pay increases of granted January compared to average base pay increases of granted for Although less than seen during employee incentive costs remained historically high as net income exceeded the target Depending on net income growth during such increased incentives may not recur potentially reducing employee costs For example if our net income was the same as in incentive costs could decline to during compared to Health and dental insurance costs are incurred under a self insured plan subject to a maximum stop loss Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information We expect health and dental costs to increase closer to levels experienced during Table of Contents Foreclosed asset expense is expected to decline during due to lower levels of partial charge offs of foreclosed properties as local real estate values stabilize Partial charge offs of foreclosed property from value declines were in compared to during and during In addition we expect to experience lower holding costs as the remaining investment in foreclosed assets remains near current levels which is significantly lower than seen during Changes to FDIC insurance assessment methods as part of the Dodd Frank legislation are expected to keep our FDIC insurance premium expense during similar to levels However the FDIC insurance rate is subject to the level of industry wide bank closures and related deposit insurance fund losses which is unpredictable and could be greater in future years than seen during Although not expected during accelerated or unexpected levels of bank failures within the industry could cause the FDIC to increase premiums or collect special assessments to make up insurance fund shortfalls Lastly our specific insurance rating is dictated in large part by results of our annual regulatory exam While not expected negative regulatory exam results could significantly increase our FDIC insurance premium expense During advertising and promotional expense is expected to increase modestly as

FDIC insurance assessment totaling Prior to the special assessment FDIC insurance expense increased or Offsetting the decline in FDIC expense was an increase in data processing and other office operations expense of or due to a change in core processing computer system during June from an internally maintained system to an outsourced vendor system Following the June conversion date the system vendor provided a contractual reduction in monthly service fees that expired during The new system while increasing data processing costs provides significant operating efficiencies and capacity for customer and product growth compared to the prior system maintained in house since The prior in house data processing system recognized a significant portion of the cost as elements of depreciation expense reflected as occupancy expense while software maintenance charges were reflected as data processing costs During we incurred a loss related to debit card fraud net of insurance reimbursements that resulted from a coordinated external fraud targeting us and our debit card customers Even excluding this individual loss debit card losses of were significantly higher than seen

expense at the statutory tax rate during and respectively The reductions have come from higher levels of pretax income during and combined with lower tax exempt yields on municipal securities and life insurance as long term rates declined in the overall market Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax information Due to declining average reinvestment rates on tax exempt municipal securities we expect the effective tax rate to increase slightly during compared to The effective tax rate increased over from a change in State of Wisconsin income tax law to a combined reporting model This change subjected investment income earned on investment securities held by PSB Investments Inc Peoples State Bank s investment subsidiary to state income taxes Previously income on these investments was not subject to Wisconsin income taxes This change in taxation method increased our provision for income taxes by during compared to The effective tax rate would have been without the state tax regulation change Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses As noted previously during the quarter ended March we changed our methodology to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses The changes were made in response to several regulatory and industry factors including greater transparency in allowance and loss activity by loan segment and class greater reliance on various external and internal factors to determine contingency reserves on loans not considered to be impaired and greater reliance on estimates of future cash flows on impaired loans to estimate required allowances with lesser reliance on impaired loan collateral fair value to determine required allowances Current accounting standards call for the allowance for loan losses to include both specific losses on identified impaired problem loans and inherent contingent losses on existing loan pools not yet considered problem loans Determination of the allowance for loan losses at period end is based primarily on subjective factors and management assessment of risk in the existing portfolio Actual results if significantly different from those using estimates at period end could have a material impact on the results of operations For example losses incurred on loans not previously identified as carrying significant loss potential would increase the provision for loan losses expense equal to the amount of the loan principal charged off Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on allocation of the allowance for loan losses between different credit risk categories and for impaired loans as well as our system to review changes in credit risk on individual loans Loans receivable for the purpose of estimating the allowance for loan losses are separated into loan categories Performing loans categories all of which are assigned inherent loss reserves Residential mortgages Home equity lines of credit Consumer and individual loans Commercial real estate loans credit risk grades high quality through grade acceptable risk Commercial and industrial loans grades through Problem loans assigned inherent loss reserves categories Commercial real estate loans grade watch and grade substandard loans Commercial and industrial loans grade watch and grade substandard loans Impaired loans assigned specific reserves categories Commercial real estate loans grade impaired Commercial and industrial loans grade impaired Residential mortgage consumer and other personal loans grade impaired Commercial purpose loans are subcategorized into the credit risk grades based on an internal determination of risk established during credit analysis and updated no less than annually Determination of risk grades takes into account several factors including collateral cash flow borrower s industry environment financial statement strength and other factors Identified impaired problem loans under current accounting standards are classified into the lowest quality risk grade grade Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans loans identified as restructurings of troubled debt and loans accruing interest with elevated risk of default in the near term based on a variety of credit factors Table of Contents Inherent loss reserves are assigned as a percentage of estimated loss on principal within each category and are based on the following historical and subjective factors Weighted average historical net charge off of principal by category during the past quarters Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of external factors including changes in economic conditions changes in nature volume of portfolio changes in collateral values changes in regulatory requirements and changes in peer data Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of internal factors including changes in bank policies changes in underwriting criteria changes in volume of past due loans changes in internal local review processes and management turnover Inherent loss reserves for loans categories graded watch and grade substandard are provided additional contingency reserves beyond those described above to reflect the emerging credit risk represented by loans within these categories These additional contingency reserves are based on the average specific reserves calculated for impaired loans by category at period end Grade watch loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category Grade substandard loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category Specific reserves are calculated on each individual borrower by estimating future cash flows associated with borrower payments and foreclosure value of collateral associated with the loan Cash flows expected from foreclosure of collateral are discounted for closing costs and based on estimated current collateral and property values Estimated cash flows are discounted by the loan contract rate to determine the present value of future cash flows For loans considered to be restructurings of trouble debt the cash flows are discounted using the loan contract rate in place prior to any loan modifications Loans considered collateral dependent are assigned reserves based on the net cash value of collateral without consideration of discounted estimated cash flows After calculating the estimate of required allowances for loan losses using the steps above a further subjective analysis of current and projected economic conditions problem loan trends and other factors may cause additional unallocated reserves to be recorded to reflect this additional risk of loss before it is recognized by the change in commercial credit risk grades or the increase in the historical inherent loss percentage assigned to loan categories As of December and no unallocated loan loss allowances were recorded Estimates of inherent losses on non problem loans are a significant accounting estimate due to the many economic and subjective factors involved in estimating future losses based on existing negative factors associated with unidentified future problem loans currently making payments Reliance on historical charge off activity and subjective factors related to external and internal factors is expected to increase volatility in allowance for loan losses which could increase volatility in quarterly net income as conditions change and increase or decrease the existing allowance for loan losses For example if the actual inherent losses on the five performing loan categories evaluated using inherent loss estimates as described above were greater than those currently applied to meet reserve needs the December allowance for loan losses would have increased and have decreased net income by approximately after income taxes In addition an unexpected downgrade of loans classified grade watch and grade substandard to impaired status could significantly increase total allowance for loan losses as those downgraded loans are allocated allowances based on projected cash flow or collateral values on an individualized basis For example at December if all of the loans graded substandard and of loan principal graded watch were reclassified as impaired loans and experienced the average loss allocation currently reflected in the impaired loan portfolio the allowance for loan losses at December would have increased and decreased net income by approximately after income taxes Mortgage Servicing Rights As required by current accounting standards we record a mortgage servicing right asset MSR when we continue to service borrower payments and perform maintenance activities in exchange for an annual servicing fee of of average serviced mortgage principal on loans in which the principal has been sold to the FHLB or other secondary market investors Our initial value of servicing rights is calculated on an individual loan level basis and uses public financial market information for many of the significant estimates In the period in which the principal is sold to the secondary market investors we increase the gain on sale of the loan by the value of the initial MSR If the actual value was less than we recorded such as if the estimated future servicing period or average serviced principal was less than estimated the gain recorded on origination of the MSR would be overstated Recognition of impairment of excess mortgage servicing rights would decrease income causing our accounting for mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy For example if the actual value of initial MSR on secondary market sales were less than that recorded gain on sale of loans a component of mortgage banking income during would have declined approximately before income taxes In addition if the actual value of the entire December MSR were less than recorded net servicing revenue a component of mortgage banking income would have declined approximately before income taxes Table of Contents We make the following estimates and perform the following procedures when accounting for MSRs Serviced loans are stratified by risk of prepayment criteria Currently strata are first based on the year in which the loan was originated then on term and then on the range of interest rates within that term We use a discount approach to generate the initial value for the OMSR The calculation takes the average of the current dealer consensus on prepayment speeds as reported by Andrew Davidson Company or the prepayment speed implied in the mortgage backed security prices for newly created loans along with other assumptions to generate an estimate of future cash flows The present value of estimated cash flows equals the fair value of the OMSR We capitalize the lower of fair value or cost of the OMSR Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for significant fair value and cost estimates other than the estimate of public dealer consensus of prepayment speeds Changes in these estimates and assumptions would change the initial value recorded for OMSRs and change the gain on sale of mortgage loans recorded in the income statement Amortization of the OMSR is calculated based on actual payment activity on a per loan basis Because all loans are handled individually curtailments decrease MSRs as well as regularly scheduled payments The loan servicing value is amortized on a level yield basis Significant declines in current market mortgage interest rates decrease the fair value of existing MSRs due to the increase in anticipated prepayments above the original assumed speed Accounting standards require that impairment testing be performed and that MSRs be recorded at the lower of fair value or amortized cost We perform quarterly impairment testing on our MSRs Actual prepayment speeds based on our actual customer activity on a loan level basis are compared to the assumed prepayment speed on the date of the last quarterly impairment testing or the origination prepayment speed if a recently originated loan The fair value assumptions other than prepayment speed are combined with the new estimated prepayment speed to create a new fair value An impairment allowance is recorded for any shortfall between the new fair value and the original cost after adjusting for past amortization and

Average CDARS balances declined as local municipalities that fueled growth seeking FDIC protection withdraw balances for operational needs as well as to invest in other deposit products outside the CDARS program For regulatory purposes these deposits are considered brokered deposits and disclosed as such on quarterly regulatory filings However for internal and external reporting other than for Call Report purposes these deposits are considered to be retail deposits since the terms of the account are set directly between us and our local customer on a retail basis Accordingly these deposits are included as Retail time deposits and over in the Tables in this section Total CDARS deposits totaled and at December and respectively Originally available under the TARP legislation passed by the federal government during and now required under the provisions of Dodd Frank we participated in the FDIC program which provided unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest bearing deposits in excess of

those paid on money market and NOW accounts Therefore customers appeared to move funds out of time deposits into nonmaturity accounts that allowed them to access the funds without penalty such as when deposited into a time deposit Nonmaturity money market and NOW accounts increased during Table of Contents Rewards Checking was the primary driver of increased deposit growth since its introduction in June through December During this period Rewards Checking supplied approximately of our net core deposit growth During we grandfathered existing Rewards Checking customers but discontinued selling the product Rewards Checking operated as a traditional interest bearing checking account but paid a premium interest rate and reimbursement of foreign ATM fees if the customer meet certain account usage requirements In general the account required customers to use their debit card at least times per month deposit their employer paycheck via ACH and receive their periodic checking account statement via email from our home banking website The premium rewards annual percentage yield APY paid was and on the first of balances at December and respectively At December the premium rate paid was on the first of deposit balances The Rewards Checking interest rate is adjustable at our discretion but was intended to provide the highest potential retail deposit rate product available to customers The debit card usage requirement substantially increased the amount of debit card interchange income through as described previously under the section titled Noninterest income Prior to the incremental all in cost of Rewards Checking deposits was less than wholesale funding alternatives and was believed to be a long term cost effective source of funds in addition to providing PSB with a competitive advantage in the retail banking environment and greater control over the repricing of local deposits in a rising rate environment Rewards Checking balances were and at December and respectively The average interest cost of Rewards Checking balances excluding debit card interchange fees savings from delivery of electronic periodic statements and vendor software costs of maintaining the program was in compared to in and in Average balances in Rewards Checking are expected to remain between million and million during Changes to debit card interchange income contained in Dodd Frank and proposed by the Federal Reserve were anticipated to have a dramatic impact to the profitability of Rewards Checking We are currently evaluating other product options attractive to our customers that meet market needs and minimize our operating expenses and servicing costs in light of reduced interchange income These products could replace Rewards Checking or be priced in a manner more attractive than Rewards Checking in light of the potential decrease to debit card interchange income Because Rewards Checking deposit growth has been the significant driver of local deposit growth in past years changes to this account structure could reduce future deposit growth Although government deposits grew significantly during from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account nonmaturity government balances continued a decline of or to at December after a decline of or to at December compared to December As loan growth slowed significantly during we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances We held million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts from our ten largest deposit customers making up approximately of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December Many of the balances at year end were seasonal deposits and expected to be withdrawn during the first several months of In light of the seasonal nature of many large accounts at year end and expected low organic loan growth during we expect small increases to local deposit growth in our existing markets during compared to Local core deposits increased up at December compared December An increase in commercial money market funds of or led the increase in deposits The increase of

which increased money market deposits by at December These funds were seasonal and declined early in Government deposits grew significantly during from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account but declined or to at December compared to December As loan growth slowed significantly during we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances If a new overnight repurchase agreement account opened in were also included we held million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts form the ten largest customers making up approximately of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December Many of the balances at year end were seasonal deposits and were withdrawn during the first several months of Wholesale Funding Sources and Available Liquidity Our asset liability management process provides a unified approach to management of liquidity capital and interest rate risk as well as providing adequate funds to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flow of our customers We view liquidity as the ability to raise cash at a reasonable cost or with a minimum of loss and as a measure of balance sheet flexibility to react to marketplace regulatory and competitive changes Table of Contents The primary short term and long term funding sources we use other than retail deposits include federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks repurchase agreements from security pledging advances from the FHLB use of wholesale time deposits and advances taken from the Federal Reserve s Discount Window Table outlines the available and unused portion of these funding sources based on collateral and or company policy limitations as of December and Currently unused but available funding sources along with a significant amount of overnight liquid funds at December are considered sufficient to fund anticipated asset growth We maintain formal policies to address liquidity contingency needs and to manage a liquidity crisis Table provides a summary of how the wholesale funding sources normally available to us would be impacted by various operating conditions Table Environmental Impacts on Availability of Wholesale Funding Sources Normal Moderately Highly Operating Stressed Stressed Environment Environment Environment Repurchase

December December Unused but Amount Unused but Amount Available Used Available Used Overnight federal funds purchased Federal Reserve discount window advances FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien Repurchase agreements and other FHLB advances Wholesale and national deposits Holding company secured line of credit Totals Funding as a percent of total assets The following discussion examines each of the available but unused funding sources listed in the table above and the factors that may directly or indirectly influence the timing or the amount ultimately available to us compared to Overnight federal funds purchased Our aggregate federal funds purchased availability of is from three correspondent banks The most significant portion of the total is from our primary correspondent bank Bankers Bank located in Madison Wisconsin an increase from at December We make regular use of the Bankers Bank line as part of our normal daily cash settlement procedures but rarely have used the lines offered by the other two correspondent banks Federal funds must be repaid each day and borrowings may be renewed for up to consecutive business days To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line we need to maintain a composite ratio as defined by Bankers Bank of or less Bankers Bank defines the composite ratio to be nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets divided by tangible capital including the allowance for loan losses calculated at our subsidiary bank level Due to existence of the composite ratio an increase in nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets could impact availability of the line or subject us to further review In addition a rising composite ratio could cause our other two correspondent banks to reconsider their federal funds line with us since they do not also serve as our primary correspondent bank Our subsidiary bank s composite ratio was approximately and at December and December respectively and less than the benchmark used by Bankers Bank Table of Contents Federal Reserve discount window advances We have a line of credit with the Federal Reserve Discount Window supported by a pledge of both commercial and commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve under their Borrower in Custody BIC program During the annualized interest rate applicable to Discount Window advances was Under the BIC program we provide a monthly listing of detailed loan information on the loans provided as collateral We are subject to annual review and certification by the Federal Reserve to retain participation in the program The Discount Window represents the primary source of liquidity on a daily basis following our federal funds purchased lines of credit discussed above We were limited to a maximum advance of and at December and December respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged Discount Window advances must be repaid or renewed each day No Discount Window advances were used during Only performing loans are permitted as collateral under the BIC and each individual loan is subject to a haircut to collateral value based on the Federal Reserve s review of the listing each month In general approximately of the loan principal offered as collateral is able to support Discount Window advances Similar to the federal funds purchased lines of credit an increase in nonperforming loans would decrease the amount of collateral available for Discount Window advances Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances We maintain an available line of credit with the FHLB of Chicago based on a pledge of to family mortgage loan collateral both first and secondary lien positions We may borrow on the line to the lesser of the blanket mortgage lien collateral provided or times our existing FHLB capital stock investment Based on the our existing capital stock investment total FHLB advances in excess of require us to purchase additional FHLB stock equal to of the advance amount At December we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to of the available without the purchase of FHLB stock At December we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to of the available without the purchase of FHLB stock Further advances of the remaining available at December would have required us to purchase additional FHLB stock totaling FHLB stock pays a nominal dividend of with expectations of continuing this dividend level Therefore additional FHLB advances carry additional cost relative to other wholesale borrowing alternatives due to the requirement to hold low yielding FHLB stock Similar to the Discount Window only performing residential mortgage loans may be pledged to the FHLB under the blanket lien In addition we are subject to a haircut of approximately on first mortgage collateral and on secondary lien collateral at December and December The FHLB also conducts periodic audits of collateral identification and submission procedures and adjusts the collateral haircuts higher in response to negative exam findings The FHLB also assigns a credit risk grade to each member based on a quarterly review of the member s regulatory CALL report Our current credit risk is within the normal range for a healthy member bank Negative financial performance trends such as reduced capital levels increased nonperforming assets net operating losses and other factors can increase a member s credit risk grade Higher risk grades can require a member to provide detailed loan collateral listings rather than a blanket lien physical collateral and other restrictions on the maximum line usage FHLB advances are available on a daily basis and along with Discount Window advances represent a primary source of liquidity following our federal funds purchased lines of credit FHLB advances carry substantial penalties for early prepayment that are generally not recovered from the lower interest rates in refinancing The amount of early prepayment penalty is a function of the difference between the current borrowing rate and the rate currently available for refinancing Under a new collateral and pledging agreement we maintain with the FHLB effective April we are also permitted to pledge commercial related collateral for advances However we did not pledge any commercial loan collateral to the FHLB at December Recently the FHLB of Chicago announced a capital stock conversion plan effective January Under the plan existing member stock of which we currently hold million was restructured into two classes Under the capital conversion plan the FHLB repurchased of our stock in early Our remaining shares of were restructured and are considered B capital shares Excess holdings of B shares may be redeemed by the FHLB at the request of a member following a five year redemption period However a member must continue to hold capital stock no less than of outstanding FHLB advances Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Wholesale repurchase agreements may be available from a correspondent bank counterparty for both overnight and longer terms Such arrangements typically call for the agreement to be collateralized by us at of the repurchase principal In the current market repurchase counterparty providers are extremely limited and would likely require a minimum million transaction Repurchase agreements could require up to several business days to receive funding Due to the lack of availability of counterparties offering the product wholesale repurchase agreements are not a reliable source of liquidity At December million of our repurchase agreements are wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and million are overnight repurchase agreements with local customers using our treasury management services At December million of our repurchase agreements were wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and million were overnight repurchase agreements with local customers Table of Contents In addition to availability of FHLB advances under the blanket mortgage lien we also have the ability to pledge investment securities as collateral against FHLB advances Advances secured by investments are also subject to the FHLB stock ownership requirement as described previously Due to the need to purchase additional FHLB member stock FHLB advances secured by investments are not considered a primary source of liquidity At December of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional of member capital stock were purchased At December of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional of member capital stock were purchased The amount available for pledging increased since December due to an increase in the securities portfolio in general and a decrease in local customer repurchase agreements which freed up security collateral for pledging to the FHLB Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position balance sheet and ongoing earnings we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered deposits to of total assets which gave availability of at December and at December Brokered and national certificates were and of assets at December and December respectively Due to a limited number of providers of repurchase agreement funding as well as our desire to retain unencumbered securities for liquidity purposes and adverse impacts from holding additional FHLB capital stock brokered certificate of deposit funding is expected to increase to the extent future loan growth is not funded with local deposit growth Participants in the brokered certificate market must be considered well capitalized under current regulatory capital standards to acquire brokered deposits without approval of their primary federal regulator We regularly acquire brokered deposits from three market providers and maintain relationships with other providers to obtain required funds at the lowest possible cost Ten business days are typically required between the request for brokered funding and settlement Therefore brokered deposits are a reliable but not daily source of liquidity Brokered deposits represent our largest source of wholesale funding and we would see significant negative impacts if capital levels or earnings were to decline to levels not considered to be well capitalized In addition to the requirement to be considered well capitalized banks under regulatory consent orders are not permitted to participate in the brokered deposit market without approval of their primary federal regulator even if they maintain a well capitalized capital classification Holding company unsecured line of credit We maintained a line of credit with a Bankers Bank Madison Wisconsin as a contingency liquidity source at December At December we maintained a line of credit with U S Bank No amounts were drawn on either line at December or Although our bank subsidiary has in the past provided the holding company s liquidity needs through semi annual upstream dividends of profits losses or other negative performance trends could prevent the bank from providing these dividends as cash flow Because our bank holding company has approximately of financing payments per year as well as approximately of other expenses before tax benefits the holding company line of credit is a critical source of potential liquidity We were subject to financial covenants associated with the line as of December which required our bank subsidiary to Maintain Tier leverage Tier risk based capital and Tier risk based capital ratios above and respectively Maintain nonperforming assets excluding accruing troubled debt restructured loans as a percentage of tangible equity plus the allowance for loan losses to less than At December we were not in violation of any of the line of credit covenants A violation of any covenant could prevent us from utilizing the unused balance of the line of credit The line of credit expires during December but is expected to be renewed upon maturity If liquidity needs persist after exhausting all available funds from the sources described above we would consider more drastic methods to raise funds including but not limited to sale of investment securities at a loss cessation of lending to new or existing customers sale of branch real estate in a sale leaseback transaction surrender of bank owned life insurance to obtain the cash surrender value net of taxes due packaging and sale of residential mortgage loan pools held in our portfolio sale of foreclosed assets at a loss and sale of mortgage servicing rights Such actions could generate undesirable sale losses or income tax impacts While sale of additional common stock or issuance of other types of capital could provide additional liquidity the ability to find significant buyers of such capital issues during a liquidity crisis would be difficult making such a source of funding unlikely or unreliable if the liquidity crisis was caused by our deteriorating financial condition Table of Contents compared to Overnight federal funds purchased Our aggregate federal funds purchase availability was at December compared to at December To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line we need to maintain a composite ratio as defined by Bankers Bank of or less At December our subsidiary bank s composite ratio was approximately and less than the benchmark used by Bankers Bank During and the only federal funds line used was our line from Bankers Bank as part of our regular daily cash management system Federal Reserve discount window advances During we were granted permission by the Federal Reserve to participate in their Borrower in Custody BIC program that allows us to pledge performing commercial and commercial real estate loans against overnight Discount Window advances During the annualized interest rate due on Discount Window advances was although this rate was increased to by the Federal Reserve on February We could draw up to million on our Discount Window line of credit but were limited to a maximum advance of and at December and respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged At December we could borrow on the Discount Window approximately to of the principal amount of loans pledged under the BIC program No Discount Window advances were used during or Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances During the FHLB made available the pledging of certain municipal investment securities against advances which could increase our maximum advance liquidity with the FHLB although this increase is not reflected in Table due to specific limitations on the municipal securities eligible to be pledged Although up to an additional of FHLB advances could be obtained on existing mortgage collateral due to our desire to maintain our current investment in FHLB capital stock of the amount of unused but available FHLB advances at December before additional capital stock would be required is Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Securities not pledged to the Federal Reserve for the Discount Window or pledged to the FHLB for advances are available for pledging against repurchase agreements During borrower costs related to repurchase agreements increased compared to other wholesale funding alternatives and the number of correspondent banks providing such financing declined No wholesale repurchase agreements were used during As an alternative to pledging securities against repurchase agreements such securities could also be pledged against FHLB advances as noted previously subject to the purchase of additional FHLB capital stock for aggregate advances in excess of Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position balance sheet and ongoing earnings we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered certificates to of total assets which gave availability of at December and at December Brokered certificates were of assets at December and of assets at December Holding company unsecured line of credit Our parent company PSB Holdings Inc maintained a line of credit with U S Bank as contingency liquidity at the holding company level at December and The line of credit remained unused during and Liquidity Measurements and Contingency Plan Our liquidity management and contingency plan calls for quarterly measurement of key funding capital problem loan and liquidity contingency ratios at our banking subsidiary level The measurements are compared to various risk levels that direct management to further responses to declining liquidity measurements as outlined below Risk Level is defined as circumstances that create the potential for elevated liquidity risk thus requiring an assessment of possible funding deficiencies Normal business operations plans and strategies are not anticipated to be immediately impacted Risk Level is defined as circumstances that point to an increased potential for disruptions in the Bank s funding plans needs and or resources Assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis is more urgent and identification and prioritization of pre emptive alternatives and actions may be both warranted and time sensitive Table of Contents Risk Level is defined as circumstances that create a likely funding problem or are symptomatic of circumstances that are highly correlated with impending funding problems and therefore are expected to require some level of immediate action depending upon the situation These risk parameters and other qualitative and environmental factors are considered to determine whether a Stress Level response is required Identification of a risk trigger does not automatically call for a stress level response The following summarizes our response plans to various degrees of liquidity stress Stress Level A Management provides a written summary evaluating the warning indicators and why it is deemed unlikely that there will be a resulting liquidity challenge Stress Level B Management provides an assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis and completes a sources and uses of funds report to estimate the impact on pro forma liquidity Liquidity stress tests will be reviewed to ensure the scenarios being simulated are sufficiently robust and that there is adequate funding to satisfy potential demands for cash Various pre emptive actions will be considered and acted on as needed Stress Level C Management has determined a funding crisis is likely and documents detailed assessments of the current liquidity situation and future liquidity needs The Board approved action plan is carried out with vigor and may call for one or all of the following steps among others to mitigate the liquidity concern sale of loans intensify local deposit gathering programs transferring unencumbered securities and loans to the Federal Reserve for Discount Window borrowings curtail all lending except for specifically approved loans reduce or suspend stock dividends and investigate opportunities to raise new capital During we increased our Risk Level trigger points related to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans relative to capital The Risk Level trigger for commercial and industrial loans was increased from of capital at December to of capital as of December Likewise the Risk Level trigger for commercial real estate loans was increased from at December to at December These increases were considered appropriate due to our concentration on commercial related lending to local borrowers and relatively low levels of capital and therefore we consistently exceeded these triggers at the prior year levels However we have historically experienced net loan charge offs on commercial related lending less than similar sized banks and do not consider this mix of loans to signify an undercapitalized position No Risk Level triggers were exceeded at December and no liquidity stress levels were considered to exist At December commercial and industrial loans were of capital and commercial real estate loans were of capital exceeding their Risk Level trigger points of and respectively However no liquidity stress level was considered to exist at December As part of our formal quarterly asset liability management projections we also measure basic surplus as the amount of existing net liquid assets after deducting short term liabilities and coverage for anticipated deposit funding outflows during the next days divided by total assets The basic surplus calculation does not consider unused but available correspondent bank federal funds purchased as those funds are subject to availability based on the correspondent bank s own liquidity needs and therefore are not guaranteed contractual funds However basic surplus does include unused but available FHLB advances under the open line of credit supported by a blanket lien on mortgage collateral Basic surplus does not include available brokered certificate of deposit funding as those funds generally may not be obtained within one business day following the request for funding Our policy is to maintain a basic surplus of at least Basic surplus was and at December and December respectively CAPITAL RESOURCES We are required to maintain minimum levels of capital to be considered well capitalized under current banking regulation Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these requirements and our current capital position relative to these requirements The Dodd Frank Act calls for higher regulatory minimums to be considered well capitalized Although we expect the new capital guidelines to be published in no written guidance has yet been provided on how much the minimum levels will be raised In addition regulatory limitations on fee income and higher compliance burdens are expected to spur a wave of bank consolidation and merger and acquisition activity in the coming years Acquisition of another bank or bank location for growth would likely pressure our regulatory capital ratios lower and increase the potential for a new common or preferred stock capital issue which could dilute existing stockholders The primary increase in stockholders equity during the three years ended December has been retained net income not distributed to stockholders via cash dividends or share buybacks on the open market Failure to remain well capitalized would prevent us from obtaining future wholesale broker time deposits which have been an important source of funding during the past several years Refer to Item Statement of Changes in Stockholder s Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed activity in the capital accounts Average tangible common capital to total

this Annual Report on Form K Prior to we maintained an informal annual ongoing share repurchase program of up to of outstanding shares per year as described in Item of this Annual Report on Form K Due to the difficulty and related cost of raising new capital to support asset growth at this time we temporarily suspended the buyback program beginning during and no shares were repurchased during the three years ended December While we do not expect to buyback a significant number of shares as treasury stock during share repurchases on the open market are one strategy we could consider to build shareholder value if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year During we issued of senior subordinated notes to provide regulatory capital to support commercial loan growth during and Refer to Item Note in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the issue Beginning July we have the ability to repay the Notes in part or in full Repayment of the Notes to reduce interest expense is a strategy that could be considered during if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year We have issued trust preferred securities represented by junior subordinated debentures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which may provide up to of our total Tier regulatory capital Refer to Item Note in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the trust preferred security issue The Dodd Frank Act no longer permits us to issue new trust preferred securities as Tier capital as in prior years although our existing million trust preferred capital securities are grandfathered as Tier capital Senior Subordinated Notes and Junior Subordinated Debentures represent approximately of our total regulatory capital Unlike our common stock these capital obligations require regular quarterly interest payments that may not be eliminated if our financial condition were to deteriorate although the interest payments on junior subordinated notes could be deferred for up to five years before considered a default of the debt Therefore we expect any future capital needs during the next several years beyond retained earnings from operations to be met via issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock although no current plans for issuance of common or preferred stock exist Table of Contents In December the U S Treasury introduced a new small bank capital program known as the Small Business Lending Fund established by the Small Business Jobs Act with funding up to billion in an effort to spur small business lending Under the program only available to well performing banks less than billion in assets such as us banks may issue Preferred Stock to the U S Treasury with a variable dividend rate that could later be fixed as low as depending on the level of small business lending growth during the first quarters following issuance of the preferred stock The preferred stock dividend later resets to on the year anniversary of the preferred stock issue until repaid We decided not to participate in the Small Business Lending Fund due to concerns over the extent of organic loan growth available and strict limitations on using the capital to support assets obtained in purchase of another bank as well has our historically high level of existing regulatory capital We are considered well capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of at December compared to at December Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of to be considered well capitalized During total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to risk weighting rather than the risk weighting assigned in prior years In addition we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio These changes along with retained net income increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than We maintain an incentive stock option plan approved by stockholders during and a restricted stock plan as described in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The total expense recognized under both plans was and during and respectively As a measurement of the adequacy of a bank s capital base related to its level of nonperforming assets many investors use a non GAAP measure commonly referred to as the Texas Ratio We also track changes in our Texas Ratio against our internal capital and liquidity risk parameters to highlight negative capital trends that could impact our ability for future growth payment of dividends to shareholders or other factors As noted previously correspondent bank providers of our daily federal funds purchased line of credit and the holding company operating line of credit use similar measures that impact our ability to continued use of those lines of credit if our level of nonperforming assets to capital were to rise above prescribed levels The following table presents the

originated by our lenders and sold to the FHLB and FNMA As a FHLB Mortgage Partnership Finance MPF loan servicer we provide a credit enhancement guarantee to reimburse the FHLB for foreclosure losses in excess of of the original loan principal sold to the FHLB prior to November Refer to Item Notes and of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the FHLB MPF program These first mortgage loans are underwritten using standardized criteria we consider to be conservative on residential properties in our local communities We believe loans serviced for the FHLB will realize minimal foreclosure losses in the future and that we will experience no loan losses related to charge offs in excess of the FHLB First Loss Account The north central Wisconsin residential real estate market is experiencing similar home value declines as the state of Wisconsin as a whole which are moderate when compared to other states in the country The average residential first mortgage originated by us under the FHLB program which required a credit enhancement was approximately in and during the last two years of the program Under bank regulatory capital rules this FHLB recourse

under the FHLB MPF programs for capital adequacy purposes was at December and and at December During October we ceased origination and sale of loans to the FHLB that required a credit enhancement and no additional risk based capital will be required to support such loans More information on all loans serviced for other investors including FHLB and FNMA is outlined in Table Other significant off balance sheet financial instruments include the various loan commitments outlined in Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon During we sold a new product that allowed certain adjustable rate commercial loan customers to fix their interest rate with an interest rate swap Refer to Item Note of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the program At December there were in interest rate swaps outstanding under the program Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing We service and of residential real estate loans which have been sold to the FHLB and FNMA at December and respectively Loans sold to FHLB and FNMA are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets An annualized servicing fee equal to of outstanding principal is retained from payments collected from the customer as compensation

and Loans in Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Mortgage loan servicing and credit enhancement fees have been an important source of mortgage banking income Because no further loans are sold to the FHLB with our credit enhancement we expect credit enhancement fees to decline in future years as this serviced principal is repaid Credit enhancements fees were in in and in Refer to Item Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of mortgage banking revenue We recognize a mortgage servicing right asset due to the substantial volume of loans serviced for the FHLB and FNMA Refer to Note of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our mortgage servicing right accounting policies Losses incurred by the FHLB on loans in the MPF program and the MPF program are absorbed by the FHLB in their First Loss Account If cumulative losses were to exceed the First Loss Account we would reimburse the FHLB for any excess losses up to the extent of our Credit Enhancement Guarantee Ten years after the original pool master commitment date the First Loss Account and the Credit Enhancement Guarantee are reset to current levels based on loans remaining in the pool These factors are further reset every subsequent five years until the pool is repaid During the MPF program reached its ten year anniversary and the First Loss Account and Credit Enhancement Guarantee associated with that program were reset to the new level shown in Table The next First Loss Account reset date for any individual master commitment containing our Credit Enhancement Guarantee is scheduled for August Due to historical strength of mortgage borrowers in our markets and relative stability of collateral home values and the original of principal First Loss Account provided by the FHLB we believe the possibility of losses under guarantees to the FHLB to be remote Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in only million of million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account Accordingly no provision for a recourse liability has been made for this recourse obligation on loans currently serviced by us Loans originated and sold to the FHLB under their XTRA program do not require credit enhancement and PSB has no risk of principal loss on such loans properly underwritten and sold Table of Contents All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations During we were required to repurchase a foreclosed loan and incur a loss related to underwriting violations related to private mortgage guarantee insurance We have reviewed our existing portfolio and believe we do not have continued risk for significant loss on other loans that could have this underwriting issue Other than this loan we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since and have never been required to repurchase a loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expect to be required to repurchase loans in the near term Table summarizes the various programs and investors for which we serviced loans as of December and Table Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing for Others At December

		<c><![CDATA[and Results of Operations Business Outlook Management expects revenues in fiscal to increase over fiscal year Expectations are for product mix and margins to remain favorable for fiscal year During fiscal new orders received by the Company were approximately million The order backlog of approximately million at June gives the Company a solid base of future sales It is presently anticipated that a minimum of million of orders comprising the June backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June The minimum of million does not include any shipments which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June See discussions below for further detail on the customer mix included in the backlog In addition to the backlog the Company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies transformers and subassemblies However there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally Two significant customers represented and of the Company s total sales in fiscal and respectively These sales are in connection with multiyear programs in which the Company is a significant subcontractor The June backlog of million includes orders from two customers that represent and of the total backlog A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company Historically a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company s total sales in any given fiscal year For several years management has pursued opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program and minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer Management continues to evaluate its business development functions and potential revised courses of action in order to diversify its customer base The Company currently has a very high concentration level with two customers and this presents significant risk Management along with the Board of Directors continues to evaluate the need and use of the Company s working capital Capital expenditures are expected to be app roximately for fiscal Expectations are that the working capital will be required to fund orders dividend payments and general operations of the business From time to time management along with the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee of the Board of Directors examine opportunities involving acquisitions or other strategic options including buying certain products or product lines The criteria for consideration are synergies with the Company s existing product base and accretion to earnings Results of Operations Net Sales for fiscal years ended June and were and respectively an increase This increase can be attributed to the contract specific nature of the Company s business and the timing of deliveries on these contracts More specifically shipments of power supplies increased by approximately million while transformers increased by approximately million For the fiscal years ended June and gross profits were and respectively Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent at and for fiscal and respectively The primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher as compared to products that are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts has a significant impact on gross profit and net income The increased gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales volume Employment of full time equivalents at June and June was people Selling general and administrative expenses were for the fiscal year ended June a decrease of or as compared to the prior year The decrease for fiscal relates primarily to a decrease in salary expense as well as relocation and transportation cost decreases Other income for the fiscal years ended June and was and respectively The increase is attributable higher sales of left over scrap metal The effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its qualified production activities under The American Jobs Creation Act of and the benefit derived from the dividends paid on allocated ESOP shares Net income for fiscal was or and per share basic and diluted respectively compared to net income of or and per share basic and diluted respectively for fiscal The increase in net income per share was primarily due to higher sales higher gross profit on sales and lower selling general and administrative expenses Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business and during the past two fiscal years the Company when possible has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years The Company s working capital as of June and was and respectively During the three months ended June and the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock During the fiscal year ended June and the Company repurchased and shares respectively of its common stock for a total purchase price of and respectively All shares were purchased from the Company s ESOP Under existing authorizations from the Company s Board of Directors as of June management is authorized to purchase an additional million of Company stock The table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal year indicated Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in provided by investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in net income the timing of the collection of accounts receivable purchase of inventory level of sales and payments of accounts payable Net cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and a decrease in proceeds from maturity of investment securities The decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary from cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its long term funding requirements for the foreseeable future Management believes that the Company s reserve for bad debts of is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business Historically bad debt expense has been minimal During fiscal year and fiscal the Company expended and respectively for plant improvements and new equipment The Company has budgeted approximately for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements We believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts Revenue Recognition and Estimates A significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts Generally revenues on long term fixed price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules Contract costs include material subcontract costs labor and an allocation of overhead costs The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above it is possible that materially different amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used based on changes in circumstances in the estimation process When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined changes are reflected in current period earnings ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[General The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which appear in Item of this Report Overview Revenues for fiscal increased by over fiscal however net earnings decreased by The decrease in earnings for the year is attributed to increased expenses needed to reorganize the Company s license operations in Mexico and full year expenses for an expanded sales staff The Company believes that these investments in staff will strengthen the Company and provide greater returns during fiscal Gross profit margins decreased slightly mostly due to product mix Foreign sales increased by Markets have begun to stabilize and new orders are trending higher As a result the Company expects to begin fiscal with an increased backlog Inventories at June were higher than at year end fiscal which were needed to support the higher incoming sales rate Cash decreased by to mostly due to the per share special dividend an aggregate of paid in December Prospects for fiscal appear favorable as the economy continues to improve and credit is becoming more available In August the Company received a number of large contracts on which the Company had submitted favorable bids These contracts which are scheduled to be shipped in fiscal have substantially increased the Company s subsequent backlog With a strong financial position and an experienced and reorganized sales staff the Company is hopeful it will improve its performance in fiscal Liquidity and Capital Resources For the twelve month period ended June cash decreased by compared to an increase of during fiscal The following table summarizes the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Years Ended June Net cash provided used by Operating activities Investing activities Financing activities For the twelve month period ended June operating activities provided cash of compared to of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily provided by the Company s net earnings of and non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of bad debt expenses of and a benefit of in deferred income taxes Additional cash was provided by a decrease in leases and mortgages receivables of and deferred income of These increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts and trade notes receivables of as shipments were heavy during the last month of fiscal and payments were not yet due Cash of was used to increase inventories to support new orders In addition a decrease of in accounts payable and accrued expenses represents early payments to vendors so that discounts could be realized Cash was also used to decrease accrued employee expenses by Income taxes payable and refundable income taxes used cash of Customer deposits decreased by due to shipments made in the third quarter from the Company s backlog while newer orders did not require deposits due to their smaller size Other assets used cash of in the normal course of business Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily provided by the Company s net earnings of and by an increase of in customer deposits The increase in customer deposits resulted from increased orders which trended higher than sales during the period Cash was also provided by non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of bad debts of and a benefit of in deferred income taxes Other changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash were increases in income taxes payable of and accrued employee expenses of and decreases in leases and mortgages receivable of and other current assets of The primary use of cash in fiscal was an increase in inventories of partially offset by a increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing unpaid invoices not yet due to support the increase in inventories Other uses of cash consisted of a increase in accounts and trade notes receivable and a reduction of in inventory reserves This reserve was placed against returned inventory in prior years which the Company resold during the first quarter of fiscal Investing activities used cash of and for the years ended June and respectively mostly for capital expenditures Financing activities used cash of in fiscal to pay dividends There were no expenditures in financing activities during fiscal The Company s original revolving line of credit facility expired on October Due to a change in ownership at the Company s former lender as a result of the acquisition of the former lender by a new lender a new line of credit facility was entered into on November The new credit facility provides a revolving line of credit that entitles the Company to borrow from time to time up to including a standby letter of credit sub facility for the purchase of inventory and a foreign exchange contract sub facility The Company s obligations under the new facility are guaranteed by the Company s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the Company s and its subsidiaries assets No amounts were outstanding under either facility at June and nor were there any amounts outstanding at any time during fiscal or The new facility requires maintenance of certain debt service coverage and leverage ratios and contained other restrictive covenants including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness pay dividends guarantee indebtedness of others grant liens sell assets and make investments The Company was in compliance with these covenants at June and The Company believes that its existing cash cash equivalents net cash from operations and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and to meet its long term liquidity needs Off Balance Sheet Financing The Company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements within the meaning of Item a of Regulation S K Results of Operations Year Ended June Net sales Development fees franchise and license fees commissions and other Total revenues Net sales for the year ended June increased by over fiscal For the twelve month period ended June equipment and parts sales increased by and respectively over fiscal attributable to a reorganized sales staff which enabled the Company to have greater penetration of its territory Although the economy is still unstable new orders have been trending higher increasing the Company s backlog at year end compared to During the year foreign sales also increased by Table of Contents Revenues of development fees franchising and license fees commission and other income increased by in fiscal when compared to fiscal The improvement can be attributed to the reorganization of our Mexican licensing operations and an increase in equipment restocking charges which offset a substantial commission received in fiscal on a sale by another distributor for an installation in the Company s territory Year Ended June As a percentage of net sales Cost of sales net As a percentage of revenues Selling general and administrative expenses Total expenses Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal The percentage varies slightly from year to year due to the mix of products sold Selling general and administrative expenses increased by in fiscal from fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenues to from The increase was mostly attributable to the increase in payroll expenses as a result of the reorganization and expansion of the sales staff Also contributing to the increase were stockholder expenses as the Company now must adhere to XBRL reporting requirements and professional fees Offsetting these increases in administrative expenses were decreases in office expenses service engineering and travel and entertainment expenses Interest income decreased by in fiscal from fiscal mostly due to lower prevailing interest rates The Company s effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal The slight variation in percentage reflects changes in both permanent and temporary adjustments to taxable income Inflation Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company s operations during any of the reported periods Transactions with Related Parties The Company leases square feet of warehouse and office space from the Sheila Steiner Revocable Trust The trustees of this trust are Sheila Steiner her husband William K Steiner and her son Michael S Steiner William K Steiner is Chairman of the Board of Directors and a director of the Company and Michael S Steiner is President and a director of the Company Michael Steiner individually is also a principal shareholder of the Company Annual rental expense under this lease was approximately in fiscal and in fiscal The lease was for an original three year term which commenced on November with two three year renewal options in favor of the Company The Company has exercised the second renewal option extending the lease until October The lease provides for annual rent increases commencing November of over the rent in the prior year The Company bears the cost of real estate taxes utilities maintenance non structural repairs and insurance The Company believes that the terms of the lease are comparable to terms that would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party for similar property in a similar locale In fiscal and the Company paid a law firm in which a director is Senior Counsel approximately and respectively for legal services performed Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Securities and Exchange Commission Financial Reporting Release No encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s financial statements Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities On an ongoing basis management evaluates these estimates including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable leases and mortgages the carrying value of inventories and long lived assets the timing of revenue recognition for initial license and franchise fees from sales of franchise arrangements and continuing license and franchise service fees as well as sales returns Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recognition of revenues and expenses and the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions Revenue Recognition and Accounts and Trade Notes Receivable Products are generally shipped Freight on Board FOB from the Company s warehouse or drop shipped from the Company s Vendor FOB at which time risk of loss and title passes to the purchaser Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of the arrangement delivery has occurred the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured In some cases the Company collects non income related taxes including sales and use tax from its customers and remits those taxes to governmental authorities The Company presents revenues net of these taxes Shipping delivery and handling fee income is included in revenues in the consolidated financial statements Shipping delivery and handling costs are included in cost of sales Commissions and development fees are recorded when earned generally when the services are performed or the transaction is closed Individual franchise arrangements include a license and provide for payment of initial fees as well as continuing royalties Initial franchise fees are generally recorded upon the opening of the franchised store which is evidenced by a certificate from the franchisee indicating that the store has opened and collectability is reasonably assured Continuing royalties represent regular contractual payments received for the use of the DRYCLEAN USA marks which are recognized as revenue when earned generally on a straight line basis Accounts and trade notes receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms The Company sells its products primarily to independent and franchise dry clean stores and chains laundry plants hotels motels cruise lines hospitals nursing homes government institutions and distributors The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and depending on the term of credit the amount of the credit granted and management s past history with a customer the Company may require the customer to grant a security interest in the purchased equipment as collateral for the receivable Senior management reviews accounts and trade notes receivable on a regular basis to determine if any such amounts will potentially be uncollectible The Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible along with a general reserve based on older aged amounts in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed the receivable is written off Based on the information available to management it believes the Company s allowance for doubtful accounts as of June and is adequate However actual write offs might exceed the recorded allowance Table of Contents Franchise License Trademark and Other Intangible Assets Franchise licenses trademarks patents and trade names are stated at cost less accumulated amortization Those assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited years Patents are amortized over the shorter of the patents useful life or legal life from the date such patents are granted The Company reviews the recoverability of intangible assets based primarily upon an analysis of undiscounted cash flows from the intangible assets In the event the expected future net cash flows should become less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss will be recorded in the period the determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets Income Taxes The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic Income Taxes ASC Under the asset and liability method of ASC deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled Under ASC the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date If it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is recognized Significant judgment is required in developing the Company s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets Management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely that the asset will not be realized The Company follows ASC Topic Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes The Company does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax benefits related to certain tax positions taken on its various income tax returns The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U S federal and state authorities for the years through Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance In January the FASB issued ASU Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ASU ASU amends ASC Topic and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and Level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy including the reasons for and the

our fiscal year and the third quarter of our fiscal year and revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants caused by our increasing our bar liquor prices during the third quarter of our fiscal year Restaurant Food Sales Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food including non alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled for our fiscal year as compared to for our

of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled for our fiscal year as compared to for our fiscal year an increase of or The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales which includes all nine Company owned package liquor stores was for our fiscal year as compared to for our fiscal year Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses consisting of cost of merchandise sold payroll and related costs occupancy costs and selling general and administrative expenses for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year The increase was primarily due to the costs related to our new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December the shopping center in Miami Florida acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year and to an expected general increase in food costs including an increase in the cost of poultry offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance to our units and actions taken by management to reduce and or control costs and expenses We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year for the same reasons Operating costs and expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales to approximately in our fiscal year from in our fiscal year Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales Restaurant Food and Bar Sales Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year increased to from for our fiscal year Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales was for our fiscal year and for our fiscal year We anticipate that our gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease during our fiscal year due to higher food costs including our cost of poultry offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year Package Liquor Store Sales Gross profit for package liquor store sales for our fiscal year decreased to from for our fiscal year Our gross profit margin calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales for package liquor store sales was for our fiscal year and for our fiscal year The decrease in our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales during our fiscal year was due to our inability to purchase close out and inventory reduction merchandise from wholesalers which we were able to obtain during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year We anticipate that our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year Payroll and Related Costs Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year due primarily to an increase in the Florida minimum wage which was effective January and to increases in payroll taxes including unemployment taxes We anticipate that our payroll and related costs will increase throughout our fiscal year due primarily to payroll associated with the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total sales was in our fiscal year and of total sales in our fiscal year Occupancy Costs Occupancy costs consisting of rent common area maintenance repairs real property taxes and amortization of leasehold interests for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year Our occupancy costs increased primarily due to increasing percentage rents at various locations and due to rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership which commenced January partially offset by the elimination of rent from a limited partnership owned restaurant located in the shopping center in Miami Florida which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year and the elimination of rent paid for our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at Biscayne Boulevard North Miami Florida the real property and building of which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year We anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year as rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami Florida will be offset by the reduction in rental payments as a result of our purchase of the building on November where Store is located Table of Contents Selling General and Administrative Expenses Selling general and administrative expenses consisting of general corporate expenses including but not limited to advertising insurance professional costs clerical and administrative overhead for our fiscal year increased or to from for our fiscal year Selling general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales in our fiscal year to as compared to in our fiscal year We anticipate that our selling general and administrative expenses will increase throughout our fiscal year due primarily to the new restaurant location in Miami Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year and opened for business on December the shopping center acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year and increases across all categories Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for our fiscal year decreased or to from for our fiscal year As a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expense was of revenue for our fiscal year and of revenue for our fiscal year Interest Expense Net Interest expense for our fiscal year increased to from for our fiscal year I nterest expense increased during our fiscal year primarily due to the interest paid on the million mortgage loan the proceeds of which we used to purchase a shopping center in Miami Florida and a million term loan the proceeds of which were also ultimately used to purchase the shopping center while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves Net Income Attributable to Stockholders Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year decreased or to from for our fiscal year As a percentage of sales net income for our fiscal year is as compared to in our fiscal year During our fiscal year we recognized income of offset by income tax of from the sale of our interest as guarantor of a nine year leasehold interest Without giving effect to the above non recurring item our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year would have increased or to for our fiscal year Table of Contents New Limited Partnership Restaurants As new restaurants open our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations During our fiscal year we recognized pre opening rent expense in the approximate amount of for the Miami Florida restaurant which opened for business on December During our fiscal year we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening rent We are recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease During our fiscal year the limited partnership restaurant in Miami Florida which opened for business on December reported losses of primarily due to pre opening costs thus contributing to a reduction in the operating income for our fiscal year During our fiscal year we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening costs We believe that our current cash on hand together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months Trends During the next twelve months we expect that our restaurant food and bar sales will increase but gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease due to higher food costs including our cost of poultry offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year We anticipate that our package liquor store sales and gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year We expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income W e also plan to continue our increased advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition With our recent menu price increases we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses which will adversely affect our net income We may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible We currently have a new restaurant in the development stage which opened for business on December using our limited partnership ownership model We continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business Any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model We are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available we will consider it Liquidity and Capital Resources We fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations As of September we had cash of approximately an increase of from our cash balance of as of October The increase in cash as of September was primarily due to a balance of of net proceeds from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami Florida restaurant and opened for business on December Management believes that the Company s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months Table of Contents Cash Flows Fiscal Years in thousands Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities Net increase decrease in cash and equivalents Cash and equivalents beginning of year Cash and equivalents end of year Capital Expenditures In addition to using cash for our operating expenses we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants We acquired property and equipment of including of which was financed and of

During our fiscal year we acquired property and equipment of including of which was financed and of deposits recorded in other assets as of October during our fiscal year including for renovations to one existing Company owned restaurant All of our owned units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive The cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year was for renovations to one existing Company owned restaurant and for renovations to three limited partnership owned restaurants We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year will be approximately which funds will be provided from operations Table of Contents Debt As of the end of our fiscal year we had debt of as compared to as of the end of our fiscal year As of September we are in compliance with the covenants of all loans with our lender We repaid long term debt including auto loans financed insurance premiums and mortgages in the amount of and in our fiscal years and respectively Financed

entered into a purchase agreement with a new rib supplier whereby we agreed to purchase approximately of baby back ribs during calendar year from this vendor at a fixed cost While we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor we believe there are several other alternative vendors available if needed Purchase of Limited Partnership Interests During our fiscal year we purchased from one limited partner who is not an officer director or family member of officers or directors a limited partnership interest of in one limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of During our fiscal year we purchased from one limited partner who is not an officer director or family member of officers or directors a limited partnership interest of in one limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of Working capital The table below summarizes our current assets current liabilities and working capital for our fiscal years and Table of Contents Sept Oct in thousands Current assets Current liabilities Working capital Our working capital as of September increased by from working capital as of October Our working capital increased during our fiscal year from our working capital for our fiscal year ended October primarily due to the net funds remaining from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami Florida restaurant While there can be no assurance due to among other things unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues or both we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year including payment for a new point of sale system for our restaurants Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note to our consolidated financial statements located in Item of this Annual Report on Form K The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment The estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material In addition periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering among other things expected use life of the lease on the building and warranty period if applicable The assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary Table of Contents Consolidation of Limited Partnerships As of September we operate eight restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner This new restaurant opened for business on December Additionally we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening additional new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding As a result of these controlling interests we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation The noncontrolling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share Income Taxes FASB ASC Topic Income Taxes requires among other things recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year Other Matters Impact of Inflation The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food beverage and labor costs A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs To date inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise Table of Contents Risk As part of our ongoing operations we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings As more fully described in Note Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form K we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations At September we had four variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates In July we converted the amount outstanding on our line of credit to a term loan the Term Loan and we also re financed the mortgage loan encumbering our corporate offices the Refinanced Mortgage Loan In November we financed our purchase of the real property and two building shopping center in Miami Florida with a mortgage loan the M Mortgage Loan and received a term loan the M Term Loan the proceeds of which were ultimately used to purchase the shopping center while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves As a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments we entered into interest rate swap agreements with our unrelated third party lender to convert these variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates We are currently party to the following four interest rate swap agreements i One interest rate swap agreement entered into in July relates to the Term Loan the Term Loan Swap which converts the LIBOR based variable rate interest to a fixed rate The Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a three year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at the British Bankers Association LIBOR LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount Under this method of accounting at September we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender t he fair value of the Term Loan Swap was not significant and ii The second interest rate swap agreement entered into July relates to the Refinanced Mortgage Loan the Mortgage Loan Swap The Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Daily Floating Rate plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount Under this method of accounting at September we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender t he fair value of the Mortgage Loan Swap was not significant and iii The third interest rate swap agreement entered into in November by our wholly owned subsidiary Flanigan s Calusa Center LLC relates to the Mortgage Loan the M Mortgage Loan Swap The M Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for an eight year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Month plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount We determined that at September the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material and Table of Contents iv The fourth interest rate swap agreement entered into in November relates to the M Term Loan the M Term Loan Swap The M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR Month plus on the same amortizing notional principal amount We determined that at September the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material At September our cash resources earn interest at variable rates Accordingly our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates There is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations ]]></c>

Customer Location Liquidity Capital Resources and Other Financial Information Environmental Inflation Recently Issued Accounting Standards Outlook Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors In third quarter the Company s Board of Directors declared a two for one split of the Company s common stock distributed October in the form of a percent stock dividend All shares and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted for all periods presented for the stock split For additional information see Note Stockholders Equity to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP the Company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities On an ongoing basis the Company evaluates its estimates including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts impairment of long lived assets environmental costs U S pension and other post employment benefits litigation and contingent liabilities income taxes and purchase accounting The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions The Company s management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company s financial condition and results These estimates require management s most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments The Company believes based on historical results the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results is low However if one of the Company s key customers was to file for bankruptcy or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments or there was a significant slow down in the economy the Company could increase its allowances This could result in a material charge to earnings The Company s allowances were million and million at December and respectively Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable an analysis of fair value is triggered An impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year unless events warrant more frequent testing Reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill The carrying value of indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products is less than their carrying value If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill additional steps including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit would be necessary to determine the amount if any of goodwill impairment Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Coatings Adhesives Specialty Polymers and Inks CASPI and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates PCI segments The Company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Beaumont Texas industrial gasification project In fourth quarter the Company announced the discontinuance of the Beaumont Texas industrial gasification project which resulted in an impairment of the Beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets As the Company s assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change additional write downs may be required in the future If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted resulting in a charge to earnings The Company recognized a definite lived intangible asset impairment charge of million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont Texas industrial gasification project The Company recognized fixed tangible asset impairment charges of million and goodwill and definite lived intangible asset impairment charges of million in results from continuing operations during related to the discontinuance of the Beaumont Texas industrial gasification project MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range the Company accrues the minimum amount This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site the nature of the remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in health safety environmental and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at December In accordance with GAAP the Company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains Environmental assets as defined by GAAP include but are not limited to waste management units such as landfills water treatment facilities and ash ponds When these types of assets are constructed or installed a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets Currently the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to years If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease In accordance with GAAP the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs The Company s reserve including the above remediation was million at December and million at December representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs Pension and Other Post employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits Additionally Eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance health care and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees eligible survivors The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates and expected return on plan assets In connection with its acquisition of Sterling Chemicals Inc Sterling in the Company assumed Sterling s U S pension plans At December the Company assumed discount rates of percent and percent on the defined benefit pension plans respectively and an expected return on plan assets of percent and percent respectively The Company assumed a discount rate of percent on its other post employment benefit plan The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements mortality turnover and plan participation MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The December projected benefit obligation and expense are affected by year end assumptions The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company s long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for all U S pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted They also may not be additive so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown Change in Assumption Impact on Pre tax U S Benefits Expense Impact on December Projected Benefit Obligation for U S Pension Plans Impact on December Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation for Other U S Postretirement Plans basis point decrease in discount rate Million Million Million basis point increase in discount rate Million Million Million basis point decrease in expected return on assets Million No Impact N A basis point increase in expected return on assets Million No Impact N A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Company s pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each December The expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds primarily the domestic international private equity and real estate markets Historically over a ten year period excluding which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession the Company s average achieved actual return has been near the expected return on assets The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds which are used to develop a yield curve This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations As future benefits under the U S benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years If actual experience differs from these long term assumptions the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease The charges applied to earnings in and due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates were million million and million respectively MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during However an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders equity as of December for the impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates if any While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates actual returns on plan assets retirement attrition rates of employees and other factors For further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations see Note Retirement Plans to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings including product liability personal injury asbestos patent and intellectual property commercial contract environmental antitrust health and safety and employment matters which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range the Company accrues the minimum amount The Company expenses legal costs including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency as incurred Based upon facts and information currently available the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters however results of operations could be affected by monetary damages costs or expenses and charges against earnings in particular periods Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized In the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position As of December a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision Purchase Accounting In general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition The Company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets Management s judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives for property plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets and can materially affect the Company s results of operations MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTATION OF NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Company and segment operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains described below Company earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs described below Cash flows from operating activities

business results and the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs to improve the profitability of the Company and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost Eastman s management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results respectively without the identified items In addition management believes that cash provided by and used in operating activities should be considered both with and without the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the tax payment for the gain on the sale of the PET business and dividends and capital expenditures Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation These measures excluding the identified items are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of billion and billion for and respectively Sales revenue increases were primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs primarily for propane paraxylene and wood pulp The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines the fourth quarter restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview Texas facility and strengthened end use demand primarily for CASPI segment products The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased

expansions and a full year of depreciation on assets from acquisitions completed in including Sterling Other Commitments At December the Company s obligations related to outstanding indebtedness in the form of notes and debentures totaled approximately billion to be paid over a period of approximately years MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company had various purchase obligations at December totaling approximately billion over a period of approximately years for materials supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable noncancelable and month to month operating leases totaling million over a period of several years Of the total lease commitments approximately percent relate to machinery and equipment including computer and communications equipment and production equipment approximately percent relate to real property including office space storage facilities and land and approximately percent relate to railcars In addition the Company had other liabilities at December totaling approximately billion related primarily to pension retiree medical other post employment obligations and environmental reserves The obligations described above are summarized in the following table Dollars in millions Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities a Total b and beyond Total a Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates health care cost trends actual returns on plan assets retirement and attrition rates of employees continuation or modification of the benefit plans and other factors Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company b Not included in the above table is the expected payment of approximately billion in cash in order to complete the Solutia acquisition or any obligations to be assumed upon completion of the acquisition of Solutia Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss if any incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets Under these operating leases the residual value guarantees at December totaled million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft Leases with guarantee amounts totaling million and million will expire in and and beyond respectively The Company believes based on current facts and circumstances that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote As described in Note Equity Investments to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report Eastman has a percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastman s Kingsport Tennessee plant This investment is accounted for under the equity method Eastman s net investment in the joint venture at December and was approximately million and million respectively which was comprised of the recognized portion of the venture s accumulated deficits long term amounts owed to Primester and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships including special purpose entities for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes Thus Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships The accounting guidance on consolidation of Variable Interest Entities VIEs is effective for all VIEs or potential VIEs the Company is involved with on or after January This guidance amended the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not VIEs or in the case of Primester a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company s Kingsport Tennessee plant the Company has shared control of the VIE As such the Company is not required to consolidate these entities Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers customers and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur Non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products intellectual property and environmental matters and other indemnifications The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims However while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or liquidity Treasury Stock On October the Company distributed a two for one split of the Company s common stock in the form of a percent stock dividend For additional information see Note Stockholders Equity to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report on Form K In October the Company s Board of Directors authorized million for repurchase of the Company s outstanding common stock The Company completed the million repurchase authorization in November acquiring a total of million shares In August the Company s Board of Directors authorized million for the repurchase of the Company s outstanding common The Company completed the million repurchase authorization in June acquiring a total of million shares In February the Company s Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to million of the Company s outstanding common stock at such times in such amounts and on such terms as determined to be in the best interests of the Company As of December a total of shares of common stock have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately million During the Company repurchased shares of common stock for a cost of approximately million Dividends The Company s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in first and second quarters and per share in third and fourth quarters for a total of per share in The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of per share in first second and third quarters and per share in fourth quarter for a total of per share in and per share for all quarters for a total of per share in The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of per share during the first quarter of payable on April to stockholders of record on March MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment storage transportation and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites the Company along with many other entities has been designated a potentially responsible party PRP by the U S Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs In addition the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman s policies as described in Note Significant Accounting Policies to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report Because of expected sharing of costs the availability of legal defenses and the Company s preliminary assessment of actions that may be required management does not believe that the Company s liability for these environmental matters individually or in the aggregate will be material to the Company s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range the Company accrues the minimum amount This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site the nature of the remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in health safety environmental and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at December In addition to remediation activities the Company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units such as landfills water treatment facilities and ash ponds When these types of assets are constructed or installed a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets The best estimate accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is million at December GAAP requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation CARO when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated The Company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of December Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities including but not limited to the potential for asbestos abatement activities the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations as well as any new ones that may develop and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental asset retirement obligations accounted for approximately percent of the total environmental reserve at December Currently the Company s environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next years If the Company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets or these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would the amortization on them would increase and could have a material negative impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote and does not anticipate based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary The Company s cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were million million and million in and respectively These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities but also included million in expenditures for engineering and construction in Cash expenditures in are expected to increase primarily as a result of full year integration of acquisitions and of the expected mid acquisition of Solutia although no assurances of the timing of completion of this acquisition or the related cash expenditures can be provided Other than potential capital expenditures at the Company s Kingsport Tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers the Company does not currently expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Company s planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities although no assurances can be provided as to the timing or amount of any capital expenditures that may arise as a result of the completion of the expected acquisition of Solutia Potential capital expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on final regulation requirements and the Company s method of addressing those requirements INFLATION In recent years general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman s costs The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price although derivative financial instruments were utilized as appropriate to mitigate short term market price fluctuations The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit For additional information see Note Derivatives to the Company s consolidated financial statements in Part II Item of this Annual Report RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures with the purpose of converging the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December The guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement requirements along with amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurements and disclosures The Company has concluded that the new guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Earnings Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings Consolidated Statements of Financial Position or related disclosures MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In June the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to presentation of comprehensive income The standards update is intended to help financial statement users better understand the causes of an entity s change in financial position and results of operation It is effective for reporting periods beginning after December The amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity The amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements The FASB amended this guidance in December to postpone a requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented and reinstate previous guidance related to such reclassifications Upon adoption the Company will continue to present components of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations In December the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued amended accounting guidance to enhance disclosure requirements for instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its disclosures Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations OUTLOOK The Company expects to benefit from the strength of its businesses based on modest global economic growth and aided by the full year integration of acquisitions including Sterling and Scandiflex The Company expects the volatility of market prices for raw materials and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility The Company expects to continue with growth initiatives in all segments as well as to continue to explore and invest in R D initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability consumerism and energy efficiency through high performance materials advanced cellulosics and environmentally friendly chemistry The Company expects to complete the acquisition of Solutia mid This acquisition is subject to approval by Solutia s shareholders receipt of required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions Excluding the impact of the expected acquisition of Solutia the Company expects capital spending to be between million and million for organic growth initiatives and maintenance and between million and million of free cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends Assuming mid completion of the Solutia acquisition the Company expects full year diluted earnings per share in to be approximately excluding acquisition related costs and charges See Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors below MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under Outlook and certain other statements in this Annual Report which are not statements of historical fact may be forward looking statements as defined in and subject to the protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of and other federal securities laws These statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to among other things such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization anticipated capital spending expected depreciation and amortization environmental matters

mentioned with the specific statements Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends management expectations plans and strategies economic conditions and other factors These plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of any proposed acquisitions and the timing or actual achievement of expected benefits from integration plans relating to and expected synergies from acquired businesses Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report the following are the most significant known factors that could cause the Company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statement Additional factors not presently known to the Company or that the Company does not currently believe to be material may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations Adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company While economic and financial market conditions have improved from those in and continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets particularly in Europe may adversely affect the Company s results of operations financial condition and cash flows The Company s business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent global recession including the credit market crisis declining consumer and business confidence fluctuating commodity prices volatile exchange rates and other challenges that affected the global economy If the global economy or financial markets again deteriorate or experience significant new disruptions the Company s results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the Company s ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained which may negatively impact the Company s liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools including hedging as appropriate to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations In addition natural disasters plant interruptions changes in laws or regulations war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities The Company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure Significant limitation of the Company s ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company s sales revenue costs results of operations and financial condition Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures or external factors such as natural disasters pandemic illness changes in laws or regulations war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism cyber attacks or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company s largest customers could adversely affect our financial results The Company has an extensive customer base however loss of or material financial weakness of certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal or organic development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses These growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies expansion into new markets and geographic regions and alliances ventures and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company s portfolio of businesses and capabilities There can be no assurance that such efforts investments or acquisitions and alliances including integration of acquired businesses will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company s results of operations There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions expected benefits of proposed acquisitions integration plans and expected synergies therefrom There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due among other things to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The pending acquisition of Solutia exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties both before and after its completion the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company s business financial condition and results of operations In connection with Eastman s agreement to complete the acquisition of Solutia and during its pendency the Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman These risks include but are not limited to that the Company may not complete the acquisition of Solutia on terms contained in the merger agreement which could impact the purchase price to be paid assets to be acquired covenants relating to Eastman s or Solutia s operations or timing thereof that the Company may continue to incur significant additional costs and expend significant additional time and effort prior to the closing and if the transaction is delayed or not consummated the Company may not be able to realize any benefit therefrom that the Company may not be able to obtain the financing it intends to obtain in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia and that Solutia can require Eastman to complete the acquisition in certain situations that could result in the Company incurring significant additional costs In the event the Company does complete the acquisition of Solutia it may become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman These risks and uncertainties include that the Company will be required to incur substantial additional indebtedness in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia may not be able to achieve the cost revenue or tax synergies expected from the acquisition of Solutia or there may be delays in achieving any such synergies and may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate Solutia s businesses into Eastman s Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Company s future compliance costs The Company s facilities and businesses are subject to complex health safety and environmental laws and regulations which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations The Company s accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based The amount accrued reflects the Company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site the nature of the remedy the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in health safety environmental chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher costs Pending and proposed U S Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Company s manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy which legislation and regulation if enacted may result in capital expenditures increases in costs for raw materials and energy limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices and other direct compliance costs In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company there may be other factors not currently known to the Company which could in the future materially adversely affect the Company its business financial condition or results of operations The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance This disclosure including that under Outlook and Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time represents management s best judgment as of the date the information is given The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by law Investors are advised however to consult any further public Company disclosures such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases on related subjects Eastman Chemical Company Eastman or the Company has exposure to market risks from changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations To mitigate the Company s exposure to these market risks Eastman has established policies procedures and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and or commodity prices The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements From time to time to manage the Company s mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount At December and these borrowings investments and swaps were predominately U S dollar denominated The nature and amount of the Company s long term and short term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements market conditions and other factors For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates At December and the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately million and million respectively This exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates The Company s operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk the Company from time to time enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures It is the Company s policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes At December the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the U S dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million with an additional million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates At December the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the U S dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million with an additional million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates Since the Company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy To mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities principally propane natural gas and ethane the Company enters into option and forward contracts At December the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent was million with less than an additional million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter At December the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent was million with less than an additional million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle as well as tradesmen and small businesses We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply com Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise Equine pet and small animal products including items necessary for their health care growth and containment Hardware truck towing and tool products Seasonal products including lawn and garden items power equipment gifts and toys Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use and Work recreational clothing and footwear We operated retail farm and ranch stores in states as of December Given the size of the communities that we target we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores inclusive of recently identified small market locations Approximately of our stores are in freestanding buildings and are located in strip shopping centers Fiscal was once again a year of strong performance for our Company We achieved double digit increases in both sales and earnings on top of last year s record results In fiscal our net revenues increased to billion compared to billion in fiscal and we increased our fiscal diluted earnings per share to versus in fiscal We also ended the year with million in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately We plan to open to new stores in a selling square footage increase of approximately We opened new stores in and new stores in a square footage increase of approximately and respectively Our current and long term growth strategy is to expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores enhance financial performance through same store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation a strong private label offering and optimization of product pricing transportation and distribution costs leverage operating costs especially advertising distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers online experience and expand through selective acquisition as such opportunities arise to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth Our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures limited maintenance capital and low occupancy and operating costs The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in was approximately million A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures principally leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment and approximately for pre opening costs Our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years Our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs Our capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million respectively We expect capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million as we continue to invest in new store growth existing stores distribution center capacity and information technology We place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings Modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers We believe these efforts coupled with a strong marketing program and in depth product knowledge training of our store team members have enhanced our sales and financial performance Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities Our financial position and or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note to our Consolidated Financial Statements The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Inventory Valuation Inventory Impairment We identify potentially excess and slow moving inventory by evaluating turn rates historical and expected future sales trends age of merchandise overall inventory levels current cost of inventory and other benchmarks The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value i e an inability to realize the full carrying value is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term However changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment However if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material A change in our impairment reserve at December would have affected net income by approximately in fiscal Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts The reserve is established by assessing the chain wide average shrinkage experience rate applied to the related periods sales volumes Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve However if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material A change in our shrinkage reserve at December would have affected net income by approximately in fiscal Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor s product Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold During interim periods the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels sales trends and expected customer demand as well as planned new store openings and relocations Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods it is possible that actual year end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand purchasing activity target thresholds vendor attrition and collectibility We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented At the end of each fiscal year a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known Thus we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal If a reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December net income would have been affected by approximately million Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support if such a reduction were to occur in future periods the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories on an aggregate basis and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented If a increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance net income would have been affected by approximately million Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Self Insurance Reserves We self insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance workers compensation and general liability insurance plans We have stop loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values When estimating our self insured liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience demographic factors and severity factors The full extent of certain claims especially workers compensation and general liability claims may not become fully determined for several years Our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insurance reserves in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves However if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims we may be exposed to losses that could be material A change in our self insurance reserves at December would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal Sales Tax Audit Reserve A portion of our sales are to tax exempt customers We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations there can be no assurance that we upon final completion of such audits would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non compliance Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results changes in policies preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural based exemptions the ambiguity in state tax regulations the number of ongoing audits and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities Our sales tax audit assessment methodology remained materially consistent in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve However if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material A change in our sales tax audit reserve at December would have affected net income by approximately in fiscal Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Tax Contingencies Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U S federal and state tax authorities These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions At any time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution A change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December would have affected net income by approximately in fiscal Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Impairment of Long Lived Assets Long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets which are separately tested for impairment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable When evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges The evaluation for long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows which is generally the individual store level The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations including margin on net sales payroll and related items occupancy costs insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value If we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis For a depreciable long lived asset the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive and a change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis However if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each

certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales Net sales Cost of merchandise sold a Gross margin a Selling general and administrative expenses a Depreciation and amortization Operating income Interest expense net Income before income taxes Income tax provision Net income a Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling general and administrative SG A expenses refer to Note Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form K Fiscal Compared to Fiscal Net sales increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal Fiscal included an additional week compared to fiscal representing approximately basis points of the net sales increase Same store sales for fiscal were billion an increase over fiscal This compares to a same store sales increase in the prior year The same store transaction count increased while same store average ticket increased for fiscal The same store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable usable and edible C U E products principally animal and pet related merchandise Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast We estimate that same store sales were favorably impacted by approximately basis points due to inflation principally in key C U E categories Additionally fiscal had one additional comp sales day in the year which had a favorable impact on same store sales of approximately basis points Store growth was approximately a net increase of stores since December Non comp sales defined as stores opened less than one year for fiscal were million a increase over total fiscal net sales Non comp sales for fiscal were million a increase over total fiscal net sales In fiscal we opened new stores compared to new stores in fiscal relocated three stores compared to no relocations in fiscal and closed one store compared to three closed stores in fiscal The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal and Percent of Sales Product Category Livestock and Pet Hardware Tools and Truck Seasonal Gift and Toy Products Clothing and Footwear Agriculture Total Gross margin increased to billion compared to billion in As a percent of sales gross margin increased basis points to for fiscal compared to for fiscal The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin partially offset by increased transportation costs Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management strategic sourcing private branding and price optimization We expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal Additionally we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases However we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management As a percent of sales SG A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal The SG A improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs Total SG A expenses for fiscal increased to billion from million in fiscal The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth variable costs associated with our same store sales performance increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system The Company s new Franklin Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of Our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal compared to fiscal As a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal increased to million or per diluted share as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal During we repurchased approximately million shares of stock at a total cost of million as part of our previously announced billion share repurchase program In we repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of million Fiscal Compared to Fiscal Net sales increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal Same store sales for fiscal were billion a increase over fiscal This compares to a same store sales decrease in the prior year The same store transaction count increased while same store average ticket decreased for fiscal The same store sales increase was broad based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories principally animal and pet related products as well as seasonal products including heating insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment New store growth was approximately or net stores opened since December Non comp sales for fiscal were million a increase over total fiscal net sales Non comp sales for fiscal were million a increase

Tools and Truck Seasonal Gift and Toy Products Clothing and Footwear Agriculture Total Gross margin increased to billion compared to billion in As a percent of sales gross margin increased basis points to for fiscal compared to for fiscal The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink partially offset by increased transportation costs The direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing inventory management and more effective pricing As a percent of sales SG A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal The SG A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same store sales and expense management partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense Total SG A expenses increased to million from million in fiscal The increase in SG A expense primarily reflects new store growth variable costs associated with our same store sales growth and increased incentive compensation Our effective tax rate decreased to for fiscal compared to in fiscal This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal compared to fiscal As a result of the foregoing factors net income for fiscal increased to million or per diluted share as compared to net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal During we repurchased approximately million shares of stock at a total cost of million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program In we repurchased approximately million shares at a total cost of million Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion remodeling and relocation programs including inventory purchases and capital expenditures distribution center capacity and improvements information technology share repurchases and cash dividends Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances funds provided from operations borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement capital and operating leases and normal trade credit Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold weather selling seasons respectively Working Capital At December we had working capital of million a million increase from December This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities in millions Variance Current assets Cash and cash equivalents Restricted cash Short term investments Inventories Prepaid expenses and other current assets Deferred income taxes Current liabilities Accounts payable Accrued employee compensation Other accrued expenses Current portion of capital lease obligation Income taxes payable Deferred income taxes Working capital In comparison to prior year end working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory partially offset by a decrease in cash The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation Average inventory per store increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures principally due to the construction of a new distribution center Borrowings and Credit Facilities Through October we were party to a Senior Credit Facility the Credit Agreement which provided for borrowings up to million with sublimits of million and million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for million subject to additional lender group commitments The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February On October we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to million with sublimits of million and million for letters of credit and swingline loans respectively This agreement is unsecured and matures in October with proceeds available to be used for working capital capital expenditures dividends share repurchases and other matters At December and December there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility There were million and million outstanding letters of credit as of December and December respectively Borrowings bear interest at either the bank s base rate at December or the London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR at December plus an additional amount ranging from to per annum adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio at December We are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from to per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio for unused capacity at December There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization stock compensation and rent expense consolidated EBITDAR to the sum of interest paid and rental expense excluding straight line rent The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense excluding straight line rent multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness capital expenditures business operations guarantees investments mergers consolidations and sales of assets transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates and liens We were in compliance with all covenants at December Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company s common stock and payment of common stock dividends The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years in millions Net cash provided by operating activities Net cash used in investing activities Net cash used in financing activities Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents Operating Activities The million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions Variance Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock compensation expense Deferred income taxes Inventories and accounts payable Prepaid expenses and other current assets Accrued expenses Income taxes payable Other net Net cash provided by operations Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments The increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors The million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities in millions Variance Net income Depreciation and amortization Stock compensation expense Deferred income taxes Inventories and accounts payable Prepaid expenses and other current assets Accrued expenses Income taxes payable Other net Net cash provided by operations The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory net of accounts payable and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable The increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal but not paid until fiscal The decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors Investing Activities Investing activities used million million and million in fiscal and respectively The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures Our significant store expansion coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure resulted in the following capital expenditures in millions Distribution center capacity and improvements New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened Purchase of previously leased and self developed stores Existing stores Information technology Corporate and other The above table reflects new stores and three relocations in fiscal compared to new stores during fiscal We also purchased of our existing lease stores during fiscal compared to four existing stores in fiscal The increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in Franklin Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers Our long term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between million and million in fiscal We plan to open approximately five to more stores in fiscal compared to While we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal we estimate to spend approximately million on our distribution center network principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements Additionally we plan to invest approximately million in information technology upgrades including point of sale system enhancements continued roll out of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers an upgrade of our e commerce site and store and store support center hardware refreshes Financing Activities Financing activities used million million and million in fiscal and respectively The cash used by financing activities in fiscal was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share based compensation On April the Company s Board of Directors authorized a million increase to the existing share repurchase program bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of billion of common stock exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases through April The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements capital availability and other market conditions Repurchased shares will be held in treasury The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice We repurchased approximately million million and million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of million million and million in fiscal and respectively Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance As of December we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of million exclusive of any fees commissions or other expenses In the second quarter of fiscal we increased our quarterly dividend from per share to per share We paid dividends totaling million and million in fiscal and respectively We believe that our existing cash balances expected cash flow from future operations borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs including new store openings store acquisitions relocations and renovations and distribution center capacity over the next several years Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December in thousands Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Obligations Less than year years years More than years Operating leases Capital leases Purchase obligations Capital lease obligations include related interest The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal as well as the purchase of a previously leased store At December there were million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash The letter of credit outside the Senior Credit Facility will automatically increase by million in the first quarter of fiscal bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to million Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit The balances for these arrangements are discussed above We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory primarily sourced overseas in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic Testing Goodwill for Impairment The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount qualitative assessment If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount an entity would not be required to perform the existing two step impairment test The amendments to Topic are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements Interest Rate Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank s base rate at both December and December or LIBOR and at December and December respectively plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly ranging from to at December and to at December based on our leverage ratio and at December and December respectively We are also required to pay quarterly in arrears a commitment fee ranging from to at December and to at December based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line at December and December Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal Historically our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products Unseasonable weather excessive precipitation drought and early or late frosts may also affect our sales We believe however that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold weather selling season Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services which include among other items steel grain petroleum corn cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services Therefore we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost which may impact consumer demand and as a result sales and gross margin Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs economies of scale from increased volume of purchases adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality Due to the competitive environment such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance ]]></c>
