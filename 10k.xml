The following table sets forth, as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented, revenues related to each of (i) technology fees, (ii) facility management, (iii) products and services:                                                  For the Year Ended December 31,    2011 2010 Technology fees     0.1%     0.1% Facility management   68.3%   66.2% Products and services   31.6%   33.7% Totals 100.0% 100.0%   Technology fee revenue is defined as:  royalty revenue, which represent ongoing amounts received from licensees for continued use of the N-Viro Process and are typically based on volumes of sludge processed;  license and territory fees, which represent non-recurring payments for the right to use the N-Viro Process in a specified geographic area or at a particular N-Viro facility;  and research and development revenue, which represent payments from federal and state agencies awarded to us to fund ongoing site-specific research utilizing the N-Viro technology. Facility management revenues are recognized under contracts where we manage the N-Viro Process ourselves to treat sludge, pursuant to a fixed price contract. Product and service revenue is defined as:  alkaline admixture revenue, which represent ongoing payments from licensees arising from the sale and distribution of alkaline admixture by us to N-Viro facilities;  service fee revenue for the management of alkaline admixture, which represent fees charged by us to manage and sell the alkaline admixture on behalf of a third party customer;  N-Viro Soil TM sales, which represent revenue received from sales of N-Viro Soil   sold by us;  commissions earned on sales of equipment to an N-Viro facility;  rental of equipment to a licensee or agent;  and equipment sales, which represent the price charged for equipment held for subsequent sale. Our policy is to record the revenues payable to us pursuant to agency and license agreements when we have fulfilled our obligations under the relevant contract, except when it pertains to a foreign license agreement.  In the case of foreign licenses, revenue is recorded when cash is received and when we have fulfilled our obligations under the relevant foreign license agreement.   Results of Operations The following tables set forth, for the periods presented, (i) certain items in the Combined Statement of Operations, (ii) the percentage change of each such item from period to period and (iii) each such item as a percentage of total revenues in each period presented. (Dollars in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2011 Period to Period Percentage Change Year Ended December 31, 2010 Combined Statement of              Operations Data:                      Revenues $         5,594 7.1% $         5,222             Cost of revenues 4,561 8.1% 4,218             Gross profit 1,033 2.8% 1,004             Operating expenses 3,516 (8.6%) 3,767                (2,483) * (2,763)             Other income (expense) 843 * (206)             Loss before income tax expense (1,640) * (2,969)             Federal and state income tax expense - * -             Net loss $       (1,640) * $       (2,969) Percentage of Revenues:                      Revenues 100.0%    100.0%             Cost of revenues 81.5    80.8             Gross profit 18.5    19.2             Operating expenses 62.8    72.1                (44.3)    (52.9)             Other income (expense) 15.1    (4.0)             Loss before income tax expense (29.2)    (56.9)             Federal and state income tax expense -    -             Net loss (29.2%)    (56.9%) *      Period to period percentage change comparisons have only been calculated for positive numbers.     Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2011 with Year Ended December 31, 2010   Our overall revenue increased $372,000, or 7%, to $5,594,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $5,222,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The net increase in revenue was due primarily to the following: a)  Sales of alkaline admixture decreased $40,000 from the same period ended in 2010 – this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in demand with our Ohio-area customers, approximately $19,000 directly from the Toledo operation; b)  Revenue from the service fees for the management of alkaline admixture increased $93,000 from the same period ended in 2010 – this increase was attributed primarily to our Florida-area customers, which increased $89,000 compared to the same period in 2010; and c)  Our processing revenue, including facility management revenue, showed a net increase of $314,000 over the same period ended in 2010.  This was primarily from our Florida operation, which showed an increase of $491,000 in facility management fees over 2010, of which $221,000 was from our agreement with Orange County Utilities that began in December 2010 and ended in March 2011.  Orange County has not nor do we expect them to renew that agreement in the near future.  The start up in April 2011 of the Pennsylvania fuel pilot plant contributed approximately $18,000 to the increase in facility management fee revenue.  Offsetting the increase was a decrease in both facility management and product revenue from the Toledo operation, a decrease of $192,000 from 2010, as contracted operations ceased in November 2011; and d)  Our license fee revenue showed no net change over the same period ended in 2010 – both years revenue was $-0-. Our gross profit increased $28,000, or 3%, to $1,033,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,004,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, and the gross profit margin decreased to 18.5% from 19.2% for the same periods.  The minor overall movements from the prior year in gross profit and gross profit margin are due primarily to three sources of operations in 2011:    1. An increase in total revenue and gross margin from our Florida operation.  The total revenue attributable to Florida in 2011 was $4,442,000, an increase of $583,000 from 2010.  This revenue was generated at a gross margin of 20%, up from 17% in 2010.  Florida contributed $869,000 of gross profit, an increase of $223,000 over the same period in 2010.  A majority of this increase in Florida’s gross profit was from the increased revenue from sludge management fees, which were realized at a lower cost percentage as a result of economies of scale and increased efficiency in sludge handled at the facility.    2. An increase in total revenue of $18,000 from our Pennsylvania fuel pilot start up in April 2011, but which sustained a gross loss of $231,000 for the year.    3. A decrease in total revenue and a small increase in gross profit from our Toledo operation.  The total revenue attributable to Toledo in 2011 was $949,000, a decrease of $201,000 from 2010.  This revenue was generated at a gross margin of approximately 36%.  The Toledo operation contributed $339,000 of gross profit, which was an increase of $40,000 of gross profit over the same period in 2010.  The Toledo operation was more efficient in 2011 due primarily to re-priced alkaline admixture supply contracts at the end of 2010 and a decrease in labor costs. Our operating expenses decreased $252,000, or 7%, to $3,516,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $3,767,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease was primarily due to decreases of $799,000 in consulting fees and expenses, $56,000 in office and miscellaneous expenses, $35,000 in legal and related fees and $15,000 of gain on the disposal of assets, offset by an increase of $386,000 in payroll and related costs and $267,000 in director costs.  Of the total net decrease of $146,000 in consulting, director and payroll costs, $71,000 were non-cash costs relating to the issuances of stock and stock options.  Therefore, for the year ended December 31, 2011 actual cash outlays in these categories decreased by a total of $75,000 over the same period in 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, we recorded an operating loss of $2,483,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to an operating loss of $2,763,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease in the loss of $280,000. Our net nonoperating income (expense) increased by $1,049,000 to net nonoperating income of $843,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from net nonoperating expense of $206,000 for the similar period in 2010.  The increase in net nonoperating income was primarily due to an increase of $873,000 from the gain recorded on warrants issued whose value and number of shares outstanding had decreased from the issuance date, an increase of $93,000 in the gain on extinguishment of certain liabilities no longer due, a decrease of $48,000 in amortization of the stock discount on convertible debentures issued and a decrease of $33,000 from 2010 to 2011 in the gain on the modification of certain debt.  Included in the increase in the gain on extinguishment of certain liabilities no longer due is $174,000 of gain recognized for the reversal of a recorded sales tax liability management determined in the fourth quarter 2011 is no longer due. We recorded a net loss of $1,640,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a net loss of $2,969,000 for the same period ended in 2010, a decrease in the loss of $1,401,000.  Adding back non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, stock and stock options charges and subtracting cash out for capitalized assets and debt repayments, resulted in an adjusted cash loss (non-GAAP) of $329,000 for the year ended in 2011.  Similar non-cash expenses, cash out and debt repayments for the same period in 2010 resulted in an adjusted cash loss (non-GAAP) of $445,000, a decrease in the adjusted cash loss (non-GAAP) of $116,000 for the year ended in 2011 versus 2010, as follows:         2011    2010    GAAP net loss  $(1,640,000)     $(2,969,000)    Depreciation + Amortization 540,000    449,000    Net cash out for fixed assets capitalized or sold (71,000)    (15,000)    Stock, stock options and warrants expense 2,216,000    2,286,000    Amortization of discount on debentures 28,000    108,000    Loss (gain) on market price change of stock warrants issued (732,000)    140,000    Loss (gain) on bad debts recovered or liabilities written off (174,000)    20,000    Debt service payments (496,000)    (464,000)                   "Adjusted cash loss (non-GAAP)"  $(329,000)     $(445,000) For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have not recognized the future tax benefit of current or prior period losses due to our history of operating losses.  Accordingly, our effective tax rate for each period was zero. Liquidity and Capital Resources We had a working capital deficit of $409,000 at December 31, 2011, compared to a working capital deficit of $932,000 at December 31, 2010, resulting in an increase in working capital of $524,000.  Current assets at December 31, 2011 included cash and cash equivalents of $253,000 (including restricted cash of $209,000), which is an increase of $8,000 from December 31, 2010.  The net positive change in working capital from December 31, 2010 was primarily from a reclassification of $578,000 of debentures to long-term debt as a result of the replacement debentures issued in August 2011, a reduction of $186,000 in accrued liabilities and a reduction of $125,000 in the short-term debt due banks and financing entities, offset by a $200,000 increase in notes payable to a related party, a net decrease of $90,000 in trade receivables decreasing more than trade payables, and, a decrease to the net deferred current asset of $75,000 for amortization of common stock and warrants given pursuant to consulting contracts entered into in 2010. In 2011 our cash flow provided by operating activities was $333,000, an increase of $329,000 over 2010.  The components of the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities from 2010 was principally due to a decrease in the net loss of $1,329,000 and a decrease of $556,000 in trade accounts receivable, offset by a decrease of $873,000 in the market price of derivatives issued, a decrease of $575,000 in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $71,000 decrease in stock warrants and stock options issued for fees and services, a net decrease of $1,000 in fixed asset and investment gains and losses, and, a decrease in prepaid and other assets of $36,000. We have modified our business model and have been evolving away from sales of alkaline admixture and royalty-based revenue agreements that typically generate a higher gross profit margin, to long-term and sustainable revenue based on integrated N-Viro technology and operations, but typically generating a lower gross profit margin.  From 2006 to 2011, the percentage of combined revenues generated from our owned and operated facilities in Toledo and Volusia County was:  2006 – 46%;  2007 – 77%;  2008 – 94%;  2009 – 95%;  2010 – 96%;  2011 – 96%.  We believe this shift will allow us to enhance future revenue and profits through growth, efficiency and revenue optimization. The normal collection period for accounts receivable is approximately 30-45 days for the majority of customers.  This is a result of the nature of the license contracts, type of customer and the amount of time required to obtain the information to prepare the billing.  For 2009 and throughout 2010, our customers slowed the overall payment rate on our outstanding receivables, which in turn contributed to us extending payment times to our vendors on our payables.  We make no assurances that payments from our customers or payments to our vendors will become shorter and this may have an adverse impact on our continuing operations. During 2011 we renewed our line of credit with Monroe Bank + Trust, or the Bank, up to $400,000 bearing interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) plus 0.75%, but in no event less than 5.00%, and secured by a first lien on all our assets (except equipment), with a new maturity date of August 15, 2012.  Two certificates of deposit totaling $141,430 from the Bank are held as a condition of maintaining the line of credit.  At December 31, 2011, we had $100,000 of borrowing capacity under the credit facility. On August 1, 2011, we borrowed $200,000 with a Promissory Note payable to a related party of Timothy Kasmoch, our President and Chief Executive Officer, at 12% interest prepaid for a period of three months, renewable for an additional three months by the prepayment of additional interest and secured by certain equipment.  Mr. Kasmoch has personally guaranteed the repayment of this Note.  We extended the Note on October 30, 2011 and again on January 30, 2012, and it is now due April 30, 2012.  We expect to extend the Note on or before the due date but pay the Note in full during 2012. From the beginning of 2006 through 2011, we have borrowed a total of $1,677,100 from ten lenders to purchase processing and automotive equipment.  As of December 31, 2011, a total of thirteen term notes are outstanding, ranging from 6.2% to 10.9% interest for terms ranging three to five years, monthly payments totaling approximately $26,000 and all secured by equipment.  The total amount owed on all equipment-secured notes as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $442,000 and all notes are expected to be paid in full on the applicable maturity date, the last of which is in March 2016. In 2009 we approved an offering of up to $1,000,000 of Convertible Debentures (the “Debentures”), convertible at any time into our unregistered common stock at $2.00 per share.  The Debentures are issuable in $5,000 denominations, are unsecured and have a stated interest rate of 8%, payable quarterly to holders of record.  We have timely paid all accrued interest due to all Debenture holders of record as of each quarter-end date starting in July 2009.  At any time, we may redeem all or a part of the Debentures at face value plus unpaid interest. During 2009 we issued $765,000 of Debentures to a total of twenty three accredited investors, and one investor converted $10,000 of Debentures into unregistered common stock.  During 2010 we issued $55,000 of Debentures, and three investors converted a total of $90,000 of Debentures into unregistered common stock.  The Debentures matured at June 30, 2011, however fifteen investors holding Debentures totaling $365,000 elected to replace them with new ones that now mature at June 30, 2013.  All other features of the “expired” Debentures remained the same in the replacement ones, except for the new maturity date.  Of the four investors totaling $355,000 who did not replace their existing Debentures with new ones, two investors totaling $215,000 had their Debentures repaid; one investor converted $50,000 into unregistered common stock (at June 30, 2011) and one holding $90,000 of Debentures has not made a final decision.  As of December 31, 2011, we held $455,000 of Debentures. Because the fair market value of our common stock (the underlying security in the Debentures) may have been above the conversion price of $2.00 per share at the date of issuance, we were required under GAAP to record a discount given for certain (now) “expired” Debentures sold, which totaled $184,975.  The discount was then required to be amortized as a period expense over the periods the Debentures were scheduled to be outstanding, which averaged 20 months, through the maturity date of June 30, 2011.  For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, amortization expense on the “expired” Debentures amounted to $52,326 and $108,334, respectively. For periods subsequent to June 30, 2011, we are required under GAAP to record a discount totaling $32,737 for certain Debentures replaced, and a gain on debt modification during the quarter ended June 30, 2011.  The discount is required to be amortized as a period expense over the next eight quarters the Debentures are scheduled to be outstanding.  For the six months ended December 31, 2011 these “replacement” debentures have been outstanding, amortization expense amounted to $8,184. For 2012, we expect to improve operating results and have adequate cash or access to cash to adequately fund operations and debt service by focusing on existing and expected new sources of revenue, especially from our N-Viro Fuel technology, and cash generated from equity issuances and exercises of outstanding warrants and options.  We expect that market developments favoring cleaner burning renewable energy sources and ongoing discussions with companies in the fuel and wastewater industries could provide enhanced liquidity and have a positive impact on future operations.  We continue to pursue opportunities with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of the patented N-Viro Fuel technology.  In addition, we are focusing on the development of regional biosolids processing facilities, and are currently in negotiations with potential partners to permit and develop independent, regional facilities. There can be no assurance these discussions will be successful or result in new revenue or cash funding sources for the company.  Our failure to achieve improvements in operating results, including through these potential sources of revenue, or in our ability to adequately finance or secure additional sources of funds would likely have a material adverse effect on our continuing operations. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, we did not have any material commercial commitments, including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. From time to time, during the normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions.  These include: (i) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on our negligence or willful misconduct and (ii) indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts.  Pursuant to Delaware law, we may indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at our request in such capacity.  We also have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts that we may pay for indemnification purposes.  We believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability for which we may provide indemnification.  The majority of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make.  We have not recorded any liability for these indemnities, commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Critical accounting policies, estimates and assumptions In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The following are the significant estimates and assumptions made in preparation of the financial statements: Non-domestic license and territory fees – We do not recognize revenue on any non-domestic license or territory fee contracts until the cash is received, assuming all other tests of revenue recognition are met.  Canada is excluded from this definition of non-domestic. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts – We estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and the evaluation and the likelihood of success in collecting the receivable.  The balance of the allowance at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is $70,000. Property and Equipment/Long-Lived Assets – Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment.  The carrying amount of an asset (group) is considered impaired if it exceeds the sum of our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (group), excluding interest charges.  Property, machinery and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  We believe the carrying amount is not impaired based upon estimated future cash flows. Intangible Assets – Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value with its carrying value.  Significant estimates used in the determination of fair value include estimates of future cash flows.  As required under current accounting standards, we test for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Income Taxes – We assume the deductibility of certain costs in income tax filings and estimate the recovery of deferred income tax assets, all of which is fully reserved. New Accounting Standards – The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has issued the following new accounting and interpretations, which may be applicable in the future to us: There are no Accounting Standards Updates expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.   Item 7A.                  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide this information under Item 305 of Regulation S-K.            		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 52 Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Item 1A – “Risk Factors.” Overview Our subsidiaries provide long-term, subacute and related specialty healthcare services primarily to the senior population in the United States. We were engaged in the following three principal business segments during 2011:    Ø inpatient services, consisted of 165 skilled nursing centers, 14 combined skilled nursing, assisted and independent living centers, ten assisted living centers, two independent living centers and eight mental health centers and hospice services in 11 states;    Ø rehabilitation therapy services; and    Ø medical staffing services. We continually review our operations and portfolio of facilities to determine if any of these operations or assets no longer fit with our business strategies.  This review has resulted in dispositions of certain assets and operations. During 2011, we disposed of a Maryland skilled nursing center in our Inpatient Services segment, whose results have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with GAAP.  The disposition, which was effective on August 1, 2011, resulted in cash proceeds to us of $1.8 million, net of our repayment of the related $5.2 million mortgage note.  During August 2011, we also divested two hospice operations in Oklahoma for a nominal price plus the assumption of certain liabilities by the buyer. The disposition resulted in a loss of $0.7 million, net of related tax benefit. 2011 Restructuring    On July 29, 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) released its final rule for skilled nursing facilities for the 2012 federal fiscal year, which commenced on October 1, 2011 (the “CMS Final Rule”). As a result of the expected negative impact of the CMS Final Rule on our business, we implemented a broad-based mitigation initiative, which included infrastructure cost reductions without affecting the quality of our patient care. These reductions in infrastructure costs were, and continue to be, necessary to mitigate the impact on our business and remain in compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. During our third quarter ended September 30, 2011, in connection with our mitigation initiative, we incurred $2.4 million of restructuring costs, which consisted primarily of severance benefits resulting from reductions of staff. For additional information regarding the impact to us of the CMS Final Rule, please see Item 7 – “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Medicare” below. 2010 Restructuring As discussed in Item 1 – “Business,” in 2010 Old Sun completed a restructuring of its business by separating its real estate assets and its operating assets into two separate publicly traded companies, Sabra and New Sun.  New Sun changed its name to Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. following the merger of Old Sun into Sabra.  Pursuant to master lease agreements that were entered into between subsidiaries of Sabra and of New Sun in connection with the Separation, subsidiaries of Sabra lease to subsidiaries of New Sun the properties that    24    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES     Sabra’s subsidiaries own following the REIT Conversion Merger.   The Separation was accounted for as a reverse spinoff where New Sun was designated as the “accounting” spinnor and Sabra was designated as the “accounting” spinnee.  Accordingly, the assets and liabilities distributed were recorded based on their historical carrying values. The historical carrying values of assets and liabilities distributed to Sabra in the Separation are as follows (in thousands): Cash   $ $66,862   Restricted cash     5,527   Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and         amortization of $91,878     484,801   Intangible and other assets, net     16,116   Long-term debt and mortgage notes payable     (386,678  ) Accrued interest on mortgage notes payable     (1,425  ) Other accrued liabilities     (2,326  ) Deferred tax liabilities     (20,670  ) Due to Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.     (5,307  ) Net distribution   $ $156,900   For accounting purposes, the historical consolidated financial statements of Old Sun became the historical consolidated financial statements of New Sun after the distribution on November 15, 2010.   Revenues from Medicare, Medicaid and Other Sources We receive revenues from Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, self-pay residents, other third-party payors and healthcare centers that utilize our specialty medical services. The sources and amounts of our inpatient services revenues are determined by a number of factors, including the number of licensed beds and occupancy rates of our centers, the acuity level of patients and the rates of reimbursement among payors. Federal and state governments continue to focus on methods to curb spending on health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and pressures on state budgets resulting from the recent adverse economic conditions in the United States may intensify these efforts. This focus has not been limited to skilled nursing centers, but includes specialty services provided by us, such as skilled therapy services, to third parties. We cannot at this time predict the extent to which proposals limiting federal or state expenditures will be adopted or, if adopted and implemented, what effect, if any, such proposals will have on us. Efforts to impose reduced coverage, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. In addition, due to recent adverse economic conditions, we have experienced reduced demand for the specialty services that we provide to third parties.  If economic conditions do not improve or worsen, we may experience additional reductions in demand for the specialty services we provide.  We are unable at this time to predict the impact or extent of such reduced demand.    25    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table sets forth the total nonaffiliated revenues and percentage of revenues by payor source for our continuing operations, on a consolidated and on an inpatient operations only basis, for the periods indicated (data includes revenues for acquired centers following the date of acquisition only):      For the Years Ended   Sources of Revenues   December 31, 2011     December 31, 2010     December 31, 2009        (dollars in thousands)   Consolidated:                                       Medicaid   $ 759,471       39.3  %   $ 763,458       40.2  %   $ 745,967       39.9  %   Medicare     612,185       31.7       564,766       29.8       551,482       29.5     Private pay and other     461,168       23.9       472,284       24.9       469,986       25.2     Managed care and                                                    commercial insurance     97,516       5.1       95,997       5.1       101,489       5.4   Total   $ 1,930,340       100.0  %   $ 1,896,505       100.0  %   $ 1,868,924       100.0  %                                                    Inpatient Only:                                                   Medicaid   $ 759,357       44.1  %   $ 763,307       45.2  %   $ 745,834       44.9  %   Medicare     593,309       34.4       546,107       32.4       535,229       32.2     Private pay and other     274,822       15.9       282,850       16.8       281,066       16.8     Managed care and                                                    commercial insurance     96,337       5.6       94,823       5.6       100,770       6.1   Total   $ 1,723,825       100.0  %   $ 1,687,087       100.0  %   $ 1,662,899       100.0  % Medicare Medicare is available to nearly every United States citizen 65 years of age and older. It is a broad program of health insurance designed to help the nation’s elderly meet hospital, hospice, home health and other health care costs. Health insurance coverage extends to certain persons under age 65 who qualify as disabled or those having end-stage renal disease. Medicare is comprised of four related health insurance programs.  Medicare Part A provides for inpatient services including hospital, skilled long-term care, hospice and home healthcare. Medicare Part B provides for outpatient services including physicians’ services, diagnostic service, durable medical equipment, skilled therapy services and medical supplies.  Medicare Part C is a managed care option (“Medicare Advantage”) for beneficiaries who are entitled to Part A and enrolled in Part B.  Medicare Part D is a benefit that provides prescription drug benefits for both Medicare and Medicare/Medicaid dually eligible patients. Medicare reimburses our skilled nursing centers for Medicare Part A services under the Prospective Payment System (“PPS”) as defined by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and subsequent legislative and rule changes. PPS regulations predetermine a payment amount per patient, per day, based on the 1995 costs of treating patients indexed forward.  Prior to October 1, 2010, the amount to be paid was determined by classifying each patient into one of 53 Resource Utilization Groups (“RUGs”), which were collectively referred to as “RUGs III”.  After October 1, 2010, the RUGs were expanded to 66 categories to provide further refinement and are referred to collectively as “RUGs IV”.  Each RUGs level represents the level of services required to treat the patient’s condition or level of acuity. The RUGs III system reimbursed for therapy service delivered concurrently, in a group or individually, at the same rate.  The RUGs IV system changes maintain the same reimbursement methodology for group and individual therapy, but will only consider concurrent therapy if it is delivered to two patients and divides the services between the two patients that receive the services.  Changes were also made to the required    26    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   qualifications for each RUGs level.   The following table sets forth the average amounts of inpatient Medicare Part A revenues per patient, per day, recorded by our healthcare centers for the years ended December 31:    2011    2010    2009 $ 506.53 $ 476.57 $ 454.99 Under current law, there are limits on reimbursement provided under Medicare Part B for therapy services.  An automatic exception was in place for patients residing in skilled nursing centers.  That exception will continue through December 31, 2012. Effective January 1, 2011, changes were made in the payment methodology for Medicare Part B services received by patients in a skilled nursing facility setting. As part of the Physician Fee Schedule, CMS applied a Multiple Procedure Payment Reduction (“MPPR”).  CMS previously applied an MPPR to diagnostic services and has now expanded it to include other Part B services.  A portion of the payment for Part B services is related to activities that CMS contends are only delivered one time when multiple units of the same or related services are delivered on the same day.  CMS reduced the portion of the rate that contains these services by 25%, which equates to a 7.2% reduction in the reimbursement rate for Part B therapy services provided by us.  The change reduces the amount we are able to charge to internal and external customers.  We estimate the impact to be a $6.5 million annual reduction in consolidated revenues.   On July 29, 2011, CMS released the CMS Final Rule, which became effective on October 1, 2011.  Pursuant to the CMS Final Rule, Medicare part A payment rates were reduced by 12.6% (i.e., the Medicare rate parity adjustment) to correct what CMS perceived as a lack of parity between RUGs III and RUGs IV. The CMS Final Rule also changed the reimbursement rules associated with group therapy and introduced new change-of-therapy provisions as patients move through their post-acute stay.  The CMS Final Rule therapy reimbursement changes resulted in further reductions in our revenues from the Medicare program (prior to implementation of our therapy mitigation plans) and also served to increase our costs of providing such therapy services.  On October 1, 2011, we also received a net 1.7% market basket increase to our prospective Medicare rates.  We originally estimated that the combined negative impact on our operations of the Medicare rate parity adjustment and the changes in therapy provisions of the CMS Final Rule (after putting into place internal management plans to mitigate a portion of the negative impact without affecting the quality of our patient care) was a reduction of income before income taxes of between $22.0 million to $23.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011.  As a result of our better than expected execution in the fourth quarter of 2011 of our management mitigation plans, particularly in the area of therapy mitigation, we were able to reduce our original projected impact of the CMS Final Rule by approximately $5.0 million in the quarter.  Prospectively, we expect the impact of the CMS Final Rule on our full year 2012 operations to be a year-over-year reduction in income before income taxes of approximately $40.0 million to $45.0 million due to the ramp-up nature of many elements of our management mitigation plans. On February 17, 2012, Congress passed the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2011 which included a provision associated with the reduction in the reimbursement rules associated with Medicare bad debts.  Medicare bad debts are primarily generated when states do not reimburse the provider for co-insurance on Medicare/Medicaid dually eligible patients.  Providers are not permitted to bill this co-insurance to any other party when Medicaid does not reimburse the provider cost of service.  Prior to this legislation, Medicare    27    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES     reimbursed providers 100% for this uncollectable co-insurance associated with dually eligible patients.  Under the newly enacted legislation, Medicare will now phase in a reduction in the percentage of reimbursement for uncollectable co-insurance starting in federal fiscal year 2013, which commences on October 1, 2012.  It is not clear if states will reimburse for dually eligible patient co-insurance under the state Medicaid programs as a result of this new legislation.  If states do not begin to reimburse for dually eligible patient co-insurance then we are projecting the result will be a reduction in our revenues from reimbursement of Medicare bad debts of approximately $0.6 million in 2012, $2.8 million in 2013, $5.0 million in 2014 and $6.7 million in subsequent years. On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which created The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.  This Committee was tasked to find $1.5 trillion in savings by November 23, 2011.  The Committee was unable to reach an agreement and as a result, sequestration as provided for in the Budget Control Act was trigged.  Sequestration will result in a 2% reduction in payments for skilled nursing centers effective January 1, 2013, which we estimate will reduce our revenues by approximately $2.2 million annually. We receive Medicare reimbursements for hospice care at daily or hourly rates based on the level of care furnished to the patient.  Our ability to receive Medicare reimbursement for our hospice services is subject to two limitations:    · If inpatient days of care provided to all patients at a hospice exceed 20% of the total days of hospice care provided by that hospice for an annual period, then payment for days in excess of this limit are paid for at the lower routine home care rate.  None of our hospice programs exceeded the payment limits on inpatient services for 2011 or 2010.    · Overall payments made by Medicare on a per hospice program basis are subject to a cap amount at the end of an annual period.  The cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of first time Medicare hospice beneficiaries during the year by the Medicare per beneficiary cap amount, resulting in that hospice’s aggregate cap, which is the allowable amount of total Medicare payments that hospice can receive for that cap year.  If a hospice program exceeds its aggregate cap, then the hospice must repay the excess. In July 2011, CMS issued its final rule for hospice services for the 2012 federal fiscal year.  The rule includes a market basket increase of 3.0% and a 0.6% decrease resulting from a phase out of the wage index budget neutrality factor.  We estimate that the net impact on our hospice service operations of these two adjustments and updated wage index data will be an increase of 2.2% in our reimbursement rates, which we estimate will result in increased revenues of approximately $0.3 million per quarter. Medicaid Medicaid is a state-administered program financed by state funds and federal matching funds. The program provides for medical assistance to the indigent and certain other eligible persons. Although administered under broad federal regulations, states are given flexibility to construct programs and payment methods. Each state in which we operate nursing and rehabilitation centers has its own unique Medicaid reimbursement system. Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, and there have been cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for nursing homes.  The recent economic downturn has caused many states to institute freezes on or reductions in Medicaid spending to address state budget concerns. Twenty-one of the states in which our Inpatient Services segment operates impose a provider tax on nursing    28    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   homes as a method of increasing federal matching funds paid to those states for Medicaid.  Those states that have imposed the provider tax have used some or all of the matching funds to fund Medicaid reimbursement to nursing homes. The following table sets forth the average amounts of inpatient Medicaid revenues per patient, per day ( excluding any impact of individually identifiable state-imposed provider taxes), recorded by our healthcare centers for the years ended December 31:    2011    2010    2009 $ 174.46 $ 173.21 $ 171.20 For comparison purposes, the following table sets forth the average amounts of inpatient Medicaid revenues per patient, per day, ( including the impact from individually identifiable state-imposed provider taxes), recorded by our healthcare centers for the years ended December 31:    2011    2010    2009 $ 159.21 $ 159.36 $ 159.13 Managed Care and Insurance During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received 5.1% of our revenues from managed care and insurance, of which the Medicare Advantage program is the primary component.  As discussed above, Medicare Advantage is the managed care option for Medicare beneficiaries.  Medicare Advantage is administered by contracted third-party payors.  The managed care and insurance payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs through direct contracts with healthcare providers and increased utilization review.  These payors are increasingly demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. The following table sets forth the average amounts of inpatient revenues per patient, per day, recorded by our healthcare centers from these revenue sources for the years ended December 31:    2011    2010    2009 $ 375.62 $ 373.92 $ 373.21 Private Payors, Veterans and Other During the year ended December 31, 2011, we received 23.9% of our revenues from private payors, veterans’ coverage, healthcare centers that utilize our specialty medical services, self-pay center residents and other third-party payors. These private and other payors are continuing their efforts to control healthcare costs.  Private payor rates are set at a price point that enables continued competition; they are driven by the markets in which our healthcare centers operate. The following table sets forth the average amounts of inpatient revenues per patient, per day, recorded by our healthcare centers from these revenue sources for the years ended December 31:    2011    2010    2009 $ 190.39 $ 188.00 $ 178.95    29    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Other Reimbursement Matters Net revenues realizable under third-party payor agreements are subject to change due to examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the settlement process. Under cost-based reimbursement plans, payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable or because additional supporting documentation is necessary. We recognize revenues from third-party payors and accrue estimated settlement amounts in the period in which the related services are provided. We estimate these settlement balances by making determinations based on our prior settlement experience and our understanding of the applicable reimbursement rules and regulations.    30    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES The following discussion of the “Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010” and “Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009” is based on the financial information presented in Note 13 – “Segment Information” of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Total net revenues increased $33.8 million, or 1.8%, to $1,930.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,896.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Of this increase in revenues, $36.7 million was contributed by our Inpatient Services segment and $0.2 million by our Rehabilitation Therapy segment. The increases were offset by a $3.1 million decrease in revenue from our Medical Staffing segment. Operating salaries and benefits expense increased $14.3 million, or 1.3%, to $1,086.1 million (56.3% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,071.8 million (56.5% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increases in employee wage rates were partially offset by decreased salaries and benefits in our housekeeping and laundry departments following the outsourcing of the majority of the housekeeping and laundry services. Self-insurance for workers’ compensation and general and professional liability insurance decreased $9.4 million, or 13.4%, to $61.0 million (3.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $70.4 million (3.7% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease was attributable to decreased workers’ compensation liability insurance costs driven by favorable claims experience. General and administrative expenses increased $1.5 million, or 2.5%, to $62.3 million (3.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $60.8 million (3.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.   The increase was due to increased salaries and bonus costs. Other operating costs increased $13.3 million, or 3.0%, to $452.2 million (23.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $438.9 million (23.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase in other operating costs was principally comprised of cost increases due to increased provider taxes, coupled with increases in contract labor for housekeeping and laundry services. Center rent expense increased $63.9 million, or 75.7%, to $148.3 million (7.7% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $84.4 million (4.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.   The increase was primarily due to increased rent paid to Sabra after the Separation. Depreciation and amortization decreased $15.5 million, or 32.6%, to $32.1 million (1.7% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $47.6 million (2.5% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation related to buildings as a result of the transfer of substantially all of our real estate to Sabra in the Separation. The provision for losses on accounts receivable increased $4.9 million, or 24.0%, to $25.3 million (1.3% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $20.4 million (1.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase relates to recording $5.0 million of additional provision in 2011 associated with the collectability of existing private-pay receivables. Net interest expense decreased $23.2 million, or 54.3%, to $19.5 million (1.0% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $42.7 million (2.3% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010, principally due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness coupled with reduced debt balances following the Separation.    32    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   Income tax expense increased $9.5 million, or 320.2%, to $12.5 million (0.6% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $3.0 million (0.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010, principally due to increased income before income taxes after adjusting for certain 2011 costs that will not be deductible for income tax purposes (primarily the loss on asset impairment). Other expenses are comprised of loss on asset impairment, transaction costs, loss on sale of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt and restructuring costs.  Other expenses increased $261.4 million to $320.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is driven by $317.1 million loss on asset impairment (see “Critical Accounting Estimates – Impairment of Assets”). Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $25.5 million, or 21.2%, to $95.1 million (4.9% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $120.6 million (6.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease was primarily attributable to the additional center rent expense paid to Sabra after the Separation, but partially offset by reduced interest expense associated with reduced debt balances following the Separation.  For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA, including a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see footnote 6 to Item 6 – “Selected Financial Data” of this Annual Report. Segment information Our reportable segments are strategic business units that provide different products and services. They are managed separately because each business has different marketing strategies due to differences in types of customers, distribution channels and capital resource needs. The following table sets forth the amount and percentage of certain elements of total net revenues for the years ended December 31 (dollars in thousands):      2011     2010     2009   Inpatient Services   $ 1,723,825       89.3  %   $ 1,687,088       89.0  %   $ 1,662,899       89.0  % Rehabilitation Therapy Services     252,009       13.1       206,088       10.9       179,533       9.6   Medical Staffing Services     89,381       4.6       91,801       4.8       102,554       5.5   Corporate     39       0.0       40       0.0       34       0.0   Intersegment eliminations     (134,914  )     (7.0  )     (88,512  )     (4.7  )     (76,096  )     (4.1  ) Total net revenues   $ 1,930,340       100  %   $ 1,896,505       100.0  %   $ 1,868,924       100.0  % Inpatient services revenues for long-term care, subacute care and assisted living services include revenues billed to patients or third-party payors for therapy and medical staffing services provided by our affiliated operations.  The following table sets forth a summary of the intersegment revenues for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):      2011     2010     2009   Rehabilitation Therapy Services   $ 132,143     $ 86,476     $ 74,166   Medical Staffing Services     2,771       2,036       1,930   Total affiliated revenues   $ 134,914     $ 88,512     $ 76,096   We evaluate the operational strengths and performance of each segment based on financial measures, including net segment income.  Net segment income is defined as earnings before loss (gain) on sale of assets,    33    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   net, restructuring costs, transaction costs, income tax benefit and discontinued operations. Net segment income for the year ended December 31, 2011 for (1) our Inpatient Services segment decreased $39.9 million, or 26.5%, to $110.8 million, (2) our Rehabilitation Therapy services segment decreased $0.8 million, or 6.1%, to $13.2 million and (3) our Medical Staffing services segment decreased $0.3 million, or 6.5%, to $5.2 million due to the factors discussed below for each segment. We use the measure of net segment income to help identify opportunities for improvement and assist in allocating resources to each segment.   The following table sets forth the amount of net segment income for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):      2011     2010     2009   Inpatient Services   $ 110,786     $ 150,683     $ 156,595   Rehabilitation Therapy Services     13,217       14,073       11,112   Medical Staffing Services     5,232       5,595       8,610   Net segment income before Corporate     129,235       170,351       176,317   Corporate     (85,711  )     (110,986 )   $ (102,368 ) Net segment income   $ 43,524     $ 59,365       73,949   Inpatient Services.   Net revenues increased $36.7 million, or 2.2%, to $1,723.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $1,687.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase in net revenues was primarily the result of: - an increase of $37.9 million in Medicare revenues, driven by $43.7 million of increased revenue from increased Medicare Part A rates (prior to the impact of the fourth quarter 12.6% Medicare rate parity adjustment), $7.2 million of increased revenue from increased Medicare Part A customer base and $2.0 million of increased revenues from increased Medicare Part B volumes all of which was then partially offset by approximately $15.0 million of decreased Medicare revenues from the implementation of the CMS Final Rule 12.6% Medicare rate parity adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2011;       - an increase of $13.0 million in hospice revenues due to internal customer base growth and acquisition revenue growth;       - an increase of $1.8 million in commercial insurance and managed care revenues due primarily to a higher customer base;       - an increase of $1.6 million in other revenues including veterans and other various inpatient services; and       - an increase of $0.2 million in Medicaid revenues;          offset by       - a $9.5 million decrease due to closure of operations in 2010 and 2011; and       - a $8.3 million decrease in private revenues consisting of a $10.2 million decrease due to a lower customer base, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in rates. Operating salaries and benefits expenses decreased $28.6 million, or 3.4%, to $803.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $832.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease was primarily due to:   - a decrease of $25.7 million in therapist salaries due to their transfer from our Inpatient Services     34    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES    segment to our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment;     - a decrease of $6.6 million in associated with the outsourcing of substantially all our housekeeping and laundry services; and       - a decrease of $4.0 million in overtime pay;          offset by       - increases in compensation and related benefits and taxes of $7.7 million to remain competitive in local markets. Self-insurance for workers’ compensation and general and professional liability insurance increased $2.8 million, or 5.2%, to $56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase was driven by increased claims related activity in our general and professional liability self-insurance. Other operating costs increased $59.8 million, or 13.2%, to $514.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $454.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase was primarily due to: - a $43.3 million increase in contract labor resulting from use of therapists in our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment who were formerly employed by our Inpatient Services segment plus an increase in higher acuity patients requiring more rehabilitation therapy;       - a $7.3 million increase in purchased services primarily related to the outsourcing of substantially all our housekeeping and laundry services (but inclusive of other services as well);       - a $5.3 million increase in provider taxes due to increased provider tax rates from a number of states in which we operate;       - a $4.1 million increase in other supplies;       - a $2.7 million increase in utility costs;       - a $0.9 million increase in equipment and storage lease; and       - a $0.5 million increase in other expenses, primarily patient transport, penalties and other insurance;          offset by       - a $2.3 million decrease in administrative costs to manage the therapists that transferred to our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment;       - a $1.0 million increase in discounts and rebates from suppliers; and       - a $1.0 million decrease in education and training costs. Operating administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 2.2%, to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to    35    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   lower meetings and conferences expense. The provision for losses on accounts receivable increased $4.9 million, or 25.5%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The increase relates to recording $5.0 million of additional provision in 2011 associated with the collectability of existing private-pay receivables.   Center rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $64.1 million, or 77.2%, to $147.1 million, compared to $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was attributable to the new lease agreements entered into with Sabra in conjunction with the Separation and other negotiated rent increases. Depreciation and amortization decreased $16.2 million, or 37.7%, to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in depreciation related to the transfer of substantially all of our real estate to Sabra in conjunction with the Separation. Net interest expense decreased $9.1 million, or 100.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  The decrease is the result of the transfer of mortgages for previously owned centers to Sabra in conjunction with the Separation. Our remaining owned centers have no debt. Rehabilitation Therapy Services .   Total revenues increased $45.9 million, or 22.3%, to $252.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $206.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.  Of the $45.9 million increase in total revenues, affiliated contract revenues increased $45.7 million and nonaffiliated contract revenues increased $0.2 million. The completion of the transfer of therapy employees from our Inpatient Services segment to our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment (which began in November 2010) combined with service volume growth and improved rates drove the affiliated contract revenue increase. The increase in nonaffiliated contract revenues was due primarily to increased productivity coupled with contract rate increases. Affiliated and non-affiliated volume growth was partially offset by the negative effects of the changes in reimbursement for therapy occasioned by the implementation of RUGs IV in October 2010 and MPPR which began in January 2011. The therapy-delivery process changes made by Rehabilitation Therapy Services in the fourth quarter of 2011 helped reduce the originally expected negative impact of the CMS Final Rule. Operating salaries and benefits expenses increased $43.0 million, or 25.0%, to $215.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to service volume growth, including the transfer of therapy employees from our Inpatient Services segment, and an average increase of 1.7% in therapy wage rates. Other operating costs, including contract labor expenses, increased $1.3 million, or 16.6%, to $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased contract labor, education and training, and administrative expenses resulting from the increased business volume. Medical Staffing Services.   Total revenues from Medical Staffing Services decreased $2.4 million, or 2.6%, to $89.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $91.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of: - a $1.7 million decrease in staffing allied medical professionals due to a decline of 7,414 hours;      36    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES - a decrease in locum tenens (physician placement) business of $1.1 million; and        offset by       - a $0.4 million increase in the nurse staffing business.   Other operating costs decreased $1.5 million, or 11.4%, to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in hours associated with the decline in revenues. Corporate.   General and administrative costs not directly attributed to operating segments increased $1.5 million, or 2.4%, to $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was principally due to a net increase in salaries and bonus costs prior to the 2011 Restructuring. Interest expense Net interest expense not directly attributed to operating segments decreased $14.1 million, or 41.9%, to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease was principally due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness coupled with reduced debt balances. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Total net revenue increased $27.6 million, or 1.5%, to $1,896.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,868.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Of this increase in revenue, $24.2 million was contributed by our Inpatient Services segment and $14.3 million by our Rehabilitation Therapy segment.  These increases were offset by a $10.9 million decrease in revenue from our Medical Staffing segment. Operating salaries and benefits expense increased $22.0 million, or 2.1%, to $1,071.8 million (56.5% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1,049.8 million (56.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase is primarily the result of wage rate increases. Self-insurance for workers’ compensation and general and professional liability insurance increased $7.0 million, or 11.0%, to $70.5 million (3.7% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $63.5 million (3.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was attributable to increased general and professional liability insurance costs driven by adverse developments in claims incurred in prior years. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 2.1%, to $60.8 million (3.2% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $62.1 million (3.3% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.   The decrease was due to decreased salaries and bonus costs driven by continued efforts to control costs. Other operating costs increased $6.7 million, or 1.5%, to $438.9 million (23.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $432.2 million (23.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase in other operating costs was principally comprised of cost increases due to increased provider taxes, coupled with increases in service contracts for software maintenance. Center rent expense increased $12.0 million, or 16.6%, to $84.4 million (4.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $72.4 million (3.9% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.    37    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES The increase was primarily due to increased rent paid to Sabra after the Separation. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.5 million, or 5.5%, to $47.6 million (2.5% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $45.1 million (2.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was primarily attributable to additional capital expenditures incurred for information systems improvements in 2010, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to buildings as a result of the transfer of substantially all of our real estate to Sabra in the Separation. The provision for losses on accounts receivable decreased $0.5 million, or 2.4%, to $20.4 million (1.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $20.9 million (1.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was principally driven by improved cash collections. Net interest expense decreased $6.2 million, or 12.6%, to $42.7 million (2.3% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $49.0 million (2.6% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009, principally due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness coupled with reduced debt balances following the Separation. Income tax expense decreased $26.6 million, or 90.0%, to $3.0 million (0.1% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $29.6 million (1.6% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009, principally due to a decrease in income before income taxes and discontinued operations. Other expenses (income) are comprised of transaction costs, loss (gain) on sale of assets, loss on extinguishment of debt and restructuring costs.  Other expenses increased $57.9 million to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was driven by $29.1 million of transaction costs and $29.2 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, both of which were due to the Separation and REIT Conversion Merger. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased $47.4 million, or 28.2%, to $120.6 million (6.4% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $168.0 million (9.0% of net revenues) for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was primarily attributable to transaction costs incurred for the Separation ($29.1 million), operating salaries and benefits ($22.0 million), self-insurance for workers’ compensation and general and professional liability insurance ($7.0 million), and other operating costs ($6.7 million), offset by additional revenues of $27.6 million, all discussed above.  For an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA, including a description of our uses of, and the limitations associated with, Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see footnote 6 to Item 6 – “Selected Financial Data” of this Annual Report.

AND SUBSIDIARIES    offset by       - a $6.2 million decrease in managed care and commercial insurance revenues due to a lower customer base;       - a $4.8 million decrease in private revenues also due to a lower customer base;       - a $4.5 million decrease due to closure of operations in 2010 and 2009; and       - a $1.7 million decrease in Medicare revenues driven by a $23.6 million decrease due to a lower customer base, which was mitigated by increases in Medicare Part A rates and Medicare Part B revenues, which resulted in increased revenues of $21.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Operating salaries and benefits expenses increased $5.0 million, or 0.6%, to $832.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $827.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was primarily due to: - increases in compensation and related benefits and taxes of $6.0 million to remain competitive in local markets;          offset by       - a decrease of $1.0 million in overtime expenses. Self-insurance for workers’ compensation and general and professional liability insurance decreased $5.5 million, or 9.2%, to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $59.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was attributable to a $4.2 million decrease in general and professional liability insurance costs and a $1.3 million decrease in workers’ compensation costs. Other operating costs increased $20.6 million, or 4.7%, to $454.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $434.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was primarily due to: - a $8.2 million increase contract labor resulting from use of therapists in our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment who were formerly employed by our Inpatient Services segment as well an increase in the number of new Rehab Recovery Suites coming on line;       - a $6.6 million increase in taxes, primarily provider taxes;       - a $4.5 million increase in purchased services of which a majority of the increase was in service contracts, software maintenance and collection agency expense;       - a $1.6 million increase in administrative costs to manage therapists;       - a $1.0 million increase in utility costs;       - a $0.9 million increase in legal fees; and       - a $0.4 million increase in other supplies costs, principally food and medical supplies costs;          offset by      40    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES - a $1.3 million decrease in equipment rental; and       - a $1.3 million decrease in training and recruitment costs.   Operating administrative expenses were consistent with the prior year at $41.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The provision for losses on accounts receivable decreased $1.1 million, or 5.5%, to $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was due to improved cash collections. Center rent expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $12.0 million, or 16.9%, to $83.0 million, compared to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was attributable to the new lease agreements entered into with Sabra in conjunction with the Separation and negotiated rent increases. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.0 million, or 4.8%, to $43.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $41.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Increases in depreciation and amortization related to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements, respectively, were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation related to buildings transferred to Sabra in the Separation. Net interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $9.1 million as compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease of $2.8 million was a result of lower borrowing costs and lower aggregate borrowings, and the transfer of mortgages to Sabra in conjunction with the Separation. Rehabilitation Therapy Services .   Total revenues increased $26.6 million, or 14.8%, to $206.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $179.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Of the $26.6 million increase in total revenues, affiliated contract revenues increased $12.3 million; nonaffiliated contract revenues increased $13.2 million and other revenue increased $1.1 million. The addition of 35 affiliated contracts, combined with a rate increase and service volume growth drove the affiliated contract revenue increase. The increase in nonaffiliated contract revenues was due primarily to new contracts (net positive change in contract count), rate increases in existing business and growth in dysphagia and management services business lines.  Affiliated and non-affiliated volume growth was offset by the negative effects of the changes in reimbursement for therapy occasioned by the implementation of RUGs IV in October 2010. Operating salaries and benefits expenses increased $21.7 million, or 14.4%, to $172.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $150.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to service volume growth and an average increase of 1.66% in therapy wage rates. Other operating costs, including contract labor expenses, increased $0.4 million, or 5.3%, to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased contract labor, supplies, administrative and business tax expenses resulting from the increased business volume. Medical Staffing Services.   Total revenues from Medical Staffing Services decreased $10.8 million, or 10.5%, to $91.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $102.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in revenues was primarily the result of:   - a $8.1 million decrease in staffing other medical professionals due to a decline of 82,600 hours;    41    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES - a decrease in locum tenens (physician placement) business of $3.3 million; and       - a $0.1 million decrease due to nursing offices permanently closed in 2009;          offset by       - a $0.7 million increase in the nurse staffing business. Operating salaries and benefits expenses decreased $4.7 million, or 6.5%, to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The $4.7 million decrease was primarily driven by the decline in business volume. Other operating costs decreased $2.9 million, or 18.5%, to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in hours associated with the decline in revenues. Corporate.   General and administrative costs not directly attributed to operating segments decreased $1.3 million, or 2.1%, to $60.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $62.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was due to decreased salaries and bonus costs driven by continued efforts to control costs. Interest expense Net interest expense not directly attributed to operating segments decreased $3.5 million, or 9.4%, to $33.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 from $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease was principally due to lower interest rates on variable rate indebtedness coupled with reduced debt balances. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the year ended and as of December 31, 2011, our net loss was $291.8 million, which included a $317.1 million non-cash loss on asset impairment, and our working capital was $149.1 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.9 million, $60.0 million available on our revolving credit facility and $89.8 million in borrowings. In December 2011, we voluntarily paid down $50 million of term loans in conjunction with amending the the terms of our credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility.  The amendment increased our interest rate by 1.25% in return for greater flexibility to our financial covenants.  As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Based on current levels of operations, we believe that our operating cash flows (which were $83.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011), existing cash reserves and availability for borrowing under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient funds for our operations, capital expenditures (both discretionary and nondiscretionary) as discussed under “Capital Expenditures”, scheduled debt service payments and our other commitments described in the table under “Obligations and Commitments” at least through the next twelve months. We believe our long-term liquidity needs will be satisfied by these same sources, as well as borrowings as required to refinance indebtedness. Although our credit agreement, which is described under “Loan Agreements”, contains restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we currently believe that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness, if needed. However, there can be no    42    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.        Since April 2007, we have relied on our cash flows to provide for operational needs and capital expenditures, and have not relied on revolving credit borrowings. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will continue to provide sufficient cash flow or that refinancing sources will be available in the future, particularly given current economic conditions. We anticipate that we will be able to utilize our revolving credit facility if needed, as we expect to remain in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit agreement for at least the next twelve months. In December 2011, we voluntarily paid down $50 million of term loans in conjunction with amending the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased our interest rate by 1.25% in return for greater flexibility to our financial covenants. As a result of the expected negative impact of the CMS Final Rule on our business, we implemented a broad-based mitigation initiative, which includes infrastructure cost reductions without affecting the quality of our patient care. These reductions in infrastructure costs were, and continue to be, necessary to mitigate the impact on our business and remain in compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement. While we do not anticipate that any of our lenders will be unable to lend under our revolving credit facility if we determine to borrow funds, no assurance can be given that one or more of our lenders will be able to fulfill their commitments. We do not depend on cash flows from discontinued operations or sales of assets to provide for future liquidity. Cash flows During the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $3.1 million as compared to the prior year.  In addition to the $287.1 million decrease in year-over-year net income, the decrease in cash flows from operating activities was the result of (i) our period-over-period decrease in working capital changes of $14.4 million, driven principally by increased payments of claims accrued in our self-insurance obligations in an effort to settle claims and the related funding of cash restricted for future settlements and (ii) a period-over-period increase of $304.7 million in non-cash adjustments to net income, principally related to the loss on asset impairment.  Increased center rent expense of $63.9 million and reduced interest expense of $23.3 million, which also resulted primarily from the Separation, contributed to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities.  All of these factors are discussed in “Results of Operations” above. Net cash used for investing activities of $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is comprised of (i) $44.1 million used for capital expenditures and (ii) $1.4 million used for acquisitions net of cash acquired, offset by  (iii) $1.8 million from proceeds from sale of assets. Net cash used for financing activities of $62.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 is comprised of (i) $61.2 million in principal repayments of long-term debt and capital lease obligations and (ii) $1.4 million deferred financing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $29.0 million as compared to the prior year.  This decrease was the result of (i) a year-over-year decrease in net income of $43.3 million, which is primarily driven by the transaction costs and loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the Separation, (ii) a year-over-year increase in working capital changes of $25.6 million due to timing differences and (iii) a $11.3 million decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income, principally related to deferred taxes offset by the loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization expenses and the provision for losses on accounts receivable. During the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $20.7 million as compared to the prior year.  This increase was the result of (i) a year-over-year decrease in net income of $70.6 million, (ii) a year-over-year increase in working capital changes of $5.2 million due to timing differences and (iii)     43    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES a $86.2 million increase in non-cash adjustments to net income, principally related to depreciation and amortization expenses, the provision for losses on accounts receivable and recognition of deferred taxes.   Loan agreements In October 2010, in connection with the Separation, we entered into a $285.0 million senior secured credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of financial institutions led by Credit Suisse, as administrative agent and collateral agent.  The Credit Agreement provides for $150.0 million in term loans ($89.8 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011), a $60.0 million revolving credit facility ($30.0 million of which may be utilized for letters of credit) and a $75.0 million letter of credit facility funded by proceeds of additional term loans ($72.6 million was utilized at December 31, 2011).  The revolving credit facility was undrawn on December 31, 2010. In addition to funding the letter of credit facility, the proceeds of the term loans were used to repay outstanding term loans under Old Sun’s credit agreement, which was concurrently terminated, to pay related fees and expenses and to provide funds for general corporate purposes.  The letter of credit facility replaced the letter of credit facility under Old Sun’s credit agreement.  The final maturity date of the term loans and the letter of credit facility is October 18, 2016 and the revolving credit facility terminates on October 18, 2015. In December 2011, we voluntarily paid down $50 million of term loans in conjunction with amending the Credit Agreement. The amendment increased our interest rate by 1.25% in return for greater flexibility with respect to our financial covenants. Availability of amounts under the revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with financial covenants, including an interest coverage test and a leverage covenant.  The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, such as a failure by us to make payment of amounts due, defaults under other agreements evidencing indebtedness, certain bankruptcy events and a change of control (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants restricting certain actions, including incurrence of indebtedness, liens, payment of dividends, repurchase of stock, acquisitions and dispositions, mergers and investments.  Our obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by most of our subsidiaries and are collateralized by our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries. Prior to the December 2011 amendments, amounts borrowed under the term loan facility were due in quarterly installments of $2.5 million, with the remaining principal amount due on the maturity date of the term loans.   However, our December 2011 voluntary repayment effectively satisfies any required quarterly principal payments until the facility’s maturity in 2016. Accrued interest is payable at the end of an interest period, but no less frequently than every three months.  Upon amendment, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal amount at a rate equal to an applicable percentage plus, at our option, either (a) the greater of 1.75% or LIBOR, adjusted for statutory reserves or (b) an alternative base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate announced by Credit Suisse, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, and (iii) the greater of 1.75% or one-month LIBOR adjusted for statutory reserves plus 1%.  As of December 31, 2011, the applicable percentage for term loans and revolving loans was 6.00% for alternative base rate loans and 7.00% for LIBOR loans.  Each year, commencing in 2012, within 90 days of the prior fiscal year end, we are required to prepay a portion of the term loans in an amount based on the prior year’s excess cash flows, if any, as defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition to paying interest on outstanding loans under the Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a facility fee of 0.50% per annum to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unused revolving commitments. Acquisitions In October 2011, we acquired the operating assets of Harbinger Hospice, Inc., a privately-held, Medicare-certified hospice company that provides services to patients in Ohio, for $1.1 million in cash, excluding    44    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES transaction costs of $0.1 million, consisting primarily of broker success fees, that were expensed during the fourth quarter of 2011 in accordance with GAAP.    In December 2010, we completed the purchase of a hospice company that operates in Alabama and Georgia for $13.9 million.  The purchase price included allocations of $5.9 million for intangible assets, $10.4 million for goodwill, and $0.3 million for net working capital and other assets. In October 2009 , we completed the purchase of a hospice company, which operates four hospice programs in three states in the New England area, for $16.1 million.  The purchase price included allocations of $6.3 million for intangible assets, $11.3 million for goodwill, and $1.5 million for net working capital and other assets. Assets held for sale We had no assets held for sale as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. During 2011, we disposed of a Maryland skilled nursing center in our Inpatient Services segment, whose results have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with GAAP.  The disposition, which was effective on August 1, 2011, resulted in cash proceeds to us of $1.8 million, net of our repayment of the related $5.2 million mortgage note.  During August 2011, we also divested two hospice operations in Oklahoma for a nominal price plus the assumption of certain liabilities by the buyer. The disposition resulted in a loss of $0.7 million, net of related tax benefit. During 2010, we disposed of our nurse practitioner services group of our Inpatient Services segment, whose results have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with GAAP.  During October 2009, we transferred operations of an assisted living center in Utah to an outside party.  This center has been classified as a discontinued operation. Capital expenditures We incurred capital expenditures, related primarily to improvements in continuing operations, of $44.1 million, $53.5 million, and $54.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   During the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $19.8 million of capital expenditures for ongoing normal operational needs of our centers, plus we expended $16.2 million for major renovations of our centers, including $3.5 million spent on our Rehab Recovery Suites.  We also incurred capital expenditures of $4.2 million in our Corporate segment for information systems and other needs. As of December 31, 2011, we had commitments for capital expenditures under various contracts of $8.5 million related to improvements at centers.  T hese commitments, and other expenditures in response to emergency situations at our centers, the amount of which we cannot predict, represent our non-discretionary capital expenditures.  The remaining amount of our 2012 planned capital expenditures is discretionary .  We expect to incur approximately $26.5 million to $31.5 million in capital expenditures during 2012, related primarily to improvements at existing centers and information system upgrades.    45    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Obligations and Commitments The following table provides information about our contractual obligations and commitments in future years as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):      Payments Due by Period                                            After        Total     2012     2013     2014     2015     2016     2016   Contractual Obligations:                                           Debt, including interest                                           payments (1)   $ 160,884     $ 15,173     $ 15,176     $ 14,708     $ 14,219     $ 101,608     $ -   Capital leases (2)     360       271       83       6       -       -       -   Capital expenditures     8,546       8,546       -       -       -       -       -   Purchase obligations (3)     375,560       148,080       123,980       60,480       43,020       -       -   Operating leases (4)     1,185,590       149,483       146,707       120,445       121,536       120,513       526,906   Other liabilities (5)     14,073       1,402       1,680       4,665       3,446       2,509       371                                                              Total   $ 1,745,013     $ 322,955     $ 287,626     $ 200,304     $ 182,221     $ 224,630     $ 527,277        Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period        Total                                            Amounts                                   After        Committed     2012     2013     2014     2015     2016     2016   Other Commercial Commitments:                                 Letters of credit (6)   $ 72,643     $ 72,643     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ -                                                              Total   $ 72,643     $ 72,643     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ -   (1) Debt includes principal payments and interest payments through the maturity dates.

(4) Some of our operating leases also have contingent rentals. (5) Represents $14.1 million of liability due to the previous shareholders of Harborside when certain tax benefits associated with that acquisition are realized.  Excludes liabilities for uncertain tax positions that are included in other liabilities at December 31, 2011 for which we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when, if at all, cash settlements with taxing authorities will occur. (6) Letters of credit expire annually but may be reissued pursuant to a $75.0 million letter of credit facility that terminates in October 2016. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. We believe the following are the most significant judgments and estimates affecting the accounting policies we use in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.    46    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Net revenues.   Net revenues consist of long-term and subacute care revenues, rehabilitation therapy revenues, and medical staffing services revenues. Net revenues are recognized as services are provided and billed. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for discount arrangements with commercial payors and contractual allowances with third-party payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid. Net revenues realizable under third-party payor agreements are subject to change due to examination and retroactive adjustment. Estimated third-party payor settlements are recorded in the period the related services are rendered. The methods of making such estimates are reviewed periodically, and differences between the net amounts accrued and subsequent settlements or estimates of expected settlements are reflected in current results of operations, when determined. Accounts receivable and related allowance.   Our accounts receivable relate to services provided by our various operating divisions to a variety of payors and customers. The primary payors for services provided in healthcare centers that we operate are the Medicare program and the various state Medicaid programs. The rehabilitation therapy service operations provide services to patients in nonaffiliated healthcare centers. The billings for those services are submitted to the nonaffiliated centers. Many of the nonaffiliated healthcare centers receive a large majority of their revenues from the Medicare program and the state Medicaid programs. Estimated provisions for losses on accounts receivable are recorded each period as an expense in the income statement.  In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, we consider a number of factors, including the age of the accounts, changes in collection patterns, the financial condition of our customers, the composition of patient accounts by payor type, the status of ongoing disputes with third-party payors and general industry conditions.  Any changes in these factors or in the actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss. Changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of change.  In addition, a retrospective collection analysis is performed within each operating company to test the adequacy of the reserve on a semi-annual basis. The allowance for doubtful accounts related to centers that we have divested was based on management’s expectation of collectability at the time of divestiture and was recorded in gain or loss on disposal of discontinued operations, net. As collections are recognized or new information becomes available, the allowance is adjusted as appropriate. As of December 31, 2011, accounts receivable for divested operations were significantly reserved. Insurance.   We self-insure for certain insurable risks, including general and professional liabilities, workers' compensation liabilities and employee health insurance liabilities through the use of self-insurance or retrospective and self-funded insurance policies and other hybrid policies, which vary by the states in which we operate. There is a risk that amounts funded to our self-insurance programs may not be sufficient to respond to all claims asserted under those programs.  Insurance reserves represent estimates of future claims payments. This liability includes an estimate of the development of reported losses and losses incurred but not reported. Provisions for changes in insurance reserves are made in the period of the related coverage.  An independent actuarial analysis is prepared twice a year to assist management in determining the adequacy of the self-insurance obligations booked as liabilities in our financial statements. The methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting reserves are reviewed periodically and are based on historical paid claims information and nationwide nursing home trends. Any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current earnings. Claims are paid over varying periods, and future payments may be different than the estimated reserves. We evaluate the adequacy of our self-insurance reserves on a quarterly basis and perform detailed actuarial analyses semi-annually in the second and fourth quarters. The analyses use generally accepted actuarial methods in evaluating the workers’ compensation reserves and general and professional liability reserves.  For both the workers’ compensation reserves and the general and professional liability reserves, those methods include reported and paid loss development methods, expected loss method and the reported and paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.  Reported loss methods focus on development of case reserves for incurred losses through claims closure. Paid loss methods focus on development of claims actually paid to date. Expected loss methods    47    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES are based upon an anticipated loss per unit of measure. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a combination of loss development methods and expected loss methods.   The foundation for most of these methods is our actual historical reported and/or paid loss data, over which we have effective internal controls. We utilize third-party administrators (“TPAs”) to process claims and to provide us with the data utilized in our semi-annual actuarial analyses. The TPAs are under the oversight of our in-house risk management and legal functions. These functions ensure that the claims are properly administered so that the historical data is reliable for estimation purposes. Case reserves, which are approved by our legal and risk management departments, are determined based on our estimate of the ultimate settlement and/or ultimate loss exposure of individual claims. In cases where our historical data are not statistically credible, stable, or mature, we supplement our experience with nursing home industry benchmark reporting and payment patterns. The use of multiple methods tends to eliminate any biases that one particular method might have. Management’s judgment based upon each method’s inherent limitations is applied when weighting the results of each method.  The results of each of the methods are estimates of ultimate losses, which include the case reserves plus an estimate for future development of these reserves based on past trends, and an estimate for losses incurred but not reported.   These results are compared by accident year and an estimated unpaid loss and allocated loss adjustment expense are determined for the open accident years based on judgment reflecting the range of estimates produced by the methods. Regarding our estimates for workers’ compensation reserves, there were no large or unusual settlements during the 2011 or 2010 period.  As of December 31, 2011, the discounting of the policy periods resulted in a reduction to our reserves of $14.1 million. There were no significant adverse developments to our general and professional liabilities reserves during 2011. During 2010, we determined that the previous estimates for general and professional liabilities reserves for matters related to years prior to 2010 were understated by $13.1 million due to adverse developments with respect to a number of claims that arose in prior periods. Accordingly, we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2010 to increase our general and professional liabilities reserves. Professional liability claims have a reporting tail that exceeds one year.  A significant component of our reserves is estimates for incidents that have been incurred but not reported. Impairment of assets. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies.  Our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $34.5 and $350.2 million, respectively.  Under GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; however, they are subject to annual impairment tests. Intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives.  The decrease in our goodwill during 2011 was primarily the result of an impairment charge, but partially offset by a hospice acquisition in our Inpatient Services segment. The purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.  We may engage independent third-party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for significant acquisitions.  Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance. GAAP requires that goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets be evaluated at least annually for    48    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES potential impairment and also when a triggering event occurs during an interim time period.  We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of each year.  GAAP requires that impairment be assessed for reporting units of the affected operating segments.  A reporting unit is a business for which discrete financial information is produced and reviewed by operating segment management and provides services that are distinct from the other components of the operating segment.  For our Inpatient Services reportable segment, the reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment analysis were determined to be the divisional operating levels.  The divisional operating levels of the Inpatient Services reportable segment include the northeast, southeast, central and west geographic divisions of SunBridge as well as the SolAmor hospice division and the Americare nutritional supplement division.  Our goodwill balances by reporting unit as of December 31, 2011 are (in thousands): Inpatient Services – SolAmor hospice division   $ 29,888   Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment     75   Medical Staffing Services segment     4,533   Total goodwill   $ 34,496   As a result of the CMS Final Rule, the prospective decrease in Medicare part A payment rates (i.e., the Medicare parity adjustment) is 12.6%.  Additionally, the CMS Final Rule changed group therapy reimbursement and introduced new change-of-therapy provisions as patients move through their post-acute stay that will further reduce our revenues from the Medicare program and/or increase our costs of providing such services.  We determined that the CMS Final Rule announcement constituted an interim triggering event in the third quarter of 2011 for evaluating whether the recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets in the divisional reporting units of our Inpatient Services reportable segment affected by the CMS Final Rule was impaired.  We recognized $317.1 million of non-cash loss on asset impairment for the SunBridge’s divisional reporting units in our Inpatient Services reportable segment.  The non-cash charges consisted of $314.7 million of goodwill impairment and $2.4 million of asset impairment for intangible assets for favorable lease obligations.  The charges were determined in the following manner: Finite-Lived Intangibles Our finite-lived intangibles include tradenames and favorable lease obligations. When evaluating the recoverability of tradenames, we considered projections of future profitability and undiscounted cash flows for the affected portions of the Inpatient Services operating segments as compared to the carrying value of the tradenames assets.  We determined that projected undiscounted cash flows were sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying value.  As a result, there was no impairment of tradenames during 2011. When evaluating the recoverability of favorable lease obligations, we considered projections of future profitability and undiscounted cash flows for the affected portions of the Inpatient Services operating segments as compared to the carrying value of the favorable lease obligation intangible assets.  We determined that projected undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the full carrying value of the assets and proceeded to determine a fair value of each asset. We determined fair value based upon estimates of market rental values for the centers associated with the favorable lease intangibles using valuations techniques broadly accepted by the long-term care industry in which we operate.  We applied an industry average discount factor to the difference of this estimated market rental values to our contractually obligated lease payments over the remaining term of the leases, resulting in an appropriate estimate of fair value for the favorable lease intangible.  We determined that certain favorable lease obligations had fair values less than their carrying values and recognized the $2.4 million loss on asset impairment described above.    49    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Our indefinite-lived intangibles consist of CONs obtained through our acquisitions.  We evaluate the recoverability of our CON intangibles by comparing the assets' respective carrying value to estimates of fair value. We determine the estimated fair value of these intangible assets through an estimate of incremental cash flows with the intangible assets versus cash flows without the intangible assets in place coupled with estimates of market pricing to determine the highest and best use for purposes of determining fair value.  The resulting fair values exceeded the assets’ carrying values and thus no impairment was recognized. Long-Lived Assets GAAP requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are not sufficient to recover the assets' carrying amounts.  In estimating the undiscounted projected cash flows for our impairment assessment, we primarily used our internally prepared projections and forecast information, including adjustments for the estimated impact of the CMS Final Rule.  We determined that undiscounted projected cash flows were sufficient to ensure recoverability of our long-lived assets. Goodwill GAAP requires that impairment be assessed for reporting units of the affected operating segments.  A reporting unit is a business for which discrete financial information is produced and reviewed by operating segment management and provides services that are distinct from the other components of the operating segment.  For our Inpatient Services reportable segment, the reporting units for our annual goodwill impairment analysis were determined to be the divisional operating levels.  The divisional operating levels of the Inpatient Services reportable segment include the northeast, southeast, central and west geographic divisions of SunBridge as well as the SolAmor hospice division and the Americare nutritional supplement division.   We determine potential impairment by comparing the net assets of each reporting unit to their respective fair values, which GAAP describes as Step 1 of goodwill impairment testing. We determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted projected cash flow analysis and other appropriate valuation methodologies.  In the event a unit's net assets exceed its fair value, an implied fair value of goodwill must be determined by assigning the unit's fair value to each asset and liability of the unit, which is referred to in GAAP as Step 2 of the impairment analysis. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.  An impairment loss is measured by the difference between the goodwill’s carrying value and its implied fair value. In estimating the projected cash flows for our impairment assessment, we primarily used our internally prepared projections and forecast information including adjustments for the estimated impact of the CMS Final Rule.  Other factors in the cash flow projections include anticipated funding from other payor sources such as Medicaid funding plus our plans to manage overhead costs, capital expenditures and patient care liability costs. The discounted cash flow model utilizes five years of projected cash flows for each reporting unit. The projected financial results are created from critical assumptions and estimates based upon management’s business plan and historical trends while giving consideration to the overall economic environment. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments about appropriate discount rates, business growth rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and market information relevant to our overall company value. In addition, to validate the reasonableness of our assumptions, we utilized our discounted cash flow model on a consolidated basis and compared the estimated fair value to our market    50    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES   capitalization as of September 30, 2011.  Key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model are as follows: Business Growth Assumptions – In determining our projected Inpatient Services revenue growth rates for our discounted cash flow model, we focus on the two primary drivers: average daily census (“ADC”) and reimbursement rates, particularly those rates impacted by the CMS Final Rule. Key revenue inputs include historical ADC adjusted for known trends and current Medicare and Medicaid rates adjusted for anticipated changes. ADC trends have been reasonably constant within a narrow range and may be influenced over the long run by a number of factors, including demographic changes in the population we serve and our ability to deliver quality service in an attractive environment. Generally, long term care reimbursement rates are set annually by the payor. To estimate these rates, we evaluate the current reimbursement climate and adjust historical trends where appropriate. Significant adverse rate changes in any one year would cause us to reevaluate our projected rates.  In recent years, we have generated historical revenue growth of 1.4% to 6.2% annually.  Expenses generally vary with ADC and have historically grown by approximately 2.9% to 5.6% annually.  Labor is the largest component of our expenses.  We consider labor market trends and staffing needs for the projected ADC levels in determining labor growth rates to be used in our projections. The projected growth rates used in our discounted cash flow model took into account the potential adverse effects of the current economic downturn on our projected revenue and expenses. Terminal Value EBITDAR Multiple – Consistent with commonly accepted valuation techniques, a terminal multiple for the final year’s projected results is applied to estimate our value in the final year of the analysis. That multiple is applied to the final year’s projected EBITDAR from continuing operations. Discount Rate – Market conditions indicated that a discount rate of 10.5% was appropriate at September 30, 2011.  This discount rate is consistent with our overall market capitalization comparison. We consistently apply the same discount rate to the evaluation of each reporting unit. The goodwill impairment analysis is subject to impact from uncertainties arising from such events as changes in economic or competitive conditions, the current general economic environment, material changes in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future operating conditions and cash flows, and the impact of strategic decisions.  The results of our interim 2011 impairment analysis showed that goodwill in each of SunBridge’s divisional reporting units tested was impaired.  Based on the analysis performed, we recognized a loss on impairment of $314.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, which represents the full carrying value of goodwill for the SunBridge divisional operating segments of our Inpatient Services reportable segment. The Step 1 results of our annual fourth quarter 2011 goodwill impairment analysis for our Inpatient Services SolAmor hospice division reporting unit, our Rehabilitation Therapy Services segment and our Medical Staffing Services segement showed that none were impaired as their fair value exceeded their carrying value. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Discussion of recent accounting pronouncements can be found in the “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” portion of Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, which is incorporated by reference in response to this item.    51    SUN HEALTHCARE GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Impact of Inflation CMS implemented net market basket increases of 1.7%, 2.3% and 2.2% to the Medicare reimbursement rates for Federal fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which increases were primarily intended to keep track with inflation. The CMS Final Rule for Federal fiscal year 2012 also had a 12.6% reduction for Medicare rate parity adjustment. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 27          ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   General   This section is intended to provide an understanding of the financial performance of White River through a discussion of the factors affecting White River’s financial condition at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and White River’s consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. This section should be read in conjunction with White River’s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this document. In addition to the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See “Discussion of Forward-Looking Statements.”     Critical Accounting Policies   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. White River believes that the following represents the material critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from estimates.     Allowance for Loan Losses – Finance Receivables   Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables.   The allowance for loan losses is established systematically by management based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date. Coastal Credit reviews charge off experience factors, delinquency reports, historical collection rates and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date. Assumptions regarding probable credit losses are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above. Should the credit loss assumptions increase, there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required, which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations. Coastal Credit believes that the existing allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable finance receivable losses.    19    Income Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, their respective tax basis and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.   The ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on White River’s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and its ability to avoid an ownership change for tax purposes. The valuation allowance has been derived pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes , and reduces the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will “more likely than not” be realized (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). As of December 31, 2011, there was no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits.     New Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2011-05 will supersede some of the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 220. The main provisions of this ASU provide that an entity that reports items of other comprehensive income has the option to present comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements: (i) a single statement must present the components of net income and total net income, the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income; (ii) in a two-statement approach, an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement. That statement must be immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income, a total for other comprehensive income, and a total for comprehensive income. The option in current GAAP that permits the presentation of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated. This ASU is effective beginning with the first quarter of 2012 and will have no material impact on the White River consolidated financial statements.   In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU No 2011-05”.  ASU 2011-12 delayed the effective date of certain requirements of ASU 2011-05 related to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income.     Results of Operations   The Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010   Net income was $9.5 million, or $2.64 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $7.1 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to an increase in interest on receivables of $2.4 million and a decrease of $2.4 million in provision for loan losses during 2011. This increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in total other expenses and income tax expense of $1.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively.        20      Discussion of Results   The following table presents consolidating financial information for White River for the periods indicated ($ in thousands):     For The Year Ended December 31, 2011   Coastal Credit     Corporate and Other     Consolidated                            Interest on receivables   $ 35,189     $ 2     $ 35,191                                  Interest expense     (1,852 )     (43 )     (1,895 )                                Net interest margin     33,337       (41 )     33,296                                  Provision for loan losses     (3,988 )     (6 )     (3,994 )                                Net interest margin (deficit) after provision for loan losses     29,349       (47 )     29,302                                  OTHER REVENUES (EXPENSES):                           Salaries and benefits     (8,648 )     (748 )     (9,396 )   Operating expenses     (3,257 )     (1,632 )     (4,889 )   Change in fair market valuation of creditor liabilities     —       43       43     Other income (expense)     (383 )     1       (382 )                                Total other expenses     (12,288 )     (2,336 )     (14,624 )                                Income (loss) before income taxes   $ 17,061     $ (2,383 )   $ 14,678                                                               For The Year Ended December 31, 2010   Coastal Credit     Corporate and Other     Consolidated                                  Interest on receivables   $ 32,808     $ 17     $ 32,825                                  Interest expense     (1,318 )     (174 )     (1,492 )                                Net interest margin     31,490       (157 )     31,333                                  Recovery (provision) for loan losses     (6,426 )     72       (6,354 )                                Net interest margin (deficit) after recovery (provision) for loan losses     25,064       (85 )     24,979                                  OTHER REVENUES (EXPENSES):                           Salaries and benefits     (8,290 )     (707 )     (8,997 )   Operating expenses     (3,164 )     (1,443 )     (4,607 )   Change in fair market valuation of creditor liabilities     —       179       179     Gain from deficiency account sale     —       37       37     Other income (expense)     (200 )     23       (177 )                                Total other expenses     (11,654 )     (1,911 )     (13,565 )                                Income (loss) before income taxes   $ 13,410     $ (1,996 )   $ 11,414     The Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 - Consolidated   Interest on receivables increased 7.2% to $35.2 million compared to $32.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. This increase is a result of an increase in the Coastal Credit average finance receivable, net of unearned finance charge income and discounts and fees to $113.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $100.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.   Interest expense was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The average line of credit was $62.3 million and $42.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   Provision for loan losses was $4.0 million compared to $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring Coastal Credit’s allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables.    21    Salaries and benefits increased to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily a result of performance based awards in addition to an increase in the number of employees at Coastal Credit during 2011.   Other operating expenses increased to $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Coastal Credit operating expenses remained relatively unchanged between these periods. Corporate and Other operating expenses increased $0.2 million between these periods.   Income tax expense was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The expense is based on the estimated effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Upon completion of its 2010 federal and state income tax returns in September 2011, White River determined that its estimated statutory tax rate, used to tax effect its temporary differences, had changed based on the 2010 state apportionment results.  Such new apportionments were the result of changes in volumes of business in various states which resulted in an increase in the estimated state tax effective rate which increased the overall statutory rates applied to White River’s temporary differences. This change in the effective rate resulted in an increase to the net deferred tax asset of approximately $176,000 which reduced income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011.     Financial Condition as of December 31, 2011 and 2010   Finance Receivables, Net   Finance receivables, net increased 18.6% to $114.7 million at December 31, 2011 as compared to $96.7 million at December 31, 2010. The finance receivables, net reflect the balances at Coastal Credit.  The increase is a result of Coastal Credit’s growth initiatives and the exploitation of market opportunities.  In this regard, White River and Coastal Credit, in connection with their managements’ periodic analysis of strategic options, from time to time review opportunities to purchase larger finance receivable portfolios from other financial institutions and finance companies, in addition to Coastal Credit’s ordinary course purchases of receivable contracts from franchised and independent dealers.   A significant number of contracts acquired by Coastal Credit are contracts made with borrowers who are in the United States military. As of December 31, 2011, 55.4% of the Coastal Credit receivables were with borrowers who are in the United States military as compared to 47.7% as of December 31, 2010. Coastal Credit believes that having in the portfolio a significant percentage of contracts for which the borrowers are United States military personnel contributes to lower payment delinquency and greater collection personnel efficiencies. Coastal Credit requests that all borrowers who are in the military use the military allotment system to make payments on their contracts. Under this allotment system, the borrower authorizes the military to make a payroll deduction for the amount of the borrower’s monthly contract payment and to direct this deduction payment to Coastal Credit on behalf of the borrower. Delinquency of payments on contracts paid by allotment historically has been less than delinquency of payments on contracts not paid by allotment. As a result, the collection effort associated with the military contracts requires substantially less time, allowing Coastal Credit’s collection staff to focus on non-military contracts.     Accrued Interest Payable   Accrued interest payable was $0.2 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $0.1 million at December 31, 2010.    22    Liquidity and Capital Resources for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010   Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $18.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.   Net cash used in investing activities was $22.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This change was primarily the result of the increase in finance receivables acquired by Coastal Credit during 2011 compared to 2010.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily resulted from the $25.0 million net increase in the line of credit. This activity was partially offset by the $3.4 million repurchase of White River common stock and $17.8 million of cash dividends paid. Net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily resulted from the $4.8 million repurchase of White River common stock and $18.7 million of cash dividends paid. This 2010 activity was partially offset by the net increase in the line of credit of $16.0 million.   At December 31, 2011, White River and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of $3.2 million compared to $3.3 million at December 31, 2010.   Coastal Credit has a revolving credit facility from a lending institution with a maximum borrowing limit at December 31, 2011 of $100.0 million. The original maturity date on the line of credit was December 31, 2011, but pursuant to a Fourth Amendment to Finance Agreement executed on November 9, 2011 between Coastal Credit and its line of credit lender, which became effective January 1, 2012, the maturity date has been extended for three years to December 31, 2014. The interest rate is the 1 month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.60%.  As of December 31, 2011, Coastal Credit had $81.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility as compared to $56.0 million as of December 31, 2010. Coastal Credit increased its draws on the line of credit to purchase finance receivables and to fund White River’s stock repurchase programs and dividend payments during 2011. Total availability under the line of credit at December 31, 2011 was $100.0 million based upon the level of eligible collateral, with $19.0 million available in excess of the amount utilized at December 31, 2011. The credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of Coastal Credit. In addition, White River has provided an unconditional corporate guaranty. Coastal Credit must maintain specified financial ratios within guidelines established by the lender. Interest is paid monthly at a variable rate, based on meeting certain financial criteria. The average rate during each of the months of December, 2011 and 2010 was LIBOR plus 2.60% which equated to 2.87% and 2.86%, respectively. There is an annual commitment fee of 1/8 of 1% on the average daily unused commitment. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, effective January 1, 2012, this annual commitment fee remained at 1/8 of 1% but will increase to 1/2 of 1% if the average unused portion of the commitment for such calendar month is less than or equal to 50% of the commitment. In the event of a significant pay down or an earlier retirement of the revolver commitment, Coastal Credit would sustain certain prepayment penalties. This facility limits distributions Coastal Credit may make to White River to 80% of Coastal Credit’s pre-tax net income.   White River’s sources of liquidity, as the parent company, are limited and consist of cash on hand and distributions by Coastal Credit (subject to restrictions under Coastal Credit’s credit facility).   On November 11, 2009, the Board of Directors reauthorized White River’s previously announced share repurchase program. Under this program, White River was authorized to repurchase up to 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock, from time to time and subject to market conditions, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  As of December 31, 2011, White River has repurchased all 500,000 shares of its outstanding common stock under the program for $7.7 million.      23    On August 11, 2011, White River announced that its Board of Directors approved a new program to repurchase, from time to time and subject to market conditions, up to 250,000 shares of White River’s outstanding common stock, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. As of December 31, 2011, White River has repurchased 62,829 shares of its outstanding common stock under the program for $1.2 million.   The following table summarizes the dividends declared during 2010 and 2011 by White River’s Board of Directors:     Date Dividend Declared    Record Date    Payment Date    Dividend Type    Cash Dividend Per Share    Total Divided Paid (in thousands)                                        February 22, 2010    March 3, 2010    March 12, 2010    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      995.6     May 6, 2010    May 17, 2010    May 28, 2010    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      980.7     August 2, 2010    August 12, 2010    August 26, 2010    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      938.7     November 2, 2010    November 12, 2010    November 22, 2010    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      938.7     November 30, 2010    December 9, 2010    December 21, 2010    Special Cash    $  4.00    $ 14,967.0     February 16, 2011    February 25, 2011    March 2, 2011    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      926.7     May 5, 2011    May 16, 2011    May 31, 2011    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      903.2     August 1, 2011    August 11, 2011    August 25, 2011    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      903.2     October 28, 2011    November 7, 2011    November 21, 2011    Quarterly Cash    $  0.25    $      883.1     November 28, 2011    December 8, 2011    December 22, 2011    Special Cash    $  4.00    $ 14,137.9     On February 3, 2012, White River announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents per share on its common stock to shareholders of record on February 13, 2012.  This quarterly dividend was paid on February 24, 2012.     Asset Quality   Set forth below is certain information concerning the credit loss experiences on the fixed rate retail automobile receivables of White River. There can be no assurance that future net credit loss experience on the receivables will be comparable to that set forth below. See “Discussion of Forward-Looking Statements.”        24      Finance Receivables – Coastal Credit   Delinquency experience of finance receivables at Coastal Credit, including unearned interest ($ in thousands):          December 31,          2011     2010                                  Finance receivables - gross balance   $ 137,277           $ 119,788                                            Delinquencies:                               30-59 days   $ 1,317       1.0 %   $ 1,209       1.0 %   60-89 days     689       0.5 %     538       0.4 %   90+ days     697       0.5 %     354       0.3 %   Total delinquencies   $ 2,703       2.0 %   $ 2,101       1.8 %   As a result of the nature of the customers in Coastal Credit’s portfolio, Coastal Credit considers the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses to be critical to its financial results. Coastal Credit has an allowance for loan losses that is calculated independent of the aggregate acquisition discounts and fees on finance receivables. Coastal Credit’s allowance for loan losses is based upon the historical rate at which (1) current loans, (2) contracts in a 30, 60 and 90+ day delinquency state and (3) loans ineligible for its borrowing line, have defaulted. These historical rates are evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis for current conditions. See “Discussion of Forward-Looking Statements.”   Allowance for loan losses of finance receivables ($ in thousands):          Years Ended December 31,          2011     2010                         Balance at beginning of period   $ 8,153     $ 8,085     Charge-offs     (6,964 )     (8,488 )   Recoveries     2,526       2,130     Provision for loan losses     3,988       6,426                          Balance at the end of the period   $ 7,703     $ 8,153                          Finance receivables, net of unearned finance charges   $ 135,514     $ 117,837                          Allowance for loan losses as a percent of finance receivables, net of unearned finance charges     5.68 %     6.92 %                        Net charge-offs as a percent of finance receivables, net of unearned finance charges     3.27 %     5.40 %                        Allowance for loan losses as a percent of net charge-offs     173.57 %     128.23 %      25      Market Developments   As the financial and credit markets continue to struggle to recover from the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis, some auto finance companies have experienced improved funding opportunities and increased originations, while others continue to experience limited sources of liquidity.  We believe White River is well positioned to continue operations and grow the company responsibly based on the following factors:   ·   Coastal Credit is not dependent on the securitization market for financing. ·   At December 31, 2011, there was $19.0 million available, in excess of the amount utilized, from the line of credit. ·   A Fourth Amendment to Finance Agreement executed on November 9, 2011 between Coastal Credit and its line of credit lender, which became effective January 1, 2012, extended the maturity date of Coastal Credit’s line of credit three years to December 31, 2014. ·   White River is well capitalized with an equity to asset ratio of 46.2% as of December 31, 2011. While there is never any guarantee White River will not be faced with the constrained financing scenarios seen by other auto finance companies during and since the recession, we believe White River is well positioned in this uncertain economic environment, and we expect to be able to fund normal business operations and meet our general liquidity needs for the next 12 months through access to the line of credit, cash flows from operations, and our other funding sources.   In addition, on July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act went into effect on July 21, 2011.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial industry participants alike, including several provisions that will profoundly affect how certain companies providing consumer financial products and services, such as Coastal Credit, will be regulated in the future. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has the authority to promulgate consumer protection regulations applicable to all entities offering consumer financial services or products, including non-bank commercial companies in the business of extending credit and servicing consumer loans. The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial industry participants of all types, many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Consequently, the Dodd-Frank Act is likely to affect our cost of doing business, it may limit or expand our permissible activities, and it may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas. The nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions and non-bank commercial companies, including as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, is very unpredictable at this time. The Company’s management continues to actively monitor the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and assess its probable impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and the Company in particular, continues to be uncertain.      26    Discussion of Forward-Looking Statements   The preceding Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are also made elsewhere in this report. White River publishes other forward-looking statements from time to time. Statements that are not historical in nature, including those containing words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “should,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We caution you to be aware of the speculative nature of “forward-looking statements.” Although these statements reflect White River’s good faith belief based on current expectations, estimates and projections about (among other things) the industry and the markets in which White River operates, they are not guarantees of future performance. Whether actual results will conform to management’s expectations and predictions is subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including:   ·   the risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;   ·   general economic, market, or business conditions;   ·   changes in economic variables, such as the availability of business and consumer credit, conditions in the housing market, energy costs, the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings, the rate of unemployment and the levels of consumer confidence and consumer debt;   ·   changes in interest rates, the cost of funds, and demand for White River’s financial services;   ·   the level and volatility of equity prices, commodity prices, currency values, investments, and other market fluctuations and other market indices;   ·   changes in White River’s competitive position;   ·   White River’s ability to manage growth;   ·   the opportunities that may be presented to and pursued by White River;   ·   competitive actions by other companies;   ·   changes in laws or regulations, including the impact of current, pending and future legislation and regulations, including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and legislation regarding U.S. fiscal policy;   ·   changes in the policies of federal or state regulators and agencies; and   ·   other circumstances, many of which are beyond White River’s control.   Consequently, all of White River’s forward-looking statements are qualified by these cautionary statements. White River may not realize the results anticipated by management or, even if White River substantially realizes the results management anticipates, the results may not have the consequences to, or effects on, White River or its business or operations that management expects. Such differences may be material. Except as required by applicable laws, White River does not intend to publish updates or revisions of any forward-looking statements management makes to reflect new information, future events or otherwise.     ITEM 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 49 ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.   General   As discussed previously, the Holding Company was incorporated for the primary purpose of owning all of the outstanding shares of River Valley Financial. As a result, the discussion that follows focuses on River Valley Financial’s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of December 31, 2011, and results of operations for periods prior to that date, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   In addition to the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements appear in a number of places in this Form 10-K and include statements regarding the intent, belief, outlook, estimate or expectations of the Company, its directors or its officers, primarily with respect to future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Readers are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future events or performance and involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s operations and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include, but are not limited to, changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and River Valley Financial’s general market area; loss of deposits and loan demand to other financial institutions; substantial changes in financial markets; changes in real estate values and the real estate market; regulatory changes; or turmoil and government intervention in the financial services industry. The forward-looking statements contained herein include those with respect to the effect future changes in interest rates may have on financial condition and results of operations, and management’s opinion as to the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations of recent accounting pronouncements not yet in effect.     Effect of Current Events   The global and U.S. economies have been experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of, among other factors, disruptions in the financial system for a prolonged period. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail.   Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. The availability of credit, confidence in the financial sector, and level of volatility in the financial markets have been significantly adversely affected as a result. The volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength.   Further adverse effects on the U.S. banking and financial industries as well as on the broader U.S. and global economies could have an adverse effect on the Company and its business.   The level of turmoil in the financial services industry continues to present unusual risks and challenges for the Company, as described below:   The Current Economic Environment Poses Challenges For Us and Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations . We are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain national conditions and local conditions in our markets. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for several years. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. Financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets. While we are taking steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets, and we are affected by these events.   Our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, and construction and land development loans. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition,    35    deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences: increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decline; deposits may decrease, which would adversely impact our liquidity position; and collateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers’ borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.   Impact of Recent and Future Legislation . Congress and the Treasury Department have adopted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system and declines in the housing market. The actual impact that measures undertaken to alleviate the credit crisis will have on the financial markets is unknown. The failure of such measures to help stabilize the financial markets, and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock. Finally, there can be no assurance regarding the specific impact that such measures may have on us and no assurance whether or to what extent we will be able to benefit from such programs.   In addition to the legislation mentioned above, federal and state governments could pass additional legislation responsive to current credit conditions. As an example, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the Bank’s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits the Bank’s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible.   Also, as described in Part I, Item 1 – Regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act will cause widespread changes, already eliminating the OTS and making the OCC the primary regulator of the Bank and the Federal Reserve the primary regulator of the Holding Company as of July 21, 2011. At this time, we cannot determine the specific impact this legislation will have on the Holding Company or the Bank.   Additional Increases in Insurance Premiums . The FDIC insures the Bank’s deposits up to certain limits. Current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures. The FDIC takes control of failed banks and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC charges us premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has set the Deposit Insurance Fund long-term target reserve ratio at 2% of insured deposits. Due to recent bank failures, the FDIC insurance fund reserve ratio has fallen below the statutory minimum. The FDIC has implemented a restoration plan beginning January 1, 2009, that is intended to return the reserve ratio to an acceptable level. Further increases in premium assessments are also possible and would increase the Company’s expenses. Effective with the June 2011 reporting period, the FDIC changed the assessment from a deposit-based assessment to an asset-based assessment, and reevaluated the base rate assessed to financial institutions. As a result of these changes, the Company experienced a decrease in premiums. However, increased assessment rates and special assessments could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.   The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us . Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.   Future Reduction in Liquidity in the Banking System . The Federal Reserve Bank has been providing vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system to compensate for weaknesses in short-term borrowing markets and other capital markets. A reduction in the Federal Reserve’s activities or capacity could reduce liquidity in the markets, thereby increasing funding costs to the Bank or reducing the availability of funds to the Bank to finance its existing operations.   Difficult Market Conditions Have Adversely Affected Our Industry . We are particularly exposed to downturns in the U.S. housing market. Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past several years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and securities and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities, major commercial and investment banks, and regional financial institutions. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers,    36    including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:   · We expect to face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.   · Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approach we use to select, manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors.   · The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.   · Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.   · Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.   · We may be required to pay significantly higher deposit insurance premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.   Concentrations of Real Estate Loans Could Subject the Company to Increased Risks in the Event of a Real Estate Recession or Natural Disaster . A significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio is secured by real estate. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our primary market area could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Historically, Indiana and Kentucky have experienced, on occasion, significant natural disasters, including tornadoes and floods. The availability of insurance for losses for such catastrophes is limited. Our operations could also be interrupted by such natural disasters. Acts of nature, including tornadoes and floods, which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures our loans or interruption in our business operations, may also negatively impact our operating results or financial condition.   We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks .   Our business employs systems and a website that allow for the secure storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business.     Critical Accounting Policies   Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2011. Certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, since they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses, analysis of other-than-temporary impairment on available-for-sale investments, and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights.     Allowance For Loan Losses   The allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management’s assumptions about specific borrowers and current economic and business conditions, among other factors. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The evaluation by management includes    37    consideration of past loss experience, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, the current economic condition, the amount of loans outstanding, identified problem loans, and the probability of collecting all amounts due.   The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in the Company’s loan portfolios. In determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, estimates and assessments.   The Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative, centralized credit policies, and uniform underwriting criteria for all loans as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit quality reviews and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.   The Company’s allowance consists of three components: probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans, probable losses estimated from historical loss rates, and probable losses resulting from economic or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance.   Larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review. Where appropriate, reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the Company. Included in the review of individual loans are those that are considered impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral. The Company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual. Historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations.   Homogenous loans, such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans, are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems are used to assess credit risks. Reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge-offs for one year. Loss rates are based on the average net charge-off history by loan category.   Historical loss rates for loans may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition. Factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies, trends in the nature and volume of loans (delinquencies, charge-offs and nonaccrual loans), changes in mix, asset quality trends, risk management and loan administration, changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards, collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the Company’s internal loan review. The portion of the allowance that is related to certain qualitative factors not specifically related to any one loan type is considered the unallocated portion of the reserve.   Allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience.   The Company’s primary market area for lending is comprised of Clark, Floyd and Jefferson Counties in southeastern Indiana and portions of northeastern Kentucky adjacent to that market. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Company’s customers.     Other-Than-Temporary Impairment   The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists pursuant to guidelines established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), in    38    ASC 320. In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies or government-sponsored agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of review of the issuer’s financial condition.   If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of the OTTI to be recognized in earnings. The Company’s consolidated statement of income would reflect the full impairment (that is, the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and fair value) on debt securities that the Company intends to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. For securities that management has no intent to sell, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment would be recognized in earnings, while the noncredit loss would be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected based on cash flow projections. The Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment during the year ended December 31, 2011.     Valuation of Mortgage Servicing Rights   The Company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Under the servicing assets and liabilities accounting guidance (ASC 860-50), servicing rights resulting from the sale or securitization of loans originated by the Company are initially measured at fair value at the date of transfer. Mortgage servicing rights are subsequently carried at the lower of the initial carrying value, adjusted for amortization, or fair value. Mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those rights. Factors included in the calculation of fair value of the mortgage servicing rights include estimating the present value of future net cash flows, market loan prepayment speeds for similar loans, discount rates, servicing costs, and other economic factors. Servicing rights are amortized over the estimated period of net servicing revenue. It is likely that these economic factors will change over the life of the mortgage servicing rights, resulting in different valuations of the mortgage servicing rights. The differing valuations will affect the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheet as well as the income recorded from loan servicing in the consolidated income statement. As of December 31, 2011, mortgage servicing rights had a carrying value of $641,000, which included a $26,000 valuation allowance for impairment on certain pools of servicing rights as of that date.     Discussion of Changes in Financial Condition from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011   At December 31, 2011, the Company’s consolidated assets totaled $406.6 million, an increase of $20.0 million, or 5.2%, from the December 31, 2010 total. The increase was primarily due to an increase in investment securities available for sale funded by a $18.9 million increase in deposits, period to period, and a $12.3 million decrease in loan receivables. Funds made available by these changes in deposit and loan levels were placed in investment securities available for sale, primarily U.S. government agency securities and to a lesser extent municipal securities and government-sponsored-enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securities. Investment securities available for sale of the Company increased $29.5 million, or 39.2%, for the period, from $75.2 million at December 31, 2010 to $104.7 million as of December 31, 2011. A portion of the increase in investment securities available for sale came from the mark-to-market changes with a net change of $2.1 million as the unrealized gain on the Company’s portfolio increased from $695,000 at December 31, 2010 to $2.8 million at December 31, 2011. The decrease in net loans, excluding loans held for sale, over the period, from $265.4 million at December 31, 2010 to $253.1 million at December 31, 2011, was reflective of the difficult lending environment which continued to affect loan production and of the equally difficult economy, as $4.8 million of real estate collateral for non-performing loans was foreclosed upon and transferred to real estate owned and held for sale (REO). Real estate owned as a result of foreclosure at December 31, 2011 totaled $2.5 million as compared to $400,000 at the same point in 2010, an increase of $2.1 million, period to period. Foreclosed real estate converted to REO during the period included a professional office building in New Albany, Indiana, a car wash in Charlestown, Indiana, an apartment complex in Scottsburg, Indiana, a condominium complex in New Albany, Indiana, a funeral home in Madison, Indiana, several building lots, and a few lesser residential properties. The Company closely monitored the values of these properties and additional charge downs were taken as necessary based on current fair value information such as appraisal data and pending sales offers. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011, the Company reduced income by $613,000 for these charge downs. Write down of real estate owned as a result of foreclosure is reported as a reduction of Other Income.    39    Liquidity for the Company continued to be strong, with the balances in cash and cash equivalents at $18.7 million as of December 31, 2011, as compared to balances of $16.8 million as of December 31, 2010. Amounts borrowed by the Company remained constant period to period at $65.2 million, with advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank representing the largest portion of those balances at $58.0 million at both dates. The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) is the Company’s primary source of wholesale funding. The average rates paid on those borrowings, however, decreased 29 basis points across the period, from 3.84% as of December 31, 2010 to 3.55% as of December 31, 2011, as the Company restructured $10.0 million in advances, taking advantage of lower borrowing costs to lock in advances over a range of terms, and repaid and replaced an additional $5.0 million. The drop in average rates, December 2010 to December 2011, resulted in a $791,000, or 25.1%, decrease in the cost of borrowing period to period. Borrowing costs of $2.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 compared to $3.2 million for the same period in 2010.   Other significant changes during the period included $270,000 received from the FHLB for a repurchase of FHLB stock and a decrease in the prepaid FDIC assessment of $360,000 over the period.   The difficult lending environment continued to challenge loan production for the Company. Total loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, decreased $12.3 million, or 4.6%, from $265.4 million at December 31, 2010 to $253.1 million at December 31, 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to $4.8 million in non-performing loans removed from the portfolio into real estate held for sale, $2.6 million in loans charged off, net of recoveries, and sales of conventional mortgages into the secondary market. Sales to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 were $24.0 million, including $1.1 million originated for sale at December 31, 2010 and sold in January 2011. These sales compare very closely to the $26.1 million in sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010. Sales into the secondary market are an important source of non-interest income for the Company.   The Company’s consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled $4.0 million at December 31, 2011, as compared to $3.8 million at December 31, 2010. Provision expense of $2.8 million for the period was offset by net charge-offs of $2.6 million. This compared to provision expense for the same period in 2010 of $2.6 million and net charge-offs of $1.5 million. Net charge-offs for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011 were primarily comprised of properties that have labored through the foreclosure process, most for as long as two to three years. For example, $604,000 was charged off for a variety of residential properties, including a $200,000 loan charged off due to bankruptcy. $1,056,000 was charged off for nonresidential and commercial real estate properties, including loans previously provisioned by specific reserve allocations and loans relating to a relationship with a local funeral home business. Finally, $819,000 was charged off for land loans, primarily the culmination of foreclosure proceedings with two development relationships in the south-central Indiana area. Funding for the allowance represented 1.56% of total loans as of December 31, 2011 as compared to 1.41% as of December 31, 2010.   Delinquency 30 or more days past due as of December 31, 2011 was $10.8 million, or 4.3% of total loans, as compared to $12.3 million, or 4.6%, at December 31, 2010. The 2011 decrease was due primarily to loan foreclosures that resulted in the real estate held for sale discussed above. On a positive note, delinquencies in general for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 were constant over the period, as compared to the dramatic increases seen in the prior two years.   Non-performing loans (defined as loans delinquent greater than 90 days and loans on nonaccrual status) as of December 31, 2011 were $9.9 million, compared to $10.4 million at December 31, 2010. Non-performing loans as a percent of net loans were 3.90% and 3.91%, respectively, for those periods. The total of non-performing loans and loans performing under a troubled debt restructuring agreement as of December 31, 2011 totaled $16.8 million, or 6.64% of net loans. This compares to $17.1 million and 6.45% of net loans at the same date in 2010. Non-performing levels are primarily comprised of loans in the lengthy process of foreclosure or debt that has been restructured.   As a significant part of its management of delinquent loans, the Bank continued to focus on the analysis of problem loans and adjustments of those loans to fair value through the establishment of specific reserves for potential losses. As of December 31, 2011, the Bank had $1.4 million in specific reserve allocations for potential losses. This compares to $1.2 million at the same point in 2010. The general reserve for loan losses was $2.6 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. As a percent of loans outstanding on these dates, the general reserve was 1.00% of total loans as of December 31, 2011 and 0.96% as of the same date in 2010.   While there was limited growth within certain loan types during 2011, in aggregate the loan portfolio shrunk and there was limited additional risk to the overall allowance due to growth. Any risk due to growth in these economically challenging times was mitigated by selective underwriting of the borrower and in increasing requirements for amount and type of collateral securing the debt. The Bank is conservative in its lending practices and does not originate the type of loans publicized as “sub-prime” and therefore does not anticipate delinquencies other than those normally associated with the economic trends of the Bank’s market areas. As of December 31, 2011,    40    those trends had improved locally, regionally, and nationally, with unemployment rates lower on average from the 2009 and 2010 rates. The expense for the provision for loan losses increased slightly from the 2010 amount of $2.6 million, to $2.8 million in 2011, an increase of 4.8%, primarily the result of management anticipating and recording higher charge-offs in 2011.   Although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 was adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances, there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods, which could negatively affect the Company’s results of operations. Management is diligent in monitoring delinquent loans and in the analysis of the factors affecting the allowance.   Deposits totaled $305.2 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $18.9 million, or 6.6%, from total deposits of $286.3 million at December 31, 2010. During the twelve-month period, noninterest-bearing transactional deposit accounts increased slightly by 4.3%, while interest-bearing accounts increased 6.8%, or $17.9 million. The increases were primarily seen in the Company’s NOW accounts, which increased by $30.7 million from $53.9 million at December 31, 2010 to $84.6 million at December 31, 2011. A significant portion of the change in NOW account balances came from movement out of Money Market Demand (MMDA) accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, with MMDA accounts decreasing $9.6 million, or 23.7%, over the twelve-month period and savings accounts decreasing $7.2 million, or 13.8%. Despite movement of funds from the certificate of deposit accounts during the period, as of December 31, 2011 certificate accounts in total had increased a slight $4.0 million, or 3.4% from $116.1 million at December 31, 2010 to $120.1 million at the same point in 2011. In the current rate environment borrowers appeared to be trading minimal differences in interest rates for accessibility to their funds in selecting the transactional accounts over the non-transactional.   As loan balances, and loan demand decreased and deposit levels continued to increase, the challenge to the Company was to place excess funds in earning assets, while maintaining the flexibility to meet interest rate risk challenges and provide sufficient, accessible liquidity for the Company. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, the Company met this challenge by purchasing investments specific to those purposes.   Investments reported in the financial statements of the Company are held both at the Bank level and at the Bank’s Nevada subsidiaries, and all are available for sale. The investment portfolio in total increased by 39.2% from $75.2 million as of December 31, 2010 to $104.7 million as of December 31, 2011, a dollar increase of $29.5 million, as the Company increased investments at the Bank level by $16.5 million, primarily in liquid agency investments, and by $13.0 million in investments held at the Nevada subsidiary level, primarily in income-earning mortgage-backed and municipal investments. For the period, agency investments increased a total of $15.4 million, from $22.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $37.9 million at the same point in 2011. Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed and other asset-backed agency securities increased over the period by $5.8 million, or 20.0%. Municipal investments increased by the same dollar amount, representing a percentage increase period to period of 25.6%, from $22.9 million at December 31 2010 to $28.7 million at December 31, 2011. $2.5 million in corporate investments were purchased at the Nevada subsidiary level during the twelve-month period, rounding out the overall increase in investment levels, period to period. Yields on investments declined from 3.44% in 2010 to 3.08% in 2011, reflective of the economy in general. The unrealized gain on investments increased significantly from $695,000 at December 31, 2010 to $2.8 million at the same point in 2011, again reflective of the economy in general.   The Company evaluates all investments for other than temporary impairment quarterly. 2011 brought continued scrutiny of the Company’s investments, and in particular of asset quality and changes in the fair values of the individual investments. The Company’s securities are valued at fair value by a pricing service whose prices can be corroborated by recent security trading activities. The Company’s portfolio is comprised of the following types of investments.   Agency investments, which includes AAA-rated Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC), Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) investments, at an average tax equivalent yield of 1.87%, were at a net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2011. No agency investments were at an unrealized loss position for 12 consecutive months or more. The total carrying value of $37.9 million represents 36.2% of the total investment portfolio. Agency investments are primarily held at the Bank level, for liquidity purposes.   Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, which includes governmentally guaranteed FNMA, FHLMC, and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) REMICs, at an average tax equivalent yield of 3.72%, were at a net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2011. No collateralized mortgage obligation investments were at an unrealized loss position for 12 consecutive months or more. The total carrying value of $16.2 million represents 15.5% of the total investment portfolio.    41    Government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) residential mortgage-backed securities, which includes governmentally guaranteed FNMA, GNMA, and FHLMC Gold pools, at an average tax equivalent yield of 3.36%, were at a net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2011. No mortgage-backed investments were at an unrealized loss position for 12 consecutive months or more. The total carrying value of $18.5 million represents 17.6% of the total investment portfolio.   Municipal securities from a variety of sources, with an average tax equivalent yield of 5.98%, were at a net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2011. The portfolio is comprised of both general obligation (GO) bonds and revenue bonds. The total carrying value of $28.7 million represents 27.4% of the total investment portfolio. At December 31, 2011, two investments, totaling $773,000, had been at an unrealized loss for 12 consecutive months or more. However, because the Company expects full repayment of these investments, does not intend to sell the investments prior to maturity, and because it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.   Corporate investments, comprised of five “A2” or higher rated corporate stocks (Moody’s rated) and two inactively traded trust preferred issues, with a total average tax equivalent yield of 1.93%, were at a net unrealized loss position at December 31, 2011. Both trust preferred investments were at an unrealized loss for 12 consecutive months or more. The corporate stocks were purchased in the third quarter of 2011 and were at a continuous loss position for the remainder of 2011. Because the Company expects full repayment of these investments, does not intend to sell the investments prior to maturity, and because it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011. These investments, with total carrying value of $3.3 million, represent 3.2% of the total investment portfolio. Both issues of trust preferred securities represent some potential risk to the Company simply by virtue of their attributes. They are discussed individually below.   The ALESCO 9A class A2A (ALESCO 9A) investment and the Preferred Term Security XXVII, LTD class A-1 (PRETSL XXVII) investment are both thinly traded. Both issues are backed by financial institutions and insurance companies, and the current pricing reflects inactivity in the markets for trust preferred issues. As the national economic woes have continued some of the underlying financial institutions have defaulted on or deferred interest payments. Some curing of these defaults have ocurred as conditions improve. While these defaults/deferrals may negatively affect the lower tranches of the issues, the Bank holds the top tranche of PRETSL XXVII and the second highest tranche of ALESCO 9A. The collateralization levels on these issues are still more than adequate for the Bank to be protected. Both cash flow and other analysis, performed by independent third party analysts, and reviewed by management, indicate that it is more than likely that these investments will continue to maturity, and are thus only temporarily impaired. Cash flow analysis indicates that full payment of the tranches held by the Bank is expected by maturity, if not before.   In November 2007, the Company purchased $1.0 million face value of ALESCO 9A trust preferred stock at a price of $88.81 ($888,100). At December 31, 2011, this investment was priced by a third party pricing service and was carried on the Company’s books at a market value of $488,000 and at an amortized cost on that date of $900,000. The net unrealized loss on this investment at December 31, 2011 was $412,000. These figures as of December 31, 2010 were: market value of $366,000, amortized cost of $896,000, and net unrealized loss of $530,000, indicating improvement period to period. 2010 levels were all improvements over 2009, indicating a trend of improvement in the investment. The Company has reviewed the pricing analytics reports for this investment and has determined that the decline in the market price of this investment is temporary and indicates thin trading activity, rather than a true decline in the value of the investment. Factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or “tranche” held by the Company, A2A, the projected cash flows as of December 31, 2011, which indicate that the Company will receive all contractual payments on or before maturity, and the current collateral position of the tranche, 125.61%, which while below the trigger collateralization of 146.20%, still reflects sufficient coverage for the tranche. The interest coverage ratio is 277.5%, on a trigger amount of 125.00%, indicating strong coverage for interest payments to the “A” tranche. Because the Company does not intend to sell this investment and because it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell this investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.   In February 2008, the Company purchased $1.0 million face value of PRETSL XXVII trust preferred stock at a price of $90.00 ($900,000). At December 31, 2011, this investment was priced by a third party pricing service and was carried on the Company’s books at a market value of $603,000 and at an amortized cost on that date of $862,000. The net unrealized loss on this investment at December 31, 2011 was $259,000. These figures as of December 31, 2010 were: market value of $570,000, amortized cost of $872,000, and net unrealized loss of $302,000, indicating improvement period to period. The investment has received quarterly paydowns of principal for the entire period the    42    Company has held the investment. The Company has reviewed the pricing analytics reports for this investment and has determined that the decline in the market price of this investment is temporary and indicates thin trading activity, rather than a true decline in the value of the investment. Factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or “tranche” held by the Company, A-1, the current collateral position of the tranche, 145.54%, and the projected cash flows as of December 31, 2011, which indicate that the Company will receive all contractual payments on or before maturity. Because the Company does not intend to sell this investment and because it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell this investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider this investment to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.   Other liabilities totaled $2.8 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $260,000 from the December 31, 2010 balance of $3.1 million, primarily due to changes in escrowed balances and deferred tax liabilities.   Stockholders’ equity totaled $33.0 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $1.5 million, or 4.8%, from the $31.5 million at December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the change in unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities, at a gain position of $1.8 million at December 31, 2011, as compared to $443,000 at December 31, 2010, and year-to-date earnings of $1.8 million. During the twelve months ending December 31, 2011, $55,000 was used to purchase 3,500 shares of Company stock, in satisfaction of two awards under one of the corporate employee benefit plans, and the Company paid dividends totaling $1.6 million to preferred and common shareholders. Dividends to common shareholders for the twelve-month period were $.84 per share.   The Bank is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital pursuant to federal regulations. At December 31, 2011, the Bank’s regulatory capital exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements.     Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010   General   River Valley’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, totaled $1.8 million, a decrease of $548,000, or 23.6%, from net income of $2.3 million reported for the same period in 2010. The change in income period to period was comprised of a variety of changes that occurred over the period. Total interest income decreased $922,000, or 4.95%, from $18.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to $17.7 million for the same period in 2011, as yields and average balances on interest-earning assets dropped. Offsetting the decrease in interest income was a more dramatic decrease in interest expense, with interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 decreasing $1.5 million, or 20.2%, from $7.3 million for the twelve-month period in 2010 to $5.8 million for the same period in 2011, as deposit and borrowing average costs of funds dropped from 2.18% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010 to 1.74% for the same period in 2011. These changes continued to benefit the Company during the year, with net interest income of $11.9 million as compared to $11.3 million at the same point in 2010, an increase of $556,000, or 4.9%. This slight increase, however, was insufficient to offset the increase in the combination of the provision expense, year to year, of $2.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $2.6 million for the same period a year before, and the more signficant reduction in noninterest income that came from write down of real estate owned as a result of foreclosure, of $613,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $75,000 for the same period in 2010. Other significant factors affecting net income for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011 were increases in salaries and benefits, as professional personnel were added, and in professional fees associated with acquisition activities of the Company.   With the decrease in pre-tax income, income tax expense decreased, with the effective tax rate for 2010 of 19.2% decreasing to 5.5% for 2011. Income from municipal investments held at the Company’s Nevada subsidiaries and increases in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance continue to contribute to the effective tax rate as the percentage of non-taxable income to total income remains elevated.     Net Interest Income   Total interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $17.7 million, a decrease of $992,000, or 4.95%, from the 2010 total of $18.6 million. The average balance of interest-earning assets outstanding year-to-year increased only slightly, by $1.0 million, or 0.2%, as loan receivables decreased, interest-earning deposits remained strong, and available-for-sale investment balances increased.   The average balance of loans receivable for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011 decreased 3.9%, or $10.6 million, over the same period in 2010. With a modest change in yields, 5.79% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 5.63% for the same period in 2010, interest income from loans receivable decreased 6.6%, to $14.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2011, from $15.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2010.    43    The average balance of investments increased $12.1 million, from $77.1 million in 2010 to $89.2 million in 2011. Interest income on investment securities was almost identical for the two years, at $2.7 million, as the increase in average balances was not able to overcome the dramatic decline in yields, with the average yield for 2011 of 3.08% as compared to 3.44% in 2010. As in 2010, the Company took advantage of gain positions on some investments with gain on sale for 2011 of $312,000 comparable to $347,000 for the same period a year earlier. Investments held at the Bank level are held primarily for liquidity purposes, whereas longer termed asset-backed and municipal securities, used for investment purposes, are held at a Nevada subsidiary.   Interest-earning deposits held by the Company remained constant, period to period, with the average balance of those deposits being $15.7 million for 2011, as compared to $15.9 million for 2010, a negligible decrease. Income from interest-earning deposits increased from $32,000 for the period ended December 31, 2010 to $34,000 for the period ended December 31, 2011 as the Company continued to take advantage of slightly better rates through the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed), leaving daily balances at the Fed rather than moving them to overnight accounts elsewhere.   For the period ending December 31, 2011, total interest expense was $5.8 million, a significant drop of $1.5 million, or 20.2%, from the $7.3 million for the period ended December 31, 2010. Interest expense for the Company is comprised of interest on funds deposited with the Company and expense on borrowings by the Company.   The average of total deposits increased from $286.6 million at December 31, 2010 to $295.0 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $8.4 million, or 2.9%. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased from $262.7 million at December 31, 2010 to $270.0 million at December 31, 2011, an increase of $7.3 million, or 2.8%. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits dropped from 1.58% to 1.28%, 2010 to 2011, with total interest expense on deposits for the period ending December 31, 2011 at $3.5 million, down $687,000, or 16.6%, from the $4.1 million for the period ending December 31, 2010. Over the same period, the cost of borrowings dropped from 4.40% to 3.64%, a dollar drop of $791,000, or 25.0%, as borrowings were repaid with excess funds from deposits and remaining borrowings were at a lower average cost. Total interest expense for borrowings for the period ended December 31, 2011 was $2.4 million, as compared to $3.2 million for the same period ended 2010.   In summary, during the period ending December 31, 2011, the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings dropped to a greater extent than the yields on interest-earning assets, a benefit to net interest income in total. Net interest income for the period ending December 31, 2011 was $11.9 million, up $556,000, or 4.9%, from the $11.3 million for the same period ending December 31, 2010.     Provision for Losses on Loans   A provision for losses on loans is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based upon historical experience, the volume and type of lending conducted by the Company, the status of past due principal and interest payment, general economic conditions, particularly as such conditions relate to the Company’s market area, and other factors related to the collectibility of the Company’s loan portfolio. As a result of such analysis, management recorded a $2.8 million provision for losses on loans for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2010. The 2011 expense of $2.8 million was primarily impacted by the culmination of foreclosure activity on two large relationships, for which some reserves had been established, and reserves established for current foreclosure relationships. The Company is diligent in assessing the status of problem loans, including those in the lengthy process of foreclosure. The 2011 expense corresponds to the annual expenses for 2009, of $2.9 million, and 2010, of $2.6 million, and reflects the loss experience of the Company projected for the continuing stagnation in the economy. Delinquencies in total have remained constant as foreclosures pending during the last 12 to 18 months have been resolved, and new delinquencies remain controlled.   Non-performing loans (defined as loans delinquent greater than 90 days and loans on nonaccrual status) plus troubled debt restructured as of December 31, 2011 were $16.8 million, compared to $17.1 million at December 31, 2010. Non-performing loans and troubled debt restructured as a percent of net loans were 6.64% and 6.45%, respectively, for those periods. Non-performing levels are primarily comprised of loans in the lengthy process of foreclosure or debt that has been restructured.   Of total non-performing loans, approximately $1.9 million have been past due for twelve months or more, have been reduced by partial charge-off of confirmed losses or protected by specific reserve allocations, and are in the lengthy process of work out or foreclosure. Non-performing loans of the Company average 388 days past due, emphasizing the fact that these are loans that have been moving slowly through the foreclosure process for a period of time. From time to time, the Company may be required to charge down loans that are performing loans because of collateral shortfalls identified through appraisal review or other methods. Total loans that have been reduced for confirmed loss amounts through partial charge-off or specific reserve allocations as of December 31, 2011 totaled $5.8 million, net of those reserves, with $4.3 million of that relating to loans that are performing according to the terms of their    44    agreements. While management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate at December 31, 2011, based upon the available facts and circumstances, there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to cover losses on non-performing assets in the future.     Other Income   Other income decreased by $894,000, or 22.9%, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 to $3.0 million, as compared to the $3.9 million reported for the same period in 2010. The decrease was due primarily to net losses on premises, equipment and other real estate owned (REO) as the Company recorded fair value adjustments (write-downs of the value) to REO of $613,000 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2011. Net losses on premises, equipment and other real estate owned, which includes those fair value adjustments, were $750,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $74,000 for the same period in 2010, a change of $676,000. Typically, the Company relies on sources of other income to supplement interest income, and offset expense increases. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, those other sources of income were unable to recoup the losses caused by the write down of other real estate owned. Overall, income from other sources was flat, period to period, with the following negligible activity: a slight decrease in service charges, primarily relating to overdrawn accounts, $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $2.0 million for the same period in 2010; a slight decrease in gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities, $312,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $347,000 for the same period in 2010; and only a negligible increase in gains on the sale of loans into the secondary market, primarily to Freddie Mac, $730,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $721,000 for the same twelve months in 2010. The trend for the sale of loans into the secondary market is expected to continue into 2012 because origination of loans for sale is expected to be minimal as underwriting continues to be tight and refinance activity weak. Income from service charges, such as that for overdraft of deposit accounts, is dependent upon consumer practices, and somewhat upon regulatory pressures to reduce such fees. Finally, income from the gain on sale of available for sale investments is dependent upon the market for such gains and management’s assessment of the wisdom of such action. Unlike interest income, “Other Income” is not always readily predictable and is subject to variations depending on outside influences, including regulatory changes.     Other Expenses   Total other expenses experienced a greater change period to period, with a net increase of $533,000, or 5.5%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. In general, increases were experienced in several financial statement lines. The most significant financial statement changes, both increases and decreases, were:   Salaries and employee benefits, a 5.9% increase period to period, from $5.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 to $5.3 million for the same period in 2011. This reflects the addition of professional and branch personnel and increases in benefits, including health insurance increases.   Net occupancy and equipment expenses, a 7.5% increase period to period, reflective of the addition of branches added during 2010 and information technology.   Professional fees, which include legal, accounting, and other third party contracted expenses, increased $201,000, or 57.4%, from $350,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010 to $551,000 for the same period in 2011. This increase is primarily due to legal fees associated with acquisition activity of the Bank, and regulatory mandates requiring additional third party review for financial institutions.   FDIC assessments for the twelve-month periods decreased $66,000, or 14.3%, 2010 to 2011, as the FDIC moved from a deposit-based assessment to an asset-based assessment and decreased the base rate for the Company.   Data processing fees decreased 12.5%, period to period, from $480,000 for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010 to $420,000 for the same period ended December 31, 2011, due to cost containment measures.   Other administrative costs, including advertising and office supply costs, decreased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, reflecting corporate cost containment measures.     Income Taxes   Tax expense of $103,000 was recorded for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $552,000 for the comparable period in 2010. For the 2011 period, the Company had pre-tax income of $1.9 million, as compared to $2.9 million for the 2010 period. The decrease in taxable income as a percent of total income, aided by increases in non-taxable income as a percent of total income, was responsible for the decrease in the effective tax rate . The effective tax rate was 5.5% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 19.2% for the same period in 2010. The tax calculations for both periods include the benefit of tax-exempt income from municipal investments and cash surrender life insurance, partially offset by the effect of nondeductible expenses.      45    Average Balance, Yield, Rate and Volume Data   The following table presents certain information relating to River Valley’s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing annual income or expense by the average daily balance of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the years presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances, which include nonaccruing loans in the loan portfolio.      Year Ended December 31,        2011     2010     2009        Average outstanding balance   Interest earned/paid   Yield/rate     Average outstanding balance   Interest earned/ paid   Yield/rate     Average outstanding balance   Interest earned/ paid   Yield/rate   Assets   (Dollars in thousands)   Interest-earning assets:                                           Interest-earning deposits   $ 15,722   $ 34   0.22 %   $ 15,948   $ 32   0.20 %   $ 14,600   $ 17   0.12 % Other securities (1)     57,787     1,644   2.84       48,137     1,481   3.08       46,820     1,748   3.73   Mortgage-backed securities (1)     31,394     1,105   3.52       29,009     1,171   4.04       21,430     978   4.56   Loans receivable (2)     263,209     14,818   5.63       273,772     15,859   5.79       281,048     16,305   5.80   FHLB stock     4,339     111   2.56       4,791     91   1.90       4,850     139   2.87   Total interest-earning assets     372,451     17,712   4.76       371,657     18,634   5.01       368,748     19,187   5.20   Noninterest earning assets, net of allowance for loan losses     23,723                 21,707                 20,795             Total assets   $ 396,174               $ 393,364               $ 389,543             Liabilities/shareholder equity                                                       Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                       Savings deposits   $ 77,565   $ 507   0.65 %   $ 97,793   $ 1,194   1.22 %   $ 85,785   $ 1,341   1.56 % Interest-bearing demand     72.383     452   0.62       50,466     234   0.46       50,842     313   0.62   Certificates of deposit     120,084     2,499   2.08       114,473     2,717   2.37       109,469     3,459   3.16   FHLB advances and other borrowings     64,884     2,365   3.64       71,717     3,156   4.40       90,720     4,209   4.64   Total interest-bearing liabilities     334,916     5,823   1.74       334,449     7,301   2.18       336,816     9,322   2.77   Other liabilities     28,479                 26,840                 26,581             Total liabilities (3)     363,395                 361,289                 363,397             Total equity     32,779                 32,075                 26,146             Total liabilities and equity   $ 396,174               $ 393,364               $ 389,543             Net interest-earning assets   $ 37,535               $ 37,208               $ 31,932             Net interest income         $ 11,889               $ 11,333               $ 9,865       Interest rate spread (4)               3.02 %               2.83 %               2.43 % Net yield on weighted average interest-earning assets (5)               3.19 %               3.05 %               2.68 % Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities               111.21 %               111.13 %               109.48 % ______________ (1) Includes securities available for sale at amortized cost prior to fair value adjustments.

(3) Includes Noninterest Demand Deposit Accounts of $24,945, $23,858 and $24,332, previously reported as part of total interest-bearing liabilities. (4) Interest rate spread is calculated by subtracting weighted average interest rate cost from weighted average interest rate yield for the period indicated. (5) The net yield on weighted average interest-earning assets is calculated by dividing net interest income by weighted average interest-earning assets for the period indicated.    46    Rate/Volume Table   The following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected River Valley’s interest income and expense during the years indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume), and (iii) total changes in rate and volume. The combined effects of changes in both volume and rate, which cannot be separately identified, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate:          Year Ended December 31,          2011 vs. 2010     2010 vs. 2009          Volume     Increase (decrease) due to Rate     Total     Volume     Increase (decrease) due to Rate     Total          (In thousands)     Interest-earning assets:                                       Interest-earning deposits and other   $ (9 )   $ 31     $ 22     $ -     $ (33 )   $ (33 )   Investment securities     372       (275 )     97       364       (438 )     (74 )   Loans receivable, net     (602 )     (439 )     (1,041 )     (422 )     (24 )     (446 )   Total     (239 )     (683 )     (922 )     (58 )     (495 )     (553 )   Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                   Deposits     38       (725 )     (687 )     379       (1,347 )     (968 )   FHLB advances and other borrowings     (282 )     (509 )     (791 )     (845 )     (208 )     (1,053 )   Total     (244 )     (1,234 )     (1,478 )     (466 )     (1,555 )     (2,021 )   Change in net interest income   $ 5     $ 551     $ 556     $ 408     $ 1,060     $ 1,468   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company’s principal sources of funds are deposits, loan and mortgage-backed securities repayments, maturities of securities, borrowings and other funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable, deposit flows and loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments are more influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. The Company maintains investments in liquid assets based upon management’s assessment of (1) the need for funds, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) the yield available on short-term liquid assets and (4) the objectives of the asset/liability management program.   At December 31, 2011, the Bank had commitments to originate loans totaling $11.7 million and in addition, had undisbursed loans in process, unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling $30.5 million.   At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $1.8 million in commitments to sell loans.   OCC regulations require the Bank to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation. The Company considers the Bank’s liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet outstanding short- and long-term needs.    47    The Company’s liquidity, primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a result of the funds provided by or used in the Company’s operating, investing and financing activities. These activities are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:          Year Ended December 31,          2011     2010     2009          (In thousands)                            Cash flows from operating activities   $ 5,862     $ 5,202     $ 2,581                                  Cash flows from investing activities:                           Purchase of securities     (47,826 )     (23,277 )     (51,513 )   Proceeds from maturities of securities     10,533       17,224       20,638     Proceeds from sales of securities     10,201       10,655       4,736     Net loan originations     4,658       7,582       5,143     Proceeds from sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure     2,024       590       539     Other     (773 )     (578 )     (282 )                                Cash flows from financing activities:                           Net increase (decrease) in deposits     18,889       8,594       28,809     Net increase (decrease) in borrowings     —       (21,000 )     (11,000 )   Purchase of stock     (55 )     —       —     Issuance of preferred stock     —       —       5,000     Other     (1,587 )     (1,591 )     (1,297 )                                Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ 1,926     $ 3,401     $ 3,354     The Bank is required by applicable law and regulation to meet certain minimum capital standards. Such capital standards include a tangible capital requirement, a core capital requirement, or leverage ratio, and a risk-based capital requirement.   The tangible capital requirement requires savings associations to maintain “tangible capital” of not less than 1.5% of the association’s adjusted total assets. Tangible capital is defined in OCC regulations as core capital minus intangible assets. “Core capital” is comprised of common shareholders’ equity (including retained earnings), noncumulative preferred stock and related surplus, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual associations. OCC regulations require savings associations to maintain core capital generally equal to 4% of the association’s total assets except those associations with the highest examination rating and acceptable levels of risk.   OCC regulations require that savings associations maintain “risk-based capital” in an amount not less than 8% of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-based capital is defined as core capital plus certain additional items of capital, which in the case of the Bank includes a general loan loss allowance of $2.6 million at December 31, 2011.   The Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2011. The following table summarizes the Bank’s regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital at December 31, 2011:          OCC Requirement     Actual Amount              Percent of Assets   Amount     Percent of Assets (1)   Amount     Amount of Excess        (Dollars in thousands)            Tangible capital   1.50 %   $ 6,074     9.25 %   $ 37,449     $ 31,375   Core capital   4.00       16,197     9.25 %     37,449       21,252   Risk-based capital   8.00       21,804     14.68 %     40,015       18,211       __________________________________________________   (1) Tangible and core capital levels are shown as a percentage of total assets; risk-based capital levels are shown as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.      48    Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices   The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the Company to measure financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars, with the exception of investment and mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered.   In management’s opinion, changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation, they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the rate of inflation. Rather, interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation, as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policies.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company’s financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement, or other contractual arrangement to which any entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party and under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.     ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   Not applicable for Smaller Reporting Companies.    49    		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 51    Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Executive   Summary   LSB Financial Corp., an Indiana corporation (“LSB Financial” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Lafayette Savings Bank, FSB (“Lafayette Savings” or the “Bank”). LSB Financial has no separate operations and its business consists only of the business of Lafayette Savings. References in this Annual Report to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to LSB Financial and/or Lafayette Savings as the context requires.   Lafayette Savings is, and intends to continue to be, an independent, community-oriented financial institution. The Bank has been in business for 142 years and differs from many of our competitors by having a local board and local decision-making in all areas of business. In general, our business consists of attracting or acquiring deposits and lending that money out primarily as real estate loans to construct and purchase single-family residential properties, multi-family and commercial properties and to fund land development projects. We also make a limited number of commercial business and consumer loans.   We have an experienced and committed staff and enjoy a good reputation for serving the people of the community, for understanding their financial needs and for finding a way to meet those needs. We contribute time and money to improve the quality of life in our market area and many of our employees volunteer for local non-profit agencies. We believe this sets us apart from the other 22 banks and credit unions that compete with us. We also believe that operating independently under the same name for over 142 years is a benefit to us - especially as local offices of large banks often have less local authority as their companies strive to consolidate. Focusing time and resources on acquiring customers who may be feeling disenfranchised by their no-longer-local or very large bank has proved to be a successful strategy.   In these extraordinary economic times, we find ourselves in a community that to some extent has been sheltered from the worst effects of the slowdown. The Greater Lafayette area enjoys diverse employment including major      35    manufacturers such as Subaru/Toyota, Caterpillar, and Wabash National; a strong education sector with Purdue University and a large local campus of Ivy Tech Community College; government offices of Lafayette, West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County; a growing high-tech presence with the Purdue Research Park; and the growth of a new medical corridor spurred by the building of two new hospitals. The area’s diversity did not make us immune to the effects of the recession, but we were spared its worst effects. Current signs of recovery, based on a report from Greater Lafayette Commerce, include increasing manufacturing employment, a continuing commitment to new facilities and renovations at Purdue University, and signs of renewed activity in residential development projects. Capital investments announced and/or made in 2011 totaled $444 million compared to $640 million in 2010 and $341 million in 2009. Wabash National, the area’s second largest industrial employer, continues to hire and intends to employ up to 200 more for a new line for production of bulk liquid storage containers. Subaru, the area’s largest industrial employer and producer of the Subaru Legacy, Outback and Tribeca, has increased employment and is investing between $14 million and $19 million for the 2013 Legacy and Outback engine model. Nanshan America will be opening an aluminum extrusion plant in Lafayette in 2012 employing 200 people. Alcoa will be adding a 115,000 square foot aluminum lithium plant to begin production in 2014. Growth in the medical corridor has continued with numerous clinics and specialized care facilities underway, which along with the two new hospitals makes Greater Lafayette a regional healthcare hub. In the education sector, Purdue’s West Lafayette 2012 enrollment was down slightly from last year to just under 40,000 students and Ivy Tech’s was over 7,600 students. The Purdue Research Park includes 110 high-tech and life science businesses and has more than 3,700 employees earning an average annual wage of $54,000. The Park has about 364,000 square feet of incubation space, making it the largest business incubator complex in the state. The Tippecanoe County unemployment rate peaked at 10.6% in July 2009 and ended at 7.4% for 2011 compared to 8.6% for Indiana and 8.5% nationally.   The housing market has remained fairly stable for the last several years with no significant price bubble and no resulting price swings. As of the most recent third quarter results provided by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the five year percent change in house prices for the Lafayette Metropolitan Statistical Area was a 0.06% decrease with the one-year change a 0.45% decrease. For the third quarter, the most recent report available, housing prices increased 2.17%. The number of houses sold in the county in 2011 was stable, down about 2% from last year. Building permits for single family residences were up substantially, from 381 in 2010 to 462 in 2011, a 21% increase.   We have seen progress in our problem loans as more borrowers who had fallen behind on their loans are qualifying for troubled debt restructures, have resumed payments or we have acquired control of their properties. The majority of our delinquent loans are secured by real estate and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover incurred losses. The challenge is to get delinquent borrowers back on a workable payment schedule or if that is not feasible, to get control of their properties through an overburdened court system. In 2011, we acquired 19 properties through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and an additional 12 properties through foreclosure. We sold 23 OREO properties in 2011.   The funds we use to make loans come primarily from deposits from customers in our market area, from brokered deposits and from Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. In addition we maintain an investment portfolio of available-for-sale securities to provide liquidity as needed. Our preference is to rely on local deposits unless the cost is not competitive, but if the need is immediate we will acquire pre-payable FHLB advances which are immediately available for member banks within their borrowing tolerance and can then be replaced with local or brokered deposits as they become available. We will also consider purchasing fixed term FHLB advances or brokered deposits as needed. We generally prefer brokered deposits over FHLB advances when the cost of raising money locally is not competitive. The deposits are available with a range of terms, there is no collateral requirement and the money is predictable as it cannot be withdrawn early except in the case of the death of a depositor and there is no option to have the money rollover at maturity. In 2011 total deposits decreased by over $3.0 million, from $311.5 million to $308.4 million. This decrease consisted of a $12.2 million decrease in our higher rate time accounts and a $9.2 million increase in our core deposits, primarily because of depositors’ preference for immediate access to their accounts if needed. Our reliance on brokered funds as a percentage of total deposits decreased slightly in 2011 from 5.45% of deposits to 5.27% with the actual dollar amount decreasing from $17.0 million to $16.2 million. While we always welcome local deposits, the cost and convenience of brokered funds make them a useful alternative. We will also continue to rely on FHLB advances to provide immediate liquidity and help manage interest rate risk.   Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our loan and investment portfolio and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income depends on the balance of our loan and investment portfolios and the size of our net interest margin – the difference between the income generated from loans and the cost of funding. Our net interest income also depends on the shape of the yield curve. The Federal Reserve has held short-term rates at almost zero for the last two years while long-term rates have fallen to the 3.0% range. Because deposits are generally tied to shorter-term market rates and loans are generally tied to      36    longer-term rates this would typically be viewed as a positive step and in fact our net interest margin has been increasing. Our expectation for 2012 is that deposits rates will remain at these low levels as the Federal Reserve continues to focus on strengthening the economy. Overall loan rates are expected to stay low or rise slightly.   Rate changes can typically be expected to have an impact on interest income. Because the Federal Reserve has stated it intends to keep rates low, we expect to see little change in the money supply or market rates in 2012. Low rates generally increase borrower preference for fixed rate products which we typically sell on the secondary market. Some existing adjustable rate loans can be expected to reprice to lower rates which could be expected to have a negative impact on our interest income, although many of our loans have already reached their interest rate floors. While we would expect to sell the majority of our fixed rate loans on the secondary market, we expect to book some higher quality loans to replace runoff in the portfolio. Although new loans put on the books in 2012 will be at comparatively low rates we expect they will provide a return above any other opportunities for investment.   Our primary expense is interest on deposits and FHLB advances which are used to fund loan growth. We offer customers in our market area time deposits for terms ranging from three months to 66 months, checking accounts and savings accounts. We also purchase brokered deposits and FHLB advances as needed to provide funding or improve our interest rate risk position. Generally when interest rates are low, depositors will choose shorter-term products and conversely when rates are high, depositors will choose longer-term products.   We consider expected changes in interest rates when structuring our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities. When rates are expected to increase we try to book shorter-term assets that will reprice relatively quickly to higher rates over time, and book longer-term liabilities that will remain for a longer time at lower rates. Conversely, when rates are expected to fall, we would like our balance sheet to be structured such that loans will reprice more slowly to lower rates and deposits will reprice more quickly. We currently offer a three-year and a five-year certificate of deposit that allows depositors one opportunity to have their rate adjusted to the market rate at a future date to encourage them to choose longer-term deposit products. However, since we are not able to predict market interest rate fluctuations, our asset/liability management strategy may not prevent interest rate changes from having an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.   Our results of operations may also be affected by general and local competitive conditions, particularly those with respect to changes in market rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.     2011 Summary   Our strategy in 2011 was to focus on improving credit quality by enhancing credit analysis, working to manage non-performing loans and dispose of other real estate owned (OREO), control the cost of funds and other expenses, and focus on growth in other income. New lending was focused on selectively extending credit to stronger borrowers to improve credit quality and on increasing our secondary market lending, including VA and FHA lending to qualified borrowers. Our credit department is fully staffed with a department manager experienced in workouts and debt restructuring, two experienced credit analysts and two collectors.   Although the local economy fared somewhat better in 2011, the opportunity for loan production was generally lower than expected despite low market interest rates. Local unit residential real estate sales in 2011 decreased slightly from 2010, from 1,667 properties to 1,627, although building permits for single family homes were up over 20%. Commercial real estate activity was more often due to existing properties changing hands or being refinanced rather than new projects being started. New building activity was primarily in the medical corridor connecting the two new hospitals, industrial growth on the south side of town, and ongoing building at Purdue University and in the Purdue Research Park. Our residential loan originators originated and sold $52.7 million of residential loans on the secondary market for a gain of $1.1 million. In 2011, we sold $1.0 million of OREO properties, consisting of 23 properties.   In 2011 we allocated $5.4 million to loan loss reserves. The largest portion of the allocation was $2.5 million of impairments on primarily commercial properties as a result of new appraisals received in the fourth quarter. We also charged off $907,000 of loans where we no longer expected payment, $887,000 to write off the loss on property sales where we agreed to let the borrower accept a price lower than the balance on their loan, $793,000 to charge down the balance on loans to be restructured and $347,000 to reduce OREO properties to market value based on new appraisals when we obtained control of the properties and transferred them into OREO. We had recoveries of $67,000 in 2011 and added $2.6 million of foreclosed properties to OREO. At December 31, 2011 our allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.74%, compared to 1.65% at December 2010. Our non-performing loans decreased from $18.1 million at December 31, 2010 to $12.1 million at December 31, 2011, including $5.3 million of loans that were less than 90 days past due but must remain as non-performing loans until they show they can continue to perform, typically by paying as agreed for six to      37    twelve months. At December 31, 2011, our allowance for loan losses compared to non-performing loans was 44.21% compared to 29.61% at December 31, 2010. Non-performing loans compared to total loans decreased from 5.59% at December 31, 2010 to 3.95% at December 31, 2011. Our OREO properties at December 31, 2011 were $1.7 million compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. In 2011 we wrote off losses of $700,000 on the sale of OREO properties generally due to the deterioration in the condition of the properties at the time of sale. We believe our allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb estimated incurred losses inherent in our loan portfolio. While we continue to seek to lower our delinquencies, based on our analysis we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover incurred losses.   The continuing upward slope of the yield curve in 2011 had the expected effect of increasing interest rate margins. While loans tied to prime remained at low rates and other repricing variable rate loans repriced to lower rates resulting in a 16 basis point decrease in the yield on loans, deposit rates also reacted to the lower rates and the average rate decreased by 40 basis points. This was due to both the decrease in deposit rates and the movement of deposits from higher rate time accounts to lower rate demand and savings accounts. The rate on FHLB advances also fell 98 basis points in 2011.   Other non-interest income, excluding the gain on sale of loans and the loss on the sale of OREO, increased by $26,000 from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011 generally due to increases in several areas including a $62,000 increase in debit card fees due to increased activity and a $42,000 increase in mortgage loan servicing fees also due to increased activity, as well as by a $54,000 gain on the sale on investment securities. These were partially offset by a $125,000 decrease in deposit account fees due primarily to changes in our fee structure due to changes mandated by Dodd-Frank.   The results of our loan and deposit activity in 2011 are illustrated in the Selected Financial Condition Data on page 33 and include:      · Residential mortgage loans (including loans held for sale) decreased by 10.5% from $125.1 million to $112.0 million.      · All other real estate loans, net, including multi-family, land, land development, construction and commercial real estate loans decreased 2.6% from $174.3 million to $170.0 million net of undisbursed loans.      · Commercial business lending decreased 12.0% from $16.3 million to $14.4 million.      · At December 31, 2011, 73.6% of our gross loan portfolio had adjustable interest rates.      · Total deposit accounts decreased 1.0% from $311.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $308.4 million at December 31, 2011, with core deposits increasing 6.3% from $146.0 million to $155.2 million over the same period.     2012 Overview   We expect to see continued slow growth in our residential loan portfolio through 2012 with interest rates generally staying at or near historically low levels. While we expect to see good volume in residential mortgage loan refinance activity, we intend to originate these loans for sale on the secondary market when borrowers choose long-term fixed rate terms, while keeping some of our shorter-term fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio. We expect to have the opportunity to consider some new commercial loans but will continue to evaluate them with an eye to credit quality. However, portfolio loan growth overall is expected to be modest.   Our operating results will continue to be affected by several factors involving the disposition of non-performing loans including the disposition of properties in foreclosure or held in other real estate owned, the level of the provision for loan losses to recognize impairments due to lower appraisal values, the loss of interest income on non-performing assets and non-interest expenses incurred in obtaining, marketing and disposing of the properties. These factors are expected to continue to have an impact in 2012 as we continue to address existing problem loans as well as any new loans encountering problems. Our allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans ended the year at 44.21% and the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.74%. We continue to work proactively with troubled borrowers while their situation is still salvageable. We monitor these and all other loans in our portfolio carefully and perform specific impairment analyses on any loans over 90 days delinquent. Based on our analysis, we believe that our current loan loss reserve is sufficient to cover estimated incurred losses.      38    We intend to continue to follow a strategy in 2012 that includes (1) maintaining a strong capital position, (2) managing our vulnerability to changes in interest rates by emphasizing adjustable rate and/or shorter-term loans, (3) optimizing our net interest margin by supplementing our traditional mortgage lending with prudent multi-family and commercial real estate, consumer and construction loans when feasible, (4) working to originate and sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market for a fee, including FHA and VA loans, to access a market not previously available to us, and (5) funding our growth by using primarily local deposits but using brokered deposits and FHLB advances should loan growth warrant it.     Possible Implications of Current Events   Significant external factors impact our results of operations including the general economic environment, changes in the level of market interest rates, government policies, actions by regulatory authorities and competition. Our cost of funds is influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for real estate loans and other types of loans, which are in turn affected by the interest rates at which such loans are made, general economic conditions affecting loan demand and the availability of funds for lending activities.   Management continues to assess the impact on the Company of the uncertain economic and regulatory environment affecting the country at large and the financial services industry in particular. The level of turmoil in the financial services industry does present unusual risks and challenges for the Company, as described below:   The Current Economic Environment Poses Challenges For Us and Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations . We are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment, including generally uncertain national conditions and local conditions in our markets. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for several years. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. Financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets. While we are taking steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans, and while our local economy has remained somewhat insulated from the most severe effects of the current economic environment, all financial institutions nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets and are affected by these events.   Our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, and construction and land development loans. Continued declines in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences: increases in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decline; deposits may decrease, which would adversely impact our liquidity position; and collateral for our loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers’ borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.   Impact of Recent and Future Legislation . Congress and the Treasury Department have adopted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system and declines in the housing market. The actual impact that measures undertaken to alleviate the credit crisis will have on the financial markets is unknown. The failure of such measures to help stabilize the financial market, and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock. Finally, there can be no assurance regarding the specific impact that such measures may have on us and no assurance whether or to what extent we will be able to benefit from such programs.   In addition to the legislation mentioned above, federal and state governments could pass additional legislation responsive to current credit conditions. As an example, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the Bank’s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits its ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible.   Also, as described in Part I, Item 1 – Regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act will cause widespread changes, already eliminating the regulatory authority of the OTS and making the OCC the primary regulator of Lafayette Savings and the Federal Reserve the primary regulator of LSB Financial as of July 21, 2011. At this time, we cannot determine the specific impact this legislation will have on the Company.      39    Adverse Effect on Our Industry from Difficult Market Conditions . Widespread downturns in the U.S. housing market may have an effect in our market area. The market turmoil and tightening of credit generally have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity. We do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to dissipate in the near future. A worsening of these conditions would likely have adverse effects on us and others in the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:      · We expect to face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.      · Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors.      · The process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.      · Competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.      · We may be required to pay even higher deposit insurance premiums because market developments continue to significantly deplete the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduce the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.   Additional Increases in Insurance Premiums. The FDIC insures the Bank’s deposits up to a maximum amount, generally $250,000 per depositor. Current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures. The FDIC takes control of failed banks and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC charges us premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at 2.0% of insured deposits. The Bank is also subject to assessment for the Financing Corporation (FICO) to service the interest on its bond obligations. The amount assessed is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds are repaid between 2017 and 2019. Future increases in deposit insurance premiums or changes in risk classification would increase the Bank’s deposit related costs.   Effective with the June 2011 reporting period, the FDIC, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, changed the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and scaled the insurance premium rates to the increased assessment base. As a result of the change to an asset-based assessment, the Company experienced a decrease in premiums.   The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Increased assessment rates and special assessments have had a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and could continue to do so.   Future Reduction in Liquidity in the Banking System. The Federal Reserve Bank has been providing vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system to compensate for weaknesses in short-term borrowing markets and other capital markets. A reduction in the Federal Reserve’s activities or capacity could reduce liquidity in the markets, thereby increasing funding costs to the Bank or reducing the availability of funds to the Bank to finance its existing operations.   Concentrations of Real Estate Loans Could Subject the Company to Increased Risks in the Event of a Real Estate Recession or Natural Disaster. A significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio is secured by real estate. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. While property values in this area have been relatively unaffected by the economic downturn, with housing values decreasing approximately 0.45% in 2011 in the Lafayette Metropolitan Statistical Area, a further weakening of the real estate market in our primary market area could result in an increase in the number of borrowers unable to refinance or who may default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Significant natural disasters can also negatively affect the value of real estate that secures our loans or interrupt our business operations, also negatively impacting our operating results or financial condition.   Credit Risk Could Adversely Affect Our Operating Results or Financial Condition. One of the greatest risks facing lenders is credit risk – that is, the risk of losing principal and interest due to a borrower’s failure to perform      40    according to the terms of a loan agreement. During the last few years, the banking industry has experienced increasing trends in problem assets and credit losses which have resulted from weakening national economic trends and a decline in housing values. While management attempts to provide an allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to cover probable incurred losses based on loan portfolio growth, past loss experience, general economic conditions, information about specific borrower situations, and other factors, future adjustments to reserves may become necessary, and net income could be significantly affected, if circumstances differ substantially from assumptions used with respect to such factors.   Interest Rate Risk Could Adversely Affect Our Operations. The Company’s earnings depend to a great extent upon the level of net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that the earnings and capital will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. While the Company attempts to adjust its asset/liability mix in order to limit the magnitude of interest rate risk, interest rate risk management is not an exact science. Rather, it involves estimates as to how changes in the general level of interest rates will impact the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities. Moreover, rate changes can vary depending upon the level of rates and competitive factors. From time to time, maturities of assets and liabilities are not balanced, and a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest margins and results of operations of the Company. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, which, because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements, generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions.     Critical Accounting Policies   Generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgments to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Management of LSB Financial must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. For a complete discussion of LSB Financial’s significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2011, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain policies are considered critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates. Changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements. Management has reviewed the application of these policies with the Audit Committee of LSB Financial’s Board of Directors. These policies include the following:   Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in Lafayette Savings’ loan portfolios. In determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses, management makes numerous assumptions, estimates and assessments.   The strategy also emphasizes diversification on an industry and customer level, regular credit quality reviews and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality.   Lafayette Savings’ allowance consists of three components: probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans, probable losses estimated from historical loss rates, and probable losses resulting from economic or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance.   Larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses and all loans that are rated substandard or lower are subject to individual review. Where appropriate, reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow and, if the loan is considered to be collateral dependent, based on the fair value of the collateral. Included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in FASB ASC 310-10 (formerly FAS 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan). Any allowances for impaired loans are determined by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral based on the discounted appraised value. Historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations.   Homogenous smaller balance loans, such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded. Reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge-offs for one year. Loss rates are based on the average net charge-off history by loan category.   Historical loss rates for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management’s judgment, reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition. Factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies, trends in the nature and volume of loans (delinquencies, charge-offs and non-accrual loans), changes in mix, asset quality trends, risk management and loan      41    administration, changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards, collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the Bank’s internal loan review.   Allowances on individual loans are reviewed quarterly and historical loss rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience.   Lafayette Savings’ primary market area for lending is Tippecanoe County, Indiana and to a lesser extent the eight surrounding counties. When evaluating the adequacy of allowance, consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect of changing economic conditions on Lafayette Savings’ customers.   Mortgage Servicing Rights . Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) associated with loans originated and sold, where servicing is retained, are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio. Critical accounting policies for MSRs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests. The methodology used to determine the valuation of MSRs requires the development and use of a number of estimates, including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance. Events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates, mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans. The carrying value of the MSRs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing rights are compared to a valuation prepared based on a discounted cash flow methodology, utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Impairment, if any, is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets.   Accounting for Foreclosed Assets . Assets acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations and changes in the valuation allowance are included in net income or expense from foreclosed assets.      42    Financial Condition at December 31, 2011 compared to Financial Condition at December 31, 2010 SELECTED FINANCIAL CONDITION DATA   (Dollars in Thousands)                                   December 31,     December 31,     $       %        2011     2010     Difference     Difference                                Total assets   $ 364,290     $ 371,847     $ (7,557 )     (2.03 )%                                    Loans receivable, including loans held for sale, net     305,630       323,075       (17,445 )     (5.40 ) 1-4 family residential mortgage loans     111,987       125,121       (13,134 )     (10.50 ) Home equity lines of credit     17,330       17,043       287       1.68   Other real estate loans net undisbursed portion of loans     169,855       174,320       (4,465 )     (2.56 ) Commercial business loans     14,366       16,332       (1,966 )     (12.04 ) Consumer loans     1,162       1,208       (46 )     (3.81 ) Loans sold     52,700       49,389       3,311       6.70                                      Non-performing loans     6,764       12,439       (5,675 )     (45.62 ) Loans past due 90 days, still accruing     --       676       (676 )     (100.00 ) Loans less than 90 days past due, not accruing     5,295       4,931       364       7.38   Other real estate owned     1,746       1,214       532       43.82   Non-performing assets     13,805       19,260       (5,455 )     (28.32 )                                    Available-for-sale securities     13,845       11,805       2,040       17.28   Short-term investments     3,156       2,980       176       5.91                                      Deposits     308,433       311,458       (3,025 )     (0.97 ) Core deposits     155,223       146,007       9,216       6.31   Time accounts     153,154       165,451       (12,297 )     (7.43 ) Brokered deposits     16,244       16,984       (740 )     (4.36 )                                    FHLB advances     18,000       22,500       (4,500 )     (20.00 ) Shareholders’ equity (net)     36,174       35,577       597       1.68     As shown in the table above, the net balance in our loan portfolio decreased by $17.4 million from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. Loans decreased primarily due to a $13.1 million decrease in residential loans largely the result of borrowers taking advantage of low market interest rates and refinancing to primarily fixed rate loans which we typically sell on the secondary market. We sold $52.7 million of residential loans in 2011 compared to $49.4 million in 2010. These loans were sold based on asset/liability considerations and to increase income from the gain on sale of loans. There was also a $4.2 million decrease in home equity and other real estate loans due primarily to the low volume of new loan activity combined with the paydown or chargeoff of existing loans.   The $2.0 million increase in our available-for-sale securities was primarily due to a desire to get a return on investments in light of slow loan demand and to have investments available to use for liquidity purposes. The balance in short term investments remained relatively constant. Due to low returns on these investments we try to keep the balances at the minimal amount needed to meet cash flow needs.   Deposit balances decreased by $3.0 million. Because we have minimal loan demand we are not aggressively working to generate deposits, however, we have worked to attract depositors to our core deposit accounts rather than into higher rate time deposits. Part of our success in this endeavor is because of a desire on the part of depositors not to lock up their funds for longer periods in uncertain times. In 2011 we reduced time deposits by $12.3 million and increased core deposits by $9.2 million. We are generally letting brokered funds roll off as they mature.        43    We utilize advances available through the FHLB as needed to provide additional funding for loan growth as well as for asset/liability management purposes. At December 31, 2011, we had $18.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding compared to $22.5 million at December 31, 2010. Based on the collateral we currently have listed under a blanket collateral arrangement with the FHLB, we could borrow up to $55.8 million in additional advances. We have other collateral available if needed. These advances are generally available on the same day as requested and allow us the flexibility of keeping our daily cash levels tighter than might otherwise be prudent.   Non-performing assets, which include non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days past due and foreclosed assets, decreased from $19.3 million at December 31, 2010 to $13.8 million at December 31, 2011. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2011 consisted of $5.6 million of loans on residential real estate, $5.7 million on land or commercial real estate loans, $716,000 on commercial business loans and $44,000 on consumer loans. Foreclosed assets consisted of $1.3 million of residential properties and $495,000 of commercial real estate. At December 31, 2011, our allowance for loan losses equaled 1.74% of total loans compared to 1.65% at December 31, 2010. The allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 totaled 38.62% of non-performing assets compared to 27.67% at December 31, 2010, and 44.21% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2011 compared to 29.61% at December 31, 2010. Our non-performing assets equaled 3.80% of total assets at December 31, 2011 compared to 5.18% at December 31, 2010. Part of this decrease is due to $4.7 million of loans being charged down or charged off by the bank, $3.3 million from loans paid off or paid down by borrowers and $678,000 from upgraded loans that are performing as agreed. These were offset by $5.0 million of loans added to non-accrual loans during the year.   When a non-performing loan is added to our classified loan list, an impairment analysis is completed to determine expected losses upon final disposition of the property. An adjustment to loan loss reserves is made at that time for any anticipated losses. This analysis is reviewed and updated quarterly thereafter. It may take several months or up to two years to move a foreclosed property through the system to the point where we can obtain title to and dispose of it. We attempt to acquire properties through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure if there are no other liens on the properties. In 2011, we acquired 19 properties through deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure and an additional 12 properties through foreclosure. In 2010, we acquired 8 properties, all through foreclosure. $347,000 was charged against loan loss reserves for these properties in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the property to the estimated realizable value. Although we believe we use the best information available to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances and/or economic conditions cause substantial changes in the estimates we use in making the determinations about the levels of the allowance for losses. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These agencies may require the recognition of additions to the allowance based upon their judgments of information available at the time of their examination.   Shareholders’ equity increased $597,000, or 1.68%, during 2011 primarily as a result of net income of $539,000. Shareholders’ equity to total assets was 9.93% at December 31, 2011 compared to 9.57% at December 31, 2010.     Results of Operations   Our results of operations depend primarily on the levels of net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also dependent upon the level of our non-interest income, including fee income and service charges, gains or losses on the sale of loans and the level of our non-interest expenses, including general and administrative expenses. Net interest income is dependent upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and upon the interest rate which is earned or paid on these items. Our results of operations are also affected by the level of the provision for loan losses. We, like other financial institutions, are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different times, or on a different basis, than our interest-earning assets.      44    Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields   The following table presents for the periods indicated the total dollar amount of interest income earned on average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields on such assets, as well as the interest expense paid on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the rates paid on such liabilities.

The change in total interest income and total interest expense is allocated between those related to changes in the outstanding balances and those due to changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume ( i.e ., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate ( i.e. , changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and change due to rate.        Year Ended December 31,        2011 vs. 2010     2010 vs. 2009        Increase (Decrease) Due to     Total   Increase ( Decrease)     Increase (Decrease) Due to     Total Increase ( Decrease)        Volume     Rate           Volume     Rate              (In thousands)                                          Interest-earning assets:                                     Loans receivable   $ (764 )   $ (503 )   $ (1,267 )   $ 280     $ (985 )   $ (705 ) Mortgage-backed securities     (11 )     (12 )     (23 )     (23 )     (25 )     (48 ) Other investments     16       (40 )     (24 )     (157 )     138       (19 ) FHLB stock     (12 )     25       13       (1 )     9       8   Total interest-earning assets   $ (771 )   $ (530 )   $ (1,301 )   $ 99     $ (863 )   $ (764 )                                                    Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                 Savings deposits   $ ---     $ (70 )   $ (70 )   $ 1     $ (135 )   $ (134 ) Demand deposits and NOW accounts     98       (132 )     (34 )     234       (92 )     142   Time deposits     (358 )     (739 )     (1,097 )     (49 )     (1,671 )     (1,720 ) Borrowings     (438 )     (287 )     (725 )     (1,076 )     (432 )     (1,508 ) Total interest-bearing liabilities   $ (698 )   $ (1,228 )   $ (1,926 )   $ (890 )   $ (2,330 )   $ (3,220 )                                                    Net interest income                   $ 625                     $ 2,456     Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.   General. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $539,000, a decrease of $1.6 million or 74.54%, from net income of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The primary reason for the decrease was a $2.6 million increase in the provision for loan losses, as well as a $327,000 increase in non-interest expenses and a $172,000 decrease in non-interest income. These decreases were partially offset by a $625,000 increase in net interest income and an $898,000 decrease in taxes on income.   Our return on average assets was 0.15% for the year ended 2011, compared to 0.56% for the year ended 2010. Return on average equity was 1.48% for the year ended 2011 compared to 6.09% for 2010. We paid no cash dividends on common stock during 2011 compared to quarterly cash dividends on common stock in the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010 totaling $389,000, or $0.25 per share, for the year, representing a dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share divided by diluted net income per share) of approximately 18.4%.   Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $625,000 over the same period in 2010. Our net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest-earnings assets) increased from 3.68% at December 31, 2010 to 4.02% at December 31, 2011. The largest factor in the increase in net interest income was the decrease in the average rate on deposits and FHLB advances from 1.79% in 2010 to 1.29% in 2011 caused primarily by extreme reductions in short-term interest rates due to cuts by the Federal Reserve. Separating deposits from FHLB advances, the rate on deposits decreased from 1.62% in 2010 to 1.22% in 2011 while the rate on advances decreased from 3.26% in 2010 to 2.28% in 2011. There was a smaller decrease in the average rate on interest-earning assets, and particularly loans, with the average rate on interest-earning assets decreasing only 16 basis points from 5.44% in 2010 to 5.28% in 2011. The balance of average interest-earning      46    assets also decreased over the period from $347.3 million in 2010 to $333.3 million in 2011. Overall, the average rate on loans and investments decreased by 16 basis points while the average rate paid on advances and deposits decreased by 50 basis points.   Interest income on loans decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily because of lower average loan volume as well as lower interest rates. The average yield on loans decreased from 5.62% for the year ended December 31, 2010 to 5.46% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The average balance of loans held in our portfolio decreased by $13.8 million from $327.4 million in 2010 to $313.6 million in 2011.   Interest income on investments decreased $34,000 taking into account an increase of $13,000 in dividends on FHLB stock for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in interest on investments and FHLB stock created a 15 basis point decrease in the average rates on investments to 2.33% in 2011 from 2.48% in 2010 primarily due to the decrease in market rates. The average balance of investments changed only slightly from $19.9 million in 2010 to $19.7 million in 2011.   Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased $1.9 million over the same period in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities consisting of deposit accounts and FHLB advances from 1.79% in 2010 to 1.29% in 2011 while the average rate on FHLB advances fell from 3.26% to 2.28%. Average balances of deposits increased slightly from $305.8 million in 2010 to $306.4 million in 2011 while repayment of FHLB advances in 2011 reduced their average balance from $35.7 million in 2010 to $19.3 million in 2011.   Provision for Loan Losses . The evaluation of the level of loan loss reserves is an ongoing process that includes closely monitoring loan delinquencies.

Loans 90 days past due but not yet three payments past due will continue to accrue interest as long as it has been determined that the loan is well secured and the borrower has the capacity to repay.   Troubled debt restructurings and loans that begin to perform after a period of nonperformance are considered non-accruing loans until sufficient time has passed for them to establish a pattern of compliance with the terms of the restructure. There were $5.3 million of loans at December 31, 2011 considered non-accruing in the chart above that are troubled debt restructurings or loans that have begun to perform after a period of nonperformance compared to $4.9 million at December 31, 2010.   We establish our provision for loan losses based on a systematic analysis of risk factors in the loan portfolio. The analysis includes consideration of concentrations of credit, past loss experience, current economic conditions, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio, estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, delinquencies and other relevant factors. From time to time, we also use the services of a consultant to assist in the evaluation of our commercial real estate loan portfolio.   On at least a quarterly basis, a formal analysis of the adequacy of the allowance is prepared and reviewed by management and the Board of Directors. This analysis serves as a point-in-time assessment of the level of the allowance and serves as a basis for provision for loan losses.      47    More specifically, our analysis of the loan portfolio will begin at the time the loan is originated, at which time each loan is assigned a risk rating. If the loan is a commercial credit, the borrower will also be assigned a similar rating. Loans that continue to perform as agreed will be included in one of ten non-classified loan categories. Portions of the allowance are allocated to loan portfolios in the various risk grades, based upon a variety of factors, including historical loss experience, trends in the type and volume of the loan portfolios, trends in delinquent and non-performing loans, and economic trends affecting our market. Loans no longer performing as agreed are assigned a higher risk rating, eventually resulting in their being regarded as classified loans. A collateral reevaluation is completed on all classified loans. This process results in the allocation of specific amounts of the allowance to individual problem loans, generally based on an analysis of the collateral securing those loans. These components are added together and compared to the balance of our allowance at the evaluation date.   At December 31, 2011 our largest areas of concern were loans on non-residential properties and, to a lesser extent one- to four-family non-owner-occupied rental properties and loans on land and land development. Loans delinquent more than 30 days at December 31, 2011 included $2.1 million of loans on non-residential properties, $2.4 million of loans on one- to four-family rental properties and $1.2 million of loans on land. While there were also $2.1 million of delinquent commercial non-real estate loans, over $1.5 million of these loans were scheduled to be repaid early in 2012 and that has occurred. There has been some improvement in the local economy and we are seeing some improvement in our non-residential loan portfolio. There are still problems with vacancies and delinquent rents in the one- to four-family rental properties, especially in non-campus housing, and we are working to decrease our concentrations in that sector.   We recorded a $5.4 million provision for loan losses during 2011 as a result of our analyses of our current loan portfolios, compared to $2.8 million during 2010. We added $2.6 million or 49.0% of the provision in the fourth quarter, primarily in response to lower than expected property values on newly impaired loans or where appraisals older than one year were updated. The provisions were necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb losses inherent and incurred in the loan portfolio. During the year 2011, we charged $5.4 million against loan loss reserves on 74 loans either written off, written down to fair value or taken into other real estate owned. We expect to obtain possession of more properties in 2012 that are currently in the process of foreclosure. The final disposition of these properties may be expected to result in a loss in some cases. The $5.4 million reserve for loan losses in 2011 was considered adequate to cover further charge-offs based on our evaluation and our loan mix.   Our loan portfolio does not contain option ARM products, interest only loans, or loans with initial teaser rates. While we occasionally make loans to borrowers with credit scores in the subprime range, these loans are only made if there are sufficient mitigating factors, not as part of a subprime mortgage plan. We occasionally make mortgages that exceed high loan-to-value regulatory guidelines for property type. We currently have $8.4 million of mortgage loans that are not one- to four-family loans that qualify as high loan-to-value. We typically make these loans only to well-qualified borrowers and none of these loans are delinquent. We also have $7.1 million of one- to four-family loans which either alone or combined with a second mortgage exceed high loan-to-value guidelines. Of these loans, $306,000 are currently over 30 days past due. Our total high loan-to-value loans at December 31, 2011 were at 40% of capital, well under regulatory guidelines of 100% of capital. We have $17.3 million of home equity lines of credit of which five loans totaling $121,000 are delinquent more than 30 days.   At December 31, 2011, non-performing assets, consisting of non-performing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent, loans less than 90 days past due still on nonaccrual, and other real estate owned, totaled $13.8 million compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2010. In addition to our non-performing assets, we identified $6.7 million in other loans of concern where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans as non-performing assets in the future. The vast majority of these loans, as well as our non-performing assets, are well collateralized.   At December 31, 2011, we believe that our allowance for loan losses was adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Our allowance for losses equaled 1.74% of net loans receivable and 44.21% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2011, compared to 1.65% and 29.61% at December 31, 2010, respectively. Our non-performing assets equaled 3.79% of total assets at December 31, 2011 compared to 5.18% at December 31, 2010. We typically sustain losses averaging about 30% of the total principal balance on non-performing loans that progress to foreclosure and are then sold as OREO properties. At December 31, 2011 our reserve for loan losses exceeded this amount by over $1.2 million.      48    Non-Interest Income . Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $172,000, or 5.58%, compared to the same period in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to a $259,000 increase in the loss recognized on the sale of OREO properties and by a $125,000 decrease in deposit account service charges. These decreases were partially offset by a $61,000 increase in the gain on sale of loans due to the increase in the volume of loans sold from $49.4 million in 2010 to $52.7 million in 2011, a $54,000 increase in the gain on sale of securities due to a restructure of our portfolio to acquire some longer term investments, and a $97,000 increase in other non-interest income due primarily to a $63,000 increase in debit card fees due to increased activity and a $42,000 increase in mortgage loan servicing fees also due to increased activity.   Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $327,000 over the same period in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $270,000 increase in Other Expenses including a $99,000 increase in the costs related to acquiring, maintaining and disposing of foreclosed and OREO properties because of the increase in the number of these properties, a $91,000 increase in expenses related to compliance and reporting costs, and a $95,000 increase in loan processing costs for which we expect partial reimbursement where these payments were made on behalf of borrowers and will be included in their loan closing costs. These increases were offset by a $123,000 decrease in FDIC insurance due to lower premium assessments. The other major increase in expenses was a $177,000 increase in salaries and benefits due primarily to a $160,000 increase in health insurance costs and a $50,000 increase in salaries due primarily to continuing loan origination activity by commission-based loan originators and a $149,000 decrease in occupancy costs due primarily to lower real estate and personal property taxes due to lower assessed values.   Income Tax Expense. Our income tax provision decreased by $898,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to decreased income.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our primary sources of funds are deposits, repayment and prepayment of loans, interest earned on or maturation of investment securities and short-term investments, borrowings and funds provided from operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans, investments and mortgage-backed securities are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general market interest rates, economic conditions and competition.   We monitor our cash flow carefully and strive to minimize the level of cash held in low-rate overnight accounts or in cash on hand. We also carefully track the scheduled delivery of loans committed for sale to be added to our cash flow calculations.   Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Bank originated loans totaling $94.4 million and purchased $1.3 million of mortgage-backed securities. These activities were funded primarily by principal repayments and prepayments on loans and maturities of mortgage-backed securities totaling $59.5 million.   The proceeds from the sale of loans totaled $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Bank also purchased $5.2 million of investment securities funded primarily through sales and maturities of investment securities of $4.5 million. There were no sales of investment securities in 2010.   Because there was a decrease in the balance of loans in our portfolio in 2011, we were less aggressive in acquiring additional deposits resulting in a $3.0 million decrease in our deposits. We also allowed $4.5 million of FHLB advances to roll off in 2011. As opportunities for loan growth improve, we intend to use FHLB advances as a source of funding for loans when advantageous interest-rate risk matches can be found.   Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function for our senior management. We adjust our investment strategy, within the limits established by the investment policy, based upon assessments of expected loan demand, expected cash flows, FHLB advance opportunities, market yields and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Base levels of liquidity have generally been invested in interest-earning overnight and time deposits with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and more recently at the Federal Reserve since it has started to pay interest on deposits in excess of reserve requirements and because of increasing wire transfer requests due to a change in funding methods now required by title companies. Funds for which a demand is not foreseen in the near future are invested in investment and other securities for the purpose of yield enhancement and asset/liability management.      49    Our current internal policy for liquidity is 5% of total assets. Our liquidity ratio at December 31, 2011 was 8.61% as a percentage of total assets.   We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet current funding commitments. At December 31, 2011 we had outstanding commitments to originate loans and available lines of credit totaling $30.0 million and commitments to provide borrowers the funds needed to complete current construction projects in the amount of $3.2 million. Certificates of deposit that will mature in one year or less at December 31, 2011 totaled $80.9 million. Based on our experience, our certificates of deposit have been a relatively stable source of long-term funds as such certificates are generally renewed upon maturity since we have established long-term banking relationships with our customers. Therefore, we believe a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although that cannot be assured. An exception to this rule would be the brokered certificates of deposit. Of the certificates maturing in one year or less at December 31, 2011, $2.6 million were brokered deposits which will be leaving the Bank at maturity. However, there is no reason to expect that replacement funds would not be available in the brokered market.   LSB Financial also has a need for, and sources of, liquidity. Liquidity is required to fund our operating expenses and fund stock repurchase programs, as well as for the payment of dividends to shareholders as needed. At December 31, 2011, LSB Financial had $225,000 in liquid assets on hand.   Federal insured savings institutions are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. If the requirement is not met, regulatory authorities may take legal or administrative actions, including restrictions on growth or operations or, in extreme cases, seizure. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, Lafayette Savings was categorized as well capitalized. Our actual and required capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 are presented in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Regulatory Matters”) in this Annual Report on 10-K.   Effective August 31, 2010, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with the OTS, requiring the Company to submit to the OTS by October 31, 2010 a capital plan for enhancing the consolidated capital of the Company for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012. In its submitted capital plan, the Company proposes to maintain risk-based capital ratios above twelve percent (200 basis points above the ten percent well-capitalized level), and core capital above eight percent (300 basis points above the five percent well-capitalized level). The current capital levels shown in Note 11 are at least 1% above these levels. The OTS notified the Company that certain revisions to the capital plan primarily relating to consolidated capital ratios and consolidated financial statements of the Company must be submitted by August 30, 2011. The Company requested clarification from the Federal Reserve regarding the requested information and submitted a response on August 30, 2011 explaining a labeling correction that the Company believes will address the concerns noted by the OTS.   The Bank’s Supervisory Agreement and the MOU require prior OCC and Federal Reserve approval of dividends by the Bank or the Company, respectively. In addition, the MOU requires prior approval by the Federal Reserve of any debt at the holding company level not in the ordinary course (including loans, cumulative preferred stock and subordinated debt), unless such debt is contemplated by the capital plan. LSB Financial does not now hold any such debt. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bank is being supervised by the OCC and the Company is being supervised by the Federal Reserve from and after July 21, 2011. Despite the fact that LSB Financial believes it could obtain regulatory approval of dividends from the Bank to LSB Financial, the Bank has elected not to declare dividends at this time because of the uncertainty regarding increased capital requirements anticipated under the Dodd-Frank Act or to be required by its new regulator.     Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements   As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. The term “off-balance-sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement, or other contractual arrangement to which any entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party and under which the Company has (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.   See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding off-balance-sheet commitments.      50    Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices   The Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.   The Company’s primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.   The principal effect of inflation, as distinct from levels of interest rates, on earnings is in the area of non-interest expense. Such expense items as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that the Company has made. The Company is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.     Quarterly Results of Operations   Q uarter Ending   Interest Income     Interest Expense     Net Interest Income     Provision For Loan Losses     Net Income     Basic Earnings Per Share     Diluted Earnings Per Share   (Dollars in Thousands, except share data)   2011   March   $ 4,475     $ 1,111     $ 3,364     $ 1,176     $ 205     $ 0.13     $ 0.13   June     4,358       1,046       3,312       675       477       0.31       0.31   September     4,399       1,041       3,358       885       457       0.29       0.29   December     4,362       991       3,371       2,625       (600 )     (0.39 )     (0.39 )      $ 17,594     $ 4,189     $ 13,405     $ 5,361     $ 539                                                                              2010                                                         March   $ 4,671     $ 1,723     $ 2,948     $ 434     $ 532     $ 0.34     $ 0.34   June     4,721       1,572       3,149       465       457       0.29       0.29   September     4,877       1,489       3,388       910       526       0.34       0.34   December     4,626       1,331       3,295       950       602       0.39       0.39        $ 18,895     $ 6,115     $ 12,780     $ 2,759     $ 2,117                       Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Not Applicable.      51      		</c>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Results of Operations   General   The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company’s business operations are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions.   Overview   PASSUR Aerospace, Inc. is a business intelligence company which develops predictive analytics built on proprietary algorithms and on concurrent integration and simultaneous mining of multiple databases. The Company believes it is positioned to provide the industry standard in business intelligence and predictive analytics for both commercial and government applications.   The Company’s revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and solutions information as well as software products; (2) professional services; and (3) annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR® Radar Systems.   The Company’s major achievements during fiscal year 2011 are summarized below. The Company:       1.     Renewed a major contract with the FAA for a program to provide access to PASSUR®’s aviation security-related products in support of the FAA’s joint role with the TSA.     2.     Launched PASSUR® Integrated Traffic Management (PITM) – a suite of integrated decision-support capabilities that target expensive, disruptive constraints in the National Air Space (NAS) through data, predictive analytics, common operating/ collaborative platforms, and detailed performance analysis. PITM allows airlines and airports to increase the efficiency, predictability, safety, and cost effectiveness of their surface operations.     3.     Developed and launched the Company’s Surface Management Program, which is an independent, worldwide, gate-to-gate network of flight tracking and airspace information. This solution is used to address congestion on the ground and in the air and to reduce fuel burn and delays. Page 13             4.     Announced a teaming agreement with ARINC to develop and deliver predictive analytics and decision support solutions -directly to the flight deck. This solution provides for greater efficiency, communication, and collaboration with the flight crew, while increasing the critical role of Dispatch.     5.     Entered into a teaming agreement with Mosaic ATM to bring to market additional products, solutions, and services for departure metering, networked surface management, and integrated traffic management.     6.     Collaborated with MIT on a ground-breaking study of surface departure metering at JFK International Airport showing the following significant benefits (annualized from seven months of data studied): $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 in reduced fuel costs, 48,000 fewer metric tons of carbon released into the atmosphere, 14,800 fewer hours of taxi time, and 5,000,000 gallons of fuel saved.     7.     Expanded the PASSUR® National Airport Network of Field Condition Reporting by over 40%. The program consolidates field condition reporting for all participating airports onto a single screen, adds new levels of automation, and is available to, and accessed by airline system operation centers in the U.S. and internationally.     8.     Launched the National Airport Information Network, addressing the industry’s needs for more effective, coordinated, and collaborative response to diversions and tarmac delays by consolidating PASSUR®’s tarmac delay, diversion management, and field condition capabilities onto a single, national industry platform.     9.     Expanded the reach and deployment of the PASSUR® Landing Fee Management program, the industry’s leading platform for the collaborative management of landing fees among airports and airlines, using independent, standardized, and automated processes.     10.     Increased the Company’s intellectual property portfolio by being awarded five new patents from November 1, 2010 to January 4, 2012. During that same period, the Company filed for an additional seven patents, all relating to improved business intelligence or predictive analytics. The Company currently owns twelve issued patents, and has an additional twenty patents which are pending with the United States Patent Office.   The Company’s business plan is to continue to focus on increasing subscription-based revenues from its suite of software applications, and to develop new applications and professional services designed to address the needs of the aviation industry and the U.S. government. The Company’s strategy is to help solve problems faced by its customers and is built on the following basic objectives: (1) continue extending the reach of the PASSUR® Network, which provides the proprietary backbone for many of its solutions; (2) continue integrating multiple additional industry data sets into its integrated aviation database, including data from a variety of additional aircraft, airspace, and ground surveillance technologies, in order to ensure that PASSUR® is the primary choice for data integration and management for large aviation organizations; (3) continue developing decision support solutions built on business intelligence, predictive analytics, and web-dashboard technology; and (4) continue developing the Company’s professional service capabilities, in order to ensure that its solutions can be fully implemented in the customer’s work environment, with minimal demand on the customer’s internal resources.   The Company shipped one and installed ten Company-owned PASSUR® Systems during fiscal year 2011 (installations include systems shipped in the current and previous fiscal year). The shipped and installed PASSUR® Systems are capitalized as part of the Company-owned PASSUR® Network. The Company will continue to expand the PASSUR® Network by shipping and installing additional PASSUR® Systems throughout fiscal year 2012. Management anticipates that future PASSUR® sites will provide increased coverage for the PASSUR® Network by increasing the Company’s ability to contract with new customers at such locations, and by providing existing customers with additional data solutions. The Company will continue to market the business intelligence, predictive analytics, as well as decision support applications and solutions derived from the PASSUR® Network, directly to the aviation industry and organizations that serve, or are served by, the aviation industry. There were one hundred and fifty-five Company-owned PASSUR® Systems located at airports worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2011. Redundant PASSUR® Systems have been installed at major customer locations.   Revenues   Management concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence, predictive analytics, and decision support product applications, utilizing data primarily derived from the PASSUR® Network. Such efforts include the continued development of new products, professional services, and existing product enhancements. Page 14       Revenues increased by $2,650,000, or 24%, to $13,609,000 in fiscal year 2011 from $10,958,000 in fiscal year 2010. New customer subscriptions and existing customer upgrades to the Company’s suite of software applications and new customer engagements for professional services accounted for 95% and 5% of this increase, respectively. The Company continues to develop and deploy new software applications and solutions, as well as a wide selection of products which address customers’ needs, easily delivered through web-based applications, as well as other new products which include stand-alone professional services.   Cost of Revenues   Costs associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor, depreciation of PASSUR® Network Systems, amortization of capitalized software development costs, communication costs, data feeds, allocated overhead costs, travel and entertainment, and consulting fees. Also included in cost of revenues are costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR® Network Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications, as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR® Network Systems. Additionally, cost of revenues in each reporting period is impacted by: (1) the number of PASSUR® Network units added to the Network, which include the production, shipment, and installation of these assets, which are capitalized to the PASSUR® Network; and (2) capitalized costs associated with software development projects. Both of these are referred to as “Capitalized Assets”, and are depreciated and/or amortized over their respective useful lives and charged to cost of revenues.   Cost of revenues increased by $1,091,000, or 23%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to increases in payroll and related costs of $561,000, depreciation and amortization of $285,000, as well as an increase in communication costs. When the Company ships and installs its PASSUR® Network Systems, there is a reduction in cost of revenues due to the fact that the labor related costs for these systems are capitalized, rather than expensed, as a component of costs of revenue. Fewer systems were shipped and installed in fiscal year 2011, as compared to fiscal year 2010, which resulted in an $814,000 increase in cost of revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase in cost of revenues was partially offset by an increase of $747,000 in the capitalization of software development costs as compared to fiscal year 2010, due primarily to the Company’s increased investment in software development projects in the current fiscal year.   Research and Development   Research and development expenses increased by $113,000, or 39%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily due to the Company’s investment in research and development in a substantial software product. These increases consisted primarily of payroll and related costs. The Company’s research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development, as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company's existing hardware, software, and information products.   The Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in research and development to develop, maintain, and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years 2011 or 2010. Research and development expenses are funded by current operations.   Selling, General, and Administrative   Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $914,000, or 21%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs.   Income from Operations    Revenues increased by $2,650,000, or 24%, to $13,609,000, total costs and expenses increased by $2,119,000, or 22%, to $11,635,000, and income from operations increased by $531,000, or 37%, to $1,974,000 in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. Page 15       Interest Expense – Related Party   Interest expense – related party decreased by $463,000, or 34%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 due to the fact that on May 9, 2011, the Company entered into a transaction that reduced its outstanding notes payable to G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company’s significant shareholder and Chairman, by $10,000,000, as a result of the transaction described in “Private Placement” below.   On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued, as a result of the transaction described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below.   Income Taxes    The Company’s provision for income taxes in each year consists of current state and local minimum taxes.   At October 31, 2011, the Company had available a federal net operating loss carry-forward of $12,014,000 for income tax purposes, which will expire in various tax years from 2012 through 2029. The Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required each reporting period. A valuation allowance is established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. During 2011 the Company reversed $1,590,000 of a total valuation allowance of $3,896,000 related to deferred tax assets, since it was determined that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. This determination was primarily based on cumulative positive earnings in recent years and projected taxable income in the future. In evaluating whether or not to realize a deferred tax asset, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results and a forecast of future taxable income.   Net Income   The Company had net income of $2,634,000, or $.39 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to net income of $21,000, or $.00 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2010.   Impact of Inflation   In the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the Company including selling prices, capital expenditures, and operating expenses.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $417,000 at October 31, 2011. The note payable to a related party was $4,815,000 at October 31, 2011, with a maturity of November 1, 2014. The Company’s stockholders’ equity was $7,165,000 at October 31, 2011. The Company had net income of $2,634,000 for fiscal year 2011.   Management is addressing the Company’s working capital deficiency by aggressively marketing the Company’s PASSUR® Network Systems information capabilities in its existing product and professional service lines, as well as in new products and professional services, which are continually being developed and deployed. Management believes that expanding its existing suite of software products and professional services, which address the wide array of needs of the aviation industry, through the continued development of new product and service offerings, will continue to lead to increased growth in the Company’s customer-base and subscription-based revenues. Additionally, if the Company’s business plan does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the Company’s operating cash requirements, the Company will attempt to obtain external financing, and if such external financing is not obtained, the Company has received an unconditional and irrevocable commitment from its significant shareholder and Chairman to receive the necessary continuing financial support to meet such obligations through January 4, 2013. Page 16       Effective November 1, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement, renewing and extending the term of the $13,815,000 notes payable due to G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company’s significant shareholder and Chairman, from one year to three years with a maturity of November 1, 2011. Under the agreement, beginning February 1, 2009 and effective through October 31, 2011, the interest rate was increased from 4.5% to 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6%, was payable in cash, and the remaining interest, at the annual rate of 3%, was payable at the option of the Company in cash or “paid in kind” and added to the principal of the notes payable. Annual interest payments were due at October 31 of each fiscal year. During October 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the due date of the interest payment owed to Mr. Gilbert on October 31, 2009 to December 31, 2009. This interest payment was paid in full by the Company prior to the extended due date. During fiscal year 2009, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $100,000, bringing the principal amount of the notes payable due to Mr. Gilbert to $13,915,000 on October 31, 2009.   In fiscal year 2010, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $1,150,000, which was used in part to fund the prior fiscal year’s interest payment, thereby increasing the principal balance of the notes payable to $15,065,000. During fiscal year 2010, the Company paid fiscal year 2010 interest to Mr. Gilbert of $914,000, representing the entire cash portion of the fiscal year 2010 interest due, thereby meeting the cash payment requirements of the loan agreement. Total cash payments for interest made to Mr. Gilbert in fiscal year 2010 were $2,037,000, including the remaining fiscal year 2009 interest payment. The balance of the fiscal year 2010 interest payable of $446,000 was accrued. In October 2010, the Company made a $250,000 principal payment, reducing the loan principal to $14,815,000, resulting in a total of $15,261,000 due to Mr. Gilbert on October 31, 2010.   On May 9, 2011, as a result of the transactions described in “Private Placement” below, the Company’s outstanding notes payable to Mr. Gilbert were reduced by $10,000,000, and a new note payable was issued to Mr. Gilbert in the amount of $4,815,000. The new note payable bears a maturity date of November 1, 2014 and an annual interest rate of 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6% will be payable in cash, and the remaining interest of 3% per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or "paid in kind" and added to the principal of the note payable. Interest payments are to be made annually on October 31 of each year. On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued.   During fiscal year 2011, the Company paid fiscal year 2011 interest to Mr. Gilbert of $912,000, representing the entire fiscal year 2011 interest due, thereby meeting the payment requirements of the loan agreement. Total payments for interest made to Mr. Gilbert in fiscal year 2011 were $1,358,000, including the remaining fiscal year 2010 interest payment.   The Company has received a commitment from Mr. Gilbert, dated January 4, 2012, that if the Company, at any time, is unable to meet its obligations through January 4, 2013, Mr. Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations. Such commitment for financial support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company, in addition to the deferral of principal and/or interest payments due on the existing loans, if deemed necessary. The note payable is secured by the Company’s assets.   The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet operating and investment requirements through October 31, 2012. During such period the Company does not anticipate borrowing additional funds from Mr. Gilbert, although it has received a commitment from Mr. Gilbert to do so if the Company requires additional funds.   Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,982,000 for fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $894,000 non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization of $2,155,000 and stock-based compensation expense, offset by a deferred tax allowance reversal of $1,590,000, as well as $2,634,000 of net income and a decrease in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of customer invoicing. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of $446,000 of accrued interest – related party, as well as decreases in deferred revenue, and accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of vendor invoice payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,657,000 for fiscal year 2011, expended primarily for capitalized software development costs. Net cash used in financing activities was $133,000 for fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $4,250,000 repayments of notes payable – related party and $170,000 private placement expenditures, offset by $4,250,000 proceeds from stock issuance and $37,000 proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Page 17       The Company’s revenue has increased as a result of its subscription-based revenue model. The Company is actively addressing the increasing costs associated with supporting the business, and plans to identify and reduce any unnecessary costs as part of its cost reduction initiatives. Additionally, the aviation market has been impacted by budgetary constraints, airline bankruptcies and consolidations due to the downturn in the current economy, the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the continued war on terrorism, and changes in fuel costs. The aviation market is extensively regulated by government agencies, particularly the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, and management anticipates that new regulations relating to air travel may continue to be issued. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are derived from airports, airlines, and organizations that serve, or are served by, the aviation industry. Any new regulations or changes in the economic situation of the aviation industry could have an impact on the future operations of the Company, either positively or negatively.   Interest by potential customers in the information and decision support software products obtained from PASSUR® Network Systems and its professional services remains strong. As a result, the Company anticipates an increase in future revenues. However, the Company cannot predict if such revenues will materialize. If sales do not increase, losses may occur. The extent of such profits or losses will be dependent on sales volume achieved and Company cost reduction initiatives.   Private Placement   On May 9, 2011, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell 1,044,644 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to trading restrictions, in a private placement financing with a select group of accredited investors, including certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company - 687,500 shares of restricted common stock were sold to non-affiliated investors at a price of $4.00 per share and 357,144 shares of restricted common stock were sold to three of the Company’s Directors at a price of $4.20 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $4,250,000.   In addition, on the same day, the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Mr. Gilbert, pursuant to which the Company (1) repaid, from the private placement proceeds, $4,250,000 of principal on the outstanding notes payable to Mr. Gilbert and (2) converted $5,750,000 of the principal amount of the notes payable held by Mr. Gilbert into 1,369,048 shares of common stock, subject to trading restrictions. A new note payable was issued to Mr. Gilbert equal to the remaining $4,815,000 principal balance of the existing notes payable following such conversion. The stock issued by the Company to Mr. Gilbert was done so based on the trading price of the Company’s stock and thus considered to be fair value based on a Level 1 input per ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, and accordingly no gain or loss resulted from the conversion.   The new note payable bears a maturity date of November 1, 2014 and an annual interest rate of 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6% will be payable in cash, and the remaining interest of 3% per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or "paid in kind" and added to the principal of the note payable. Interest payments will be made annually on October 31 of each year. On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   None.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   General   The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company’s business operations are discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment and estimates include: Page 18       Revenue Recognition   The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 104.”) SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company also recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 985-605 (SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”) as amended, when applicable. 	   The Company’s revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and solutions information as well as software products; (2) professional services; and (3) annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR® Radar Systems.   Revenues generated from subscription and maintenance agreements are recognized over the term of such executed agreements and/or customer’s receipt of such data or services. In accordance with ASC 985-605, we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products or performance of maintenance when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an agreement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products/services; (3) license or maintenance agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement, such that the sale may not be complete and/or final; and (4) collection is probable. The Company records revenues pursuant to individual contracts on a month-by-month basis, as outlined by the applicable agreement. In many cases, the Company may invoice respective customers in advance of the specified period, either quarterly or annually, which coincides with the terms of the agreement. In such cases, the Company will defer at the close of each month and/or reporting period, any subscription or maintenance revenues invoiced for which services have yet to be rendered, in accordance with ASC 985-605.   Our software licenses usually do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to a binding agreement to license the software. If a subscription agreement includes an acceptance provision, the Company will not recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the subscription agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period.   From time to time, the Company will receive one-time payments from customers for rights, including but not limited to, the rights to use certain data at an agreed upon location(s) for a specific use and/or for an unlimited number of users. Such one-time payments are in the form of license fees. These fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement or expected useful life of such license arrangement, whichever is longer, but typically five years.   Deferred revenue is classified on the Company’s balance sheet as a liability until such time as revenue from services is properly recognized as revenue in accordance with SAB 104 and/or ASC 985-605 and the corresponding agreement.   Capitalized Software Development Costs   The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 985-20 (SFAS 86, “ Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed ”). Capitalized software development costs are comprised of costs incurred to develop and significantly enhance software products to be sold or otherwise marketed. When technological feasibility is established, the Company begins to capitalize development costs, and once the software product is available for general release to the public, the Company begins to amortize such costs to cost of revenues.   The Company’s policy on capitalized software costs determines whether the costs incurred are classified as capitalized costs (in accordance with ASC 985-20) or as research and development expenses. In cases where the Company capitalizes costs incurred with development of new hardware/software products, a product specification is developed as the guideline for the capitalization of costs associated with such project in accordance with ASC 985-20.   Once a product has been made available for sale and/or released for sale to the general public, the development costs of that product are no longer capitalized and amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis based on the greater of the ratio of current gross revenues to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning at the point the product becomes available for general release, typically over five years. Costs incurred to maintain or support such product are expensed as incurred. In some cases, the Company may capitalize costs incurred in the development of enhanced versions of already existing products, but will immediately expense any additional costs incurred to maintain products which were completed and released to the general public, in accordance with ASC 985-20. Determining and evaluating whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization requires the exercise of judgment by management. Page 19       The Company’s net capitalized software costs totaled $4,642,000 at October 31, 2011. The carrying value of capitalized software costs are evaluated for impairment, based on the forecasted and actual future cash flows expected to be generated from such assets, as determined and evaluated by management.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 360-10 (SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”) The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized to the extent the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company evaluates the periods of amortization continually in determining whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. If estimates are changed, the unamortized costs will be allocated to the increased or decreased number of remaining periods in the revised life.   The Company’s long-lived assets, which include the PASSUR® Network and property, plant and equipment, totaled $6,654,000, and accounted for 49% of the Company’s total assets as of October 31, 2011.   At each reporting period, management evaluates the carrying values of the Company’s assets. The evaluation considers the undiscounted cash flows generated from current contractual revenue sources and the anticipated forecast revenue derived from each asset. The Company then evaluates these revenues on an overall basis to determine if any impairment issues exist. As of October 31, 2011, based upon management’s evaluation of the above asset groups, no impairment of these asset groups exist. If these forecasts are not met, the Company may have to record impairment charges not previously recorded.   Depreciation and Amortization   The net PASSUR® Network, net capitalized software development costs, and net property, plant and equipment totaled $6,282,000, $4,642,000, and $371,000, respectively, at October 31, 2011. Total depreciation and amortization expense related to these capitalized assets was $2,155,000 in fiscal year 2011. In management’s judgment, the estimated depreciable lives used to calculate the annual depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate.   Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:       PASSUR® Network     7 years     Capitalized software development costs     5 years     Property, plant and equipment     3 to 10 years     The PASSUR® Network includes PASSUR® Systems and the related software workstations used for the data derived from PASSUR® Systems, as well as costs pertaining to raw material, work-in-process, and finished goods components. PASSUR® Network installations include the direct and indirect production and installation costs incurred for each of the Company-owned PASSUR® Systems. PASSUR® Network Systems which are not installed in the PASSUR® Network are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. Once installed, the PASSUR® Systems are depreciated over seven years.   All of the Company’s capitalized assets are recorded at cost (which may also include salaries and related overhead costs incurred during production and/or development) and depreciated and/or amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life for financial statement purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, and industry standards for similar assets. Circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” above) are identified and prospective depreciation or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Page 20       Total depreciation and amortization expense was $2,155,000 in fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $1,364,000, $716,000, and $75,000 for the PASSUR® Network, capitalized software development costs, and property, plant and equipment, respectively.   Stock-Based Compensation   The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 718 (SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payments” ) which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant, and recognition of stock-based compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, net of forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense was $259,000 and $120,000 in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was primarily included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Specifically, the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. We do not expect that the adoption of this disclosure-only guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial results and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.   In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. This guidance amends United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. This includes clarification of the Board’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. In addition, to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions, some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that U.S. GAAP and IFRS fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way (for example, using the word “shall” rather than “should” to describe the requirements in U.S. GAAP). This amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on results of operations or financial position.   Item 7A.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with ESW's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the anticipated financial and operating results of ESW's business. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. ESW undertakes no obligation to publicly release any modifications or revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, ESW caution investors that actual financial and operating results may differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, ESW. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties inherent in forward-looking statements (are set forth in the Risk Factor disclosure contained elsewhere in this report). OVERVIEW Environmental Solutions Worldwide Inc. ("we," "us," "ESW" or the "Company") is a publicly traded company engaged through its wholly-owned subsidiaries ESW Canada Inc. (“ESWC”), ESW America Inc. (“ESWA”), Technology Fabricators Inc. (“TFI”) and ESW Technologies Inc. (“ESWT”), (together the "ESW Group of Companies") in the design, development, manufacture and sale of emission technologies and services. ESW is currently focused on the international medium duty and heavy duty diesel engine market for on-road and off-road vehicles as well as the utility engine, mining, marine, locomotive and military industries. ESW also offers engine and after treatment emissions verification testing and certification services. ESW's focus is to be an integrated solutions provider to the environmental emissions market by providing leading-edge catalyst technology as well as best-in-class engine and vehicle emissions testing and certification services. The Company's strategy is centered on identifying and deploying resources against its "sweet-spot" products, where ESW has identified its core competencies and differentiation in the marketplace. ESW's core geography focus is North America, and will opportunistically explore business development opportunities in other markets if accretive to the Company in the short term. By focusing financial, human and intellectual capital on ESW's core competencies and markets, the Company is targeting profitable growth in the short term and value creation for its shareholders over the long term.     19       Factors that are critical to ESW's success include winning new business, obtaining additional regulatory verifications for emission control products, managing and optimizing ESW's manufacturing capabilities to correspond with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in its manufacturing processes, and reducing overall costs. In addition, ESW's ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as increasing technologically sophisticated products, changing aftermarket distribution partners, and increasing environmental standards, also plays a critical role in its success. Other factors that are critical to ESW's success include adjusting to environmental and economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and ESW's ability to offset such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives and other methods. ESW has made significant efforts and investment to comply with new regulations which came into force in January of 2009. (See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - PRODUCT CERTIFICATION). ESW's ThermaCat Active Level III Plus catalyst system has been verified by CARB for a variety of on- and off-road engine applications (PM reduction greater than 85%). The ThermaCat filter system is a combined technology comprised of a chemically coated wire mesh substrate and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) combined with an electronically controlled external fuel injection component. The ThermaCat regeneration process is an electronically controlled exothermic reaction and occurs automatically during normal vehicle operation, transparent to the operator. The EPA's Voluntary Diesel Retrofit Program signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the State of California Air Resources Board for the coordination and reciprocity in diesel retrofit device verification. The EPA recognizes and accepts those retrofit hardware strategies or device-based systems that have been verified by CARB. This reciprocity agreement allows ESW's Therma Cat (TM) technology to be used in the remaining 49 states and it allows ESW to participate in EPA funded programs worldwide. In 2011, ESW focused on optimizing the Company's operations around its "sweet spots" and capturing a greater market share in the catalytic converter and emissions testing markets whilst ensuring steps towards profitable growth as compared to 2010. The key factors that are in ESW's favor are: (a) continued regulatory push for emissions reductions in the United States, (b) funding available from public agencies, (c) a market-leading Level III active catalytic converter technology and an established distribution network in North America, and (d) CARB and EPA certification and verification capable emissions and durability testing services. ESW believes that it can improve and achieve profitability and grow its business by pursuing the following strategy: • Focus on delivering controlled and profitable growth to its shareholders. • Provide integrated solutions to the emissions market by leveraging its product development, testing and certification services, and distribution and post-sale services capabilities. • Center the Company's sales strategy around identified "sweet-spots" that will allow manufacturing efficiency gains and optimized resource allocation. • Educate the end customers about the technology and ensure realistic delivery timeline expectations. • Enhance scheduling and customer service functions and importance. • Work with vendors to optimize ESW's material buys and lead times. • Constantly review operations, processes and products under a Continuous Improvement / Performance Based culture. To deliver against this strategic intent, in February and May 2011, ESW secured a total of $4 million in financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to affiliate shareholders (the "Bridge Lenders"). Proceeds of the notes, along with available cash, were used to fund working capital, capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The notes allowed the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with covenant obligations under the credit agreement with its senior lender dated March 10, 2010 for which the Company and subsidiaries had previously obtained waivers of covenant obligations that expired February 15, 2011.     20       Effective May 10, 2011, the Company announced that it had entered into an Investment Agreement with the Bridge Lenders, who are current shareholders and at the time were also subordinated lenders to ESW under unsecured promissory notes totaling $4.0 million. The Bridge Lenders agreed to provide a backstop commitment to a rights offering of the Company's common stock at a sale price of $0.12 per share (Qualified Offering) and agreed to collectively backstop the Qualified Offering by purchasing from the Company at a subscription price of $0.12 per share of Common Stock. The backstop provided for the participants of the Investment Agreement to buy any shares not purchased by the Company's shareholders of record that were entitled to participate in the rights offering (after giving effect to any oversubscriptions) up to 29,166,667 shares of Common Stock for a total purchase price of $3.5 million. On May 10, 2011 the Company filed a Registration Statement related to subscription rights to purchase Common Stock, $0.001 par value and the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of the subscription rights pursuant to the rights offering. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2011. The Company offered rights to existing shareholders of record as of June 9, 2011 to purchase approximately $8 million in shares of common stock. The rights offering sought to raise cash for the Company to meet its working capital needs and pay down ESW’s senior lender. The rights offering allowed for all subordinated lenders to exchange their unsecured subordinated promissory notes (and other notes paid in-kind for the payment of interest under the notes) for shares of common stock under the offering. On June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering. A total of 66,670,012 shares were issued as part of the rights offering and related transactions, $3.9 million was raised in cash and $4.1 million was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes. Under the Rights Offering, shareholders subscribed for 15,590,234 shares for approximately $1.9 million in cash. The Bridge Lenders subscribed for 23,228,970 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.12 per share, which was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes of approximately $2.8 million. Pursuant to the backstop commitment, the Bridge Lenders purchased 27,714,385 shares of Common Stock at price of $0.12 per share for approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.0 million was paid in cash and $1.3 million was paid for through the exchange of the balance of principal and accrued interest due on the Notes. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. Effective July 18, 2011, ESWC paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, encumbrances and securities against ESW and its subsidiaries and cancelled the March 31, 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement. The additional capital raised by the rights offering is expected to give ESW the opportunity to execute against its short term and medium term plans. ESW has made significant investments in research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals for its technologies. On August 23, 2011, ESW received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") that the Company's XtrmCat Kit is now certified for 2 stroke, Category 2, marine engines. The issuance of the 'remanufacturing certificate' is a significant milestone for the Company as it validates the DOC technology for the marine market sector. The Certifications are applicable to Electro-Motive Diesel (“EMD”) 710 and 645 engines. The XtrmCat can achieve Tier 0 and Tier I compliance as per 40 CFR 1042 when retrofitted to EMD 710 and 645 engines. ESW is pursuing opportunities to commercialize this technology into the marketplace. The products that ESW is pursuing for verification / certification to cover the following primary technology levels established by CARB: • Expansion of On Road Active Diesel Particulate Filter verification to include Exhaust Gas Recirculation engines for Level III +- PM reduction greater than 85%. • ESW's XtrmCat product designed for locomotive, Tier 0, turbocharged EMD 645 and 710 engines was tested at an EPA recognized facility for certification during March and April 2011 along with the marine product. Certification applications for the rail product are pending with the EPA.     21       ESW believes that with the additional certifications/verification of the above range of products, ESW will cover a significant portion of the market and give ESW the competitive advantage to be the technology of first choice in retrofit and OEM applications. ESW is not contemplating pursuing verification for a Level II and/or Level I product in North America and will opportunistically explore deployment of these products in overseas markets. The cost of developing a complete range of products to meet regulations is substantial. ESW believes that it possesses a competitive advantage in ensuring regulatory compliance by leveraging its Testing and Research facility in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania to support its certification and verification efforts. ESW has also managed to offset some of these development costs through the application of research grants and tax refunds. ESW has made the following adjustments to its business in 2011: 1) ESW has reviewed and continues to review its costs for inefficiencies and has taken steps to reduce its operating expenses. Key cost reduction initiatives during the first half 2011 included the restructuring of its management team, the termination of certain contracts and the re-negotiation of board and consulting obligations, amongst others. In addition, during the second semester of the year, ESW reduced its overhead costs by re-locating its Canadian manufacturing operations to its facilities located in the State of Pennsylvania in the United States. ESW believes that the synergies from operating at a single location will provide significant financial and logistical advantages, as well as synergies with its testing operations. In addition, the move to the United States will help mitigate currency risk as currently all of ESW’s revenues are from the United States and a significant portion of ESW’s raw materials and components are being sourced from the United States. Key components of our transition plan have been completed. For the Canadian facility at Concord, Ontario ESW has retained a commercial real estate broker and the facility is being marketed for a sub-lease or re-lease ESW expects to transition out of the Canadian facility by June 30, 2012. ESW is also offsetting a portion of the relocation and training costs through state grants provided by the State of Pennsylvania. In addition, ESW has also applied to the State of Pennsylvania for up to $500,000 capital financing under its economic development programs, initial approval for the loan has been received and ESW is in the process of process of finalizing principal, security and terms.ESW has transitioned the production from Concord, Ontario, Canada to its existing facility located in Montgomeryville, PA. During the last quarter of 2011 all products were produced and shipped from Montgomeryville, PA. ESW has made changes to its Canadian operations and the phased reduction in headcount has been completed. ESW will continuously revisit opportunities to further streamline the business. 2) Since January 2010 there has been a significant increase in the cost of material and components that ESW uses. ESW has revised the pricing to its dealers to help recover product margins. The first phase of the price increases was implemented on June 30, 2011. ESW has also revised its overall commercial policies, including its general terms and conditions and lead time expectations on its products. Changes have also been implemented to ESW's costing and quoting processes, including frequent periodic review of its bill of materials and the proactive negotiation of raw material prices. 3) ESW is focusing on increasing sales volumes on its core "sweet spot" products to reduce production complexities and improve inventory management. ESW is has also implemented new continuous improvement programs such as the cross-functional "Product and Process Review" stream led by ESW's engineering team searching for product, product quality and product development process enhancements. 4) ESW has revisited relationships with critical vendors, in addition to setting up favorable payment plans to reduce the outstanding balances with these vendors. ESW has also secured and continues to secure volume discounts on critical components. ESW has also identified and engaged new vendors in the U.S. for parts supply. In addition, there is a greater focus on outsourcing opportunity for labor intensive parts.   5) ESW has revised and implemented its new warranty policy to ensure that warranty terms and conditions meet industry standards whilst mitigating warranty risks to the fullest extent possible. ESW has also launched a backend website to assist its distributors and installers in day to day operations, training and processes.     22       6) ESW is in the process of continuously engaging its existing dealers to help better understand ESW's business and product positioning and to strengthen ESW's partnership with its distribution base. ESW is also opportunistically adding new independent emissions focused dealers to enhance the Company’s North American sales coverage. 7) ESW is focusing on increasing revenue from testing services provided to third parties from its Air Testing Facility in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. In 2011, ESW’s Air Testing Services in Montgomeryville, PA has seen a sizeable increase in business, in line with ESW’s effort to increase revenues from these operations. Revenue from offering air testing as a service to outside customers has increased from $ 153,379 for the year ended 2010 to $581,591 for the year ended 2011. As a result from these actions, the Company is positioned to improve its operational results in 2012. The Company has reduced inefficiencies in personnel-related costs, manufacturing costs and other discretionary expenditures that are within the Company's control. The Company is also seeking to lower its overhead costs while maintaining its focus on the Sales, Marketing and Customer Service efforts. The changes in the business are anticipated to lower the overall operating costs in the Company and improve the Company's overall results, without affecting the Company's positioning of its existing products and testing services as well as its efforts to develop and deliver to market the next generation of leading emissions products and services. COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $1,448,520, or 13.9 percent, to $11,885,665 from $10,437,145 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in revenue is mainly related to a 17% increase sales of ESW's verified ThermaCat Level III products, further complemented by an increase in revenues of ESW America’s air testing operations, revenue from air testing as a service to outside customers has increased from $ 153,379 for the year ended 2010 to $581,591 for the year ended 2011. These revenue increases were offset by decreases in sales of the CleanCat product that was not sold in 2011 and a decrease in revenues for the XtrmCat marine product, which received certification in August 2011. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 81.7 percent compared to 69.6 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $2,451,354 or 33.76 percent. The primary reason for the lower gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was: (a) the write-down of inventory in the amount of $638,048, of this amount $223,007 has been setup as a reserve at December 31, 2011 and relates to the higher overhead costs of the Canadian operations, (b) increases in the cost of materials of $964,913 mainly driven by the increasing cost of precious metals, components and supplies used in production (c) an increase in overhead costs of $717,709 as we apply higher overheads to our cost of sales that was previously expensed as operating expenses, and (d) an increase of $130,684 in labour cost that was also previously expensed as operating expenses. The Company is constantly reviewing its production costing and has updated the pricing of its products to distributors. In addition, ESW has also streamlined its manufacturing operations by relocating the manufacturing operations to Montgomeryville, PA, where it is co-located with the air testing operations, which reduces manufacturing overhead expense. Marketing, office and general expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $827,548, or 17.5 percent, to $3,891,814 from $4,719,362 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to: (a) a decrease in Sales and Marketing wages and selling expenses by $194,613, resulting from a decrease in Sales and Marketing wages and a reversal of bad debt provisions on December 31, 2010, (b) a decrease of $88,961 in facility costs as we apply higher facility overheads to cost of sales, (c) a decrease in factory expenses of $259,125 resulting from higher overheads applied to cost of sales, (d) a decrease in administration salaries and wages of $49,375 resulting from restructuring activities, (e) a decrease in investor relation costs of $98,663 resulting from cancellation of an investor relation contract, and (f) a decrease in general administration costs of $136,811 resulting from restructuring activities. During the fourth quarter of 2011, all manufacturing operations were conducted out of the Montgomeryville, PA facility and the rent for the Canadian facility for this period has been expensed as Marketing, office and general expenses under facility costs. ESW has retained a commercial real estate broker and the facility is being marketed for a sub-lease or re-lease ESW expects to transition completely out of the Canadian facility by June 30, 2012.     23       The Company incurred $1,385,685 in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 (December 31, 2010 - $0), due to severance and other related payments. The Company incurred severance expenses related to separation agreements with its former Chief Executive Officer, Vice President of Operations and Director of Sales in the amount of $450,309, and separation agreements for the second round of restructuring as a result of relocation of operations in the amount of $297,846. The total of all severance agreements with employees amounted to $748,155. The details of the restructuring charges are as follows:     Details     $     Severance agreements     $   748,155     Software impairment     133,542     Product line changes     125,113     Training and set up expenses     172,748     Travel costs     62,933     Moving expenses     40,025     Legal fees     26,467     Relocation costs     22,437     Others     54,265           $1,385,685 Research and development ("R&D") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $90,967, or 11.6 percent, to $692,977 from $783,944 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The primary driver of R&D expenses for the fiscal year 2011 related to ESW's pursuit of the certification of its locomotive and marine product, the XtrmCat, including the final EPA certification testing at a recognized testing facility. To offset this increase, the Company received grant money amounting to $278,712 and $143,375 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Officers’ compensation and directors’ fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $253,914, or 26.6 percent, to $700,140 from $954,054 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is mainly due to changes in executive management and the Company’s board compensation structure. Consulting and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $114,822, or 25.4 percent, to $336,523 from $451,345 for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the prior year period expenses were higher and related to (a) legal fees for ESW’s March 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement with a Canadian chartered bank, (b) higher audit fees, (c) fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 consulting, and (d) fees related to a management consultant. Foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $248,306 as compared to a loss of $103,256 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Due to the change in accounting policy, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, ESW recognized a translation loss of $186,812, which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 56.3 percent from $837,448 to $366,266 year-on-year. In the year ended December 31, 2011 the depreciation costs were substantially lower as (a) we did not depreciate assets held for sale and scrapped as a result of the relocation of operations from Canada, (b) we applied additional depreciation to cost of sales, (c) patents were fully amortized, and (d) a portion of the assets have been fully depreciated. The Company has recorded an impairment loss of $163,668 for property, plant and equipment of ESW Canada for the year ended December 31, 2011. ESW recovered $131,570 from sales of assets with no further recovery estimated from the sale of plant and machinery and office equipment, with the remaining plant and machinery and office equipment remaining in Canada being fully written down. The balance of the plant and machinery and office equipment has been transferred to Montgomeryville, PA. The leasehold improvements have been fully written down as the operations have been relocated from the Concord, Ontario, facility. Loss on impairment of property plant and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.     24       Loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $938,804 or 20.1 percent, to $5,612,564 from $4,673,760 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Of the $5,612,564 in loss from operations, $2,097,383 was attributed to non cash losses for the year ended December 31, 2011, including depreciation and amortization of $735,030, loss on impairment of property plant and equipment of $295,238, write-down of inventory in the amount of $638,048, stock based compensation of $180,761 and a foreign exchange loss of $248,306. In addition, the Company has also incurred $1,385,685 of expenses related to the restructuring of its operations. Interest expense on long-term debt related to Convertible Debentures was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $183,858 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Amortization of deferred costs amounted to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $117,131 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Long term debt accretion expenses amounted to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $768,981 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Effective March 25, 2010, the November 2008 and the August 2009 debenture holders agreed to convert all outstanding convertible debentures as per the terms of the respective debenture agreements. The early conversion of the debentures was a condition precedent to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESW Canada, entering into a new credit facility with CIBC. The conversion of the November 2008 and the August 2009 debentures also triggered the mandatory conversion feature on the March 19, 2010, debentures. As part of the agreement to convert all existing convertible debentures the Company has paid a premium as an inducement to convert all debentures. The premium was payable to all converting debenture holders and was subject to a positive fairness opinion by a Fairness Committee consisting of independent directors of the Company's Board of Directors and an increase in the share capital of the Company. The premium consists of 4,375,665 shares of Common Stock. As the Company did not have sufficient authorized shares as of the date of conversion of the debentures to fulfill the premium, the premium had been recorded as an advance share purchase agreement at fair market value $2,909,872 at September 30, 2010. The agreement was without interest, subordinated to the banks position and payable in a fixed number of common shares (4,375,665 shares) of the Company upon increase in the authorized share capital of the Company. In summary, the fair value of the advanced share subscription was dependent on the market price of the Company's common stock, as the Company did not have sufficient available authorized common shares to fulfill this obligation as on September 30, 2010. The advanced share subscription was re-valued based on the market price of the Company's common stock at the end of each reporting period until it was fulfilled by the issuance of authorized common shares in November 2010. The resulting revaluations either cause gains or losses on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Share Subscription Agreement for the 2010 Debentures contained an exchange feature. The exchange feature provided that if within twelve months from March 19, 2010, the Company entered into or closed another financing or other transaction (which for securities law purposes would be integrable with the offer and sale of the Securities) on terms and conditions more favorable to another purchaser, the terms and conditions of the 2010 Debentures shall be adjusted to reflect the more favorable terms. On March 31, 2011, the Company re-evaluated the fair value of the exchange feature and determined that the probability of closing another financing was 100% and the conversion price of the 2010 Debentures would be reset. On March 31, 2011, an additional liability of $578,739 was recorded for the exchange feature in these consolidated financial statements with a $578,739 expense related to change in fair value of exchange feature liability recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Change in fair value of exchange feature liability for the year ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $578,739 as compared to $2,021,213 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company incurred $126,850 interest cost on notes payable to related party for the $4 million unsecured subordinated promissory notes during for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $11,342 for the $500,000 unsecured subordinated promissory notes during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded interest accretion expense of $3,506,074 (2010 - $0), a financing charge on embedded derivative liability of $485,101 (2010 - $0) and a gain on convertible derivative of $1,336,445 (2010 - $0) related to the discount feature and the embedded derivative features in the $4 million notes payable to related party. Bank fees resulting from credit facility covenant waivers related to ESW’s secured demand credit agreement amounted to $154,205 for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010 - $0).     25       Restructuring of manufacturing operations : In August 2011, ESW adopted a reorganization plan to reduce its overhead costs by re-locating its Canadian manufacturing operations into its facilities located in the United States. ESW believes that the synergies from operating at a single location will provide significant financial and logistical advantages, as well as synergies with its testing operations also located in the same facility. ESW has transitioned the production from Concord, Ontario, Canada to its existing facility located in Montgomeryville, PA, United States, during the fourth quarter of 2011 all products were manufactured and shipped from the United States. ESW recognized a loss on impairment of property plant and equipment of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and restructuring charges amounted to $1,385,685. In addition, ESW expects to incur additional restructuring charges associated with the closure of the facility, transfer of manufacturing equipment excluding any severance charges during the first half of fiscal 2012. In accordance with ASC 420-10-25-11 costs to terminate an operating lease" arise when a lessee will either: (a) terminate an operating lease; or (b) if it is unable to terminate the lease, discontinue its use of the asset and continue to make lease payments over the remaining term of the lease without benefit. When the lease will be terminated, the lessee should recognize a liability for the cost of terminating the lease at the time the lease is terminated. If the lease will not be terminated and the lessee will continue to incur costs under the lease without future benefit, the lessee should recognize a liability on the cease-use date (the date the lessee discontinues its use of the asset). In accordance with paragraphs 420-10-30-7 through 30-9, a liability for the remaining lease rentals, reduced by actual (or estimated) sublease rentals, would be recognized and measured at its fair value at the cease-use date. In accordance with paragraphs 420-10-35-1 through 35-4:, the liability would be adjusted for changes, if any, resulting from revisions to estimated cash flows after the cease-use date, measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to measure the liability initially. The fair value estimate at the cease-use date amounts to $0.14 million associated with the release of its manufacturing facility at Concord, Ontario, Canada. This fair value estimate will be re-measured and recorded as a liability at June 30, 2012 the expected cease use date of the facility, any sub-lease or rent earned from the Concord, Ontario, Canada facility in excess of the fair value estimate will be used to offset this liability. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ESW's principal sources of operating capital have been the proceeds from its various financing transactions. During year ended December 31, 2011, the Company used $2,643,776 of cash to sustain operating activities compared with $5,875,140 for year ended December 31, 2010. As of At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,103,649 and $13,328, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended amounted to $2,643,776. This amount was attributable to the net loss of $9,127,088, plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, interest accretion expense, change in fair value of exchange feature liability and others of $5,066,467, and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $1,416,845. Net cash used in operating activities for year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $5,875,140. This amount was attributable to the net loss of $9,447,641, plus non cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, interest and accretion on long term debt, inducement premium on conversion of debentures and others of $6,370,409, and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $2,797,908. Net cash used in investing activities was $252,385 for year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $414,188 used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,000,712 for year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $5,570,429 for year ended December 31, 2010. In fiscal year 2011, $4,000,000 was provided through the issuance of the notes payable to related parties and $3,857,997 from the issuance of common stock through a rights offering. From the funds raised, $419,410 was paid towards rights offering costs, $3,434,075 was repaid under ESW's CIBC credit facility and $3,800 was repaid under capital lease obligation. In the prior year 2010, $2,919,375 (net of $80,625 debt issuance costs) was provided through issuance of convertible debentures, $3,312,254 in funds was provided by ESW`s bank loan, $576,000 (net of broker fees of $24,000) from the issuance of common stock. From the funds raised in fiscal year 2010, $500,000 was repaid promissory notes to a related party, and $13,769 was repaid under capital lease obligation.     26       ESW operates in a capital intensive and highly regulated industry, where a long lead time to bring new products into market is considered normal. ESW continues to invest in research and development to improve its technologies and bring them to the point where its customers have a high confidence level to purchase our products. During year ended December 31, 2011 and in 2010, ESW did not produce sufficient cash from operations to support its expenditures. Prior financings supported the Company's operations during the period. ESW's principal use of liquidity relates to the Company's working capital needs and to finance any further capital expenditures or tooling needed for production and/or its testing facilities. ESW anticipates certain capital expenditures in 2012 related to the general operation of its business as well as to upgrade the air testing facilities in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Overall, capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed quarterly by the Board of Directors. Effective March 31, 2010, ESWC entered into a demand revolving credit facility agreement with a Canadian chartered bank, CIBC to meet working capital requirements (the "Demand Credit Agreement"). The Demand Credit Agreement had a credit limit of $4 million Canadian. Borrowings under the Demand Credit Agreement were limited to a percentage of accounts receivable plus a percentage of inventories (capped at CAD$ 1 million or 50% of the accounts receivable portion) less any prior ranking claims. Effective May 31, 2011, ESWC entered into a modification of its Demand Credit Agreement dated March 10, 2010 (the "Demand Credit Agreement") whereby it received an extension on the term of its Credit Agreement from its commercial lender through September 30, 2011. The new modification was subject to all covenants and the security margin under the Credit Agreement remaining in order at all times. The commercial lender and the Company agreed to reduce the Operating Loan limit as defined in the Credit Agreement to a maximum of $1,500,000 Canadian or the borrowing base established by the security margin if less; all loans made by the commercial lender were to be satisfied and the credit facilities cancelled upon the earlier of the completion of the Company's rights offering or June 30, 2011. In February 2011, ESW secured $3 million in additional financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes (collectively, "the Notes"). Proceeds of the Notes, along with available cash, will be used to fund working capital, planned capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The Company required additional working capital to secure and deliver the second quarter sales opportunities. On May 3, 2011, the Company secured $1 million in additional financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to affiliate shareholders. On June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering. A total of 66,670,012 shares were issued as part of the rights offering and related transactions, $3.9 million was raised in cash and $4.1 million was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Unsecured Subordinated Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) issued to related parties (the “Bridge Lenders”) in February and May of 2011. Under the Rights Offering, shareholders subscribed for 15,590,234 shares for approximately $1.9 million in cash. The Bridge Lenders subscribed for 23,228,970 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.12 per share, which was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes of approximately $2.8 million. Pursuant to backstop commitment, the Bridge Lenders purchased 27,714,385 shares of Common Stock at price of $0.12 per share for approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.0 million was paid in cash and $1.3 million was paid for through the exchange of the balance of principal and accrued interest due on the Notes. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. Effective July 18, 2011, ESWC paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, securities and encumbrances against ESW and its subsidiaries and the March 31, 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement has been cancelled. ESW has 700,000 Class A special shares, authorized, issued and outstanding, recorded at $453,900 (based on the historical exchange rate at the time of issuance). The Class A special shares are issued by BBL Technologies, Inc. ("BBL") without par value, and are redeemable on demand by the Holder of the shares which is a private Ontario Corporation at $700,000 Canadian (which translates to $688,310 U.S. and $703,801 U.S. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively). As the redeemable Class A special shares were issued by the BBL, the maximum value upon which the Company is liable is the net book value of BBL. As of December 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, BBL had an accumulated deficit of $1,194,705 U.S. ($1,847,203 Canadian) and $1,192,858 U.S. ($1,845,375 Canadian) respectively, and therefore, the holder would be unable to redeem the redeemable Class A special shares at their ascribed value.     27       Competition is expected to intensify as the market for ESW's products expands. ESW's ability to continue to gain significant market share will depend upon its ability to continue to develop strong relationships with distributors, regulators, customers and develop new products. Increased competition in the market place could result in lower average pricing which could adversely affect ESW's margins and pricing for its products. DEBT STRUCTURE At December 31, 2011 ESW had of $0 of debt on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2010 ESW had a Bank loan of $3,424,889 and Exchange feature liability of $2,133,862. Effective March 19, 2010, the Company issued $3,000,000 of its 9% convertible debentures (the "Debentures") to five (5) accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D. The Debentures were for a term of three (3) years and were convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the holder by dividing the principal amount of the Debenture to be converted by $0.50. The Debentures earned interest at a rate of 9% per annum payable in cash or in shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the holder. If the Holder elected to receive interest in shares of common stock, the number of shares of common stock to be issued for interest would be determined by dividing accrued interest by $0.50. The Debentures had a mandatory conversion feature that required the holders to convert in the event a majority of the Company's pre-existing outstanding 9% convertible debentures converted. Subject to the holder's right to convert and the mandatory conversion feature, the Company had the right to redeem the Debentures at a price equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) multiplied by the then outstanding principal amount plus unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Upon maturity, the debenture and interest was payable in cash or common stock at the option of the Holder. The Company also had provided the holders of the Debentures registration rights. The Debentures contained customary price adjustment protections. Effective March 25, 2010, the November 2008 and the August 2009 debenture holders agreed to convert all outstanding convertible debentures as per the terms of the respective debenture agreements. The early conversion of the debentures was a condition precedent to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary ESW Canada entering into a new credit facility with CIBC. The conversion of the November 2008 and the August 2009 debentures also triggered the mandatory conversion feature on the March 19, 2010 debentures. As part of the agreement to convert all existing convertible debentures the Company has paid a share-based premium as an inducement to convert all debentures. The premium was payable to all converting debenture holders and was subject to a positive fairness opinion, provided by a Fairness Committee consisting of independent directors of the Company's Board of Directors, and an increase in the share capital of the Company. The premium consisted of 4,375,665 shares of Common Stock. As the Company did not have sufficient authorized shares as of the date of conversion of the debentures to fulfill the premium, the premium had been recorded as an advance share purchase agreement at fair market value $2,909,872 at June 30, 2010 ($0 at June 30, 2011), the agreement was without interest, subordinated to the banks position and payable in a fixed number of common shares (4,375,665 shares) of the Company upon a subsequent increase in the authorized share capital of the Company. In summary, the fair value of the advanced share subscription was dependent on the market price of the Company's common stock, as the Company did not have sufficient available authorized common shares to fulfill this obligation as on June 30, 2010, it was treated as a liability. The advanced share subscription was re-valued based on the market price of the Company's common stock at the end of each reporting period until it was fulfilled by the issuance of authorized common shares in November 2010. Gains and losses from the resulting revaluations were recognized on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Share Subscription Agreement for the 2010 Debentures contained an exchange feature. The exchange feature provides that if within twelve months from March 19, 2010, the Company entered into or closed another financing or other transaction (which for securities law purposes would be integrable with the offer and sale of the Securities) on terms and conditions more favorable to another purchaser, the terms and conditions of the 2010 Debentures shall be adjusted to reflect the more favorable terms. On March 31, 2011, the Company re-evaluated the fair value of the exchange feature and determined that the probability of closing another financing was 100% and the conversion price of the 2010 Debentures would be reset. On March 31, 2011 an additional liability of $578,739 was recorded for the exchange feature in these consolidated financial statements with a $578,739 expense related to change in fair value of exchange feature liability recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. On June 30, 2011 concurrent with the closing of the rights offering the exchange feature liability was moved to paid in capital.     28       Effective March 31, 2010 ESWC entered into the Demand Credit Agreement. The Demand Credit Agreement has a credit limit of CAD $4 million. Borrowings under the facility were limited to a percentage of accounts receivable plus a percentage of inventories (capped at CAD $1 million or 50% of the accounts receivable portion) less any prior ranking claims. The Demand Credit Agreement was guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries ESW Canada Inc., ESW America Inc., BBL Technologies Inc., and ESW Technologies Inc., through a general security agreement over all assets to its senior lender. The Demand Credit Agreement had been guaranteed to the bank under the EDC's Export Guarantee Program. Borrowings under the Demand Credit Agreement bear interest at 4.5% above the bank's prime rate of interest. Obligations under the Demand Credit Agreement were collateralized by a first-priority lien on the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other tangible and intangible property, including the capital stock of all direct subsidiaries. The terms relating to the Demand Credit Agreement specifically note that the Company maintain a tangible net worth of at least $4.0 million. The Demand Credit Agreement contained, among other things, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default customary for a facility of this type for the Company and its subsidiaries. Such covenants include certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and other investments, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other repurchases in respect of capital stock, voluntary prepayments of certain other indebtedness, capital expenditures and transactions with affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. Under certain conditions amounts outstanding under the credit agreements may be accelerated. Such events include failure to comply with covenants, breach of representations or warranties in any material respect, non-payment or acceleration of other material debt, entry of material judgments not covered by insurance, or a change of control of the Company. From November 8, 2010 through February 14, 2011, ESWC received waivers of certain financial covenants under the Demand Credit Agreement. Without the waivers, ESWC would not be in compliance with certain covenants in the Demand Credit Agreement. On February 17, 2011, the Company raised a $3 million through the issuance of unsecured subordinated promissory notes. With the proceeds of the Notes, the Company became compliant with covenant obligations under the Demand Credit Agreement with CIBC. Effective July 18, 2011, ESW’s wholly-owned subsidiary ESW Canada Inc, paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, securities and encumbrances against ESW and its subsidiaries credit facility agreement has been cancelled. As of December 31, 2011, $0 was owed under the Demand Credit Agreement compared to $ 3,424,889 as of December 31, 2010. On February 17, 2011, the Company entered into note subscription agreements (collectively, the "Loan Agreements"), and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to, nine lenders, who are current shareholders and deemed affiliates of certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Subordinated Lenders"). The Loan Agreements were approved by the independent directors of the Company. As per the Loan Agreements, the Subordinated Lenders made loans to the Company in the principal aggregate amount of $3 million, represented by unsecured subordinated promissory notes (the "Notes"), dated February 17, 2011. Proceeds of the Loan, along with available cash, were used to fund working capital, planned capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The Notes bore interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable in-kind on a monthly basis commencing March 17, 2011, up to the date on which the Note has been paid in full. The maturity date of the Loans was the earlier of: (i) the closing of a rights offering of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, at a sale price of $0.12 per share ( adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or other similar adjustment) pursuant to which the Company planned to offer rights to purchase approximately up to $8 million in shares of Common Stock the ("Qualified Offering"), and would also permit all Subordinated Lenders to exchange their Notes, accrued interest (and the any Notes that may be issued for payment of interest) for shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share or (ii) June 17, 2011 (the "Outside Date"). The Qualified Offering was also been approved by the independent directors of the Company. Subsequently on May 3, 2011, the Company entered into additional note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes (the “Bridge Notes”) to, nine lenders, who are current shareholders and were subordinated lenders under prior loan agreements in the aggregate amount of $3 million with the Company entered into February 17, 2011 and may be deemed affiliates of the Company. The Bridge Notes were approved by the Company's independent directors. Pursuant to the Loan agreements, the Subordinated Lenders agreed made loans to the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $1 million subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements and represented by unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes, effective as of April 27, 2011. Proceeds of the Bridge Loan, along with available cash, were used by the Company to fund working capital.     29       Effective May 10, 2011, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with Orchard Investments, LLC ("Orchard"); Black Family 1997 Trust; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Alexander Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Benjamin Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Joshua Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Victoria Black; Leon D. Black; John J. Hannan and Richard Ressler ("Ressler")(each individually a "Bridge Lender" and collectively the "Bridge Lenders"). Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Bridge Lenders agreed to provide a backstop commitment to the Qualified Offering by purchasing from the Company at a subscription price of $0.12 per share of Common Stock any shares not purchased by the Company's shareholders of record who were entitled to participate in the rights offering (after giving effect to any oversubscriptions) up to 29,166,667 shares of Common Stock for a total purchase price of $3.5 million (the "Backstop Commitment"). In addition to their rights to purchase shares pursuant to the Qualified Offering and the Backstop Commitment, the Bridge Lenders have the option, in their sole discretion, to purchase from the Company, at the subscription price, any other shares not purchased by the Company's stockholders through the Qualified Offering (the "Purchase Option"). If, after giving effect to the Qualified Offering, the Backstop Commitment and the Purchase Option, any of the Bridge Lenders shall have been unable to exchange any portion of his or its Notes, the Company will also offer each Bridge Lender the right to purchase additional shares of Common Stock at the subscription price (payable through the exchange of Bridge Loans for Common Stock) such that each Bridge Lender shall have exchanged all of his or its notes for shares of Common Stock (the "Additional Subscription Offer"). In addition, if Ressler and Orchard collectively acquire less than $1.0 million worth of shares of Common Stock as part of the Qualified Offering, the Backstop Commitment, the Purchase Option and the Additional Subscription Offer, the Company has agreed to offer to Ressler and Orchard an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the shortfall amount at the subscription price. Effective June 14, 2011, the respective holders of ESW’s 10% unsecured subordinated promissory notes issued February 17, 2011 and May 3, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $4 million (collectively the "Notes") pursuant to the terms of the Notes, extended the maturity date of the Notes to July 15, 2011. Effective June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering, as part of the rights offering and the Investment Agreement, the principal due on the Notes and the Bridge Notes in the aggregate amount of $4,000,000 and corresponding interest in the amount of $126,850 were converted into Common stock at the rights offering price of $0.12 per share. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. ESW's ability to service its future indebtedness, other obligations and commitments in cash will depend on its future performance and ability to raise capital, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Certain of these factors are beyond ESW's control. ESW believes that, based upon its current business plan it will meet its debt service obligations when due. ESW may need additional financing meet its financial projections and obligations. Significant assumptions underlie ESW's projections, including, among other things, that ESW will be successful in implementing its business strategy, that some of ESW's products that have received verification from the appropriate regulatory authorities will obtain customer and market acceptance, and that there will be no material adverse developments in ESW's business, liquidity or capital requirements. If ESW cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness and to meet other obligations and commitments, ESW might be required to refinance or to dispose off assets to obtain funds for such purpose. There is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions or raising funds from sales of equity or otherwise could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In such circumstance, ESW would have to issue shares of its common stock as repayment of these obligations, which would be of a dilutive nature to ESW's present shareholders. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS LEASES Effective November 24, 2004, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESWA, entered into a lease agreement for approximately 40,220 square feet of leasehold space at 2 Bethlehem Pike Industrial Center, Montgomery Township, Pennsylvania. The leasehold space houses the Company's research and development facilities and also houses ESW’s new manufacturing operations. The lease commenced on January 15, 2005 and was to expire January 31, 2010. Effective October 16, 2009, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary ESWA entered into a lease renewal agreement with Nappen & Associates for the leasehold property in Pennsylvania. There were no modifications to the original economic terms of the lease under the lease renewal agreement. Under the terms of the lease renewal, the lease term will now expire February 28, 2013. Effective March 31, 2011, ESWA entered into a lease amendment agreement with Nappen & Associates for the leasehold property in Pennsylvania, whereby ESWA has the sole option to extend the expiry of the lease agreement by an additional 3 years if exercised, six months prior to February 28, 2013; there were no modifications to the original economic terms of the lease.     30       Effective December 20, 2004, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESWC, entered into an offer to lease agreement for approximately 50,000 square feet of leasehold space in Concord, Ontario, Canada. The leasehold space houses the Company's executive offices and previously housed the manufacturing operations. The possession of the leasehold space took place on May 24, 2005 and the term of the lease was extended to September 30, 2010. ESWC renewed its lease agreement at the current property for an additional five year term. The renewed lease period commenced on October 1, 2010 and ends on September 30, 2015. The following is a summary of the minimum annual lease payments, for both leases.     YEAR                       2012     454,642     2013     306,305     2014     283,603     2015     212,703           $1,257,253 LEGAL MATTERS From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, ESW believes that the resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on ESW because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect ESW's financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION The Company is committed to the following lease payments in connection with the acquisition of equipment under capital leases:     YEAR                       2012     1,259                 Less imputed interest     (18)     Total obligation under capital lease     1,241                 Less current portion     (1,241)     Total long-term portion     $ 0 The Company incurred $17 and $2,374 of interest expense on capital lease obligation for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS Restructuring charges relate to changes in the management and reductions in work force of the Company's subsidiary, ESW Canada Inc., hiring, training, moving, relocation charges related to the setup of the new subsidiary, Technology Fabricators Inc. and write downs related to changes in business strategy as a result of the decision to relocate operations. Restructuring expenses consist mainly of severance expenses amounting to $748,155, travel costs of $62,933, legal fees of $26,467, recruiting cost of $34,624, training and set up expenses of $172,748, moving expenses of $40,025, relocation expenses of certain employees of $22,437, write down due to software impairment $133,542, write down due to product line discontinuation $125,113 and other expenses of $19,641. The Company does not expect to incur further expenses related to severance agreements related to the 2011 restructuring plans, but could incur additional restructuring costs related to its Canadian facility.     31       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESW's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in the United States ("US GAAP"). A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of ESW's financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on ESW's financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates generally require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and if different estimates or judgments were used, the use of these estimates or judgments would have a material effect on ESW's financial condition or results of operations. The estimates and judgments ESW makes that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are based on historical experience and on various other factors, which ESW believes to be reasonable in the circumstances under which they are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ESW considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition, the valuation of inventories, research and development and accounting for the value of long-lived assets and intangible assets to be critical accounting policies. The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements of this 10-K report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ESW is exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has foreign currency exposures at its foreign operations related to buying and selling currencies other than the local currencies. The risk under these interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreement is not considered to be significant. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ESW's exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses also arises from the translation of the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries to U.S. dollars during consolidation. These risks have been significantly mitigated by the move of ESW’s manufacturing operations to PA USA. During the year, the Company changed the functional currency of its Canadian operations from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar, see Note 3. Prior to this change, ESW recognized a translation loss of $102,366 in 2011 as compared to a gain of $21,166 in 2010 reported as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity / (deficit). Following the change in accounting policy, ESW recognized a translation loss of $186,812, which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Also included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, ESW has recognized a translation loss of $61,494 as compared to a loss of $103,256 in 2010 primarily as a result of exchange rate differences between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.  INTEREST RATE RISK ESW currently has no variable-rate long-term debt that exposes ESW to interest rate risk.     32       		</c>

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION   The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes accompanied thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP” ).   General Discussion:   ACOR’s 2011 fiscal year was another challenging year due to the return of flooding conditions covering most of the oil and gas concessions under which the Company holds an interest. Because of the flooding only one well was drilled and completed as a producer during 2011 on the Company’s properties in Australia.   ACOR began its movement from being primarily an oil royalty company to an exploration company in 2000 when ACOR et al was awarded three large concessions in South Australia. ACOR entered into a farm-out arrangement with Holloman to drill three wells retaining a 13.8325% Carried Working Interest. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Holloman drilled the Pecos #1 well on PEL 112 being the first of the three well programs. The Pecos #1 was completed as a Dry Hole. During 2008 Holloman obtained approval from the South Australian Government for new exploration terms giving a new five-year work program for PEL 112 and consolidating PEL 108 & 109 to a new Exploration Permit PEL 444. The Company’s terms and conditions mentioned above are subject to change on these two permits as Holloman is seeking a joint venture partner to expand the work program. For further information on activities on the Company’s properties see "Item 2. Properties".   A 12” pipeline was constructed to the Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009 on VIC/P54. Revenues from gas sales for the Company begin during the first half of 2010. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet.   ACOR has Overriding Royalty Interests under 10,766,240 gross surface acres in the Cooper/Eromanga and Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin plus has working interests under 6,507,224 gross surface acres. For additional information regarding these concessions including those mentioned above in this section see "Item 2. Properties".             The Company’s management is optimistic about the future drilling planned on its Australian interests, especially for the next couple of years.   Results of Operations   The Company's oil and gas revenues increased approximately 62% when comparing 2010 to 2011. In 2010 the revenues were $77,652 compared to $125,726 in 2011. The majority of these revenues came from the Company’s ownership in ATP 299 and ATP 267, oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland, Australia, and VIC/P54 located in the Bass Strait of Gippsland Basin of Victoria, Australia.   The categories of Personnel Costs, Professional fees and Promotion and advertising reported expenditures of $144,840 for 2010 compared to $258,345 for 2011. Of the $144,840 the Company paid $10,000 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2010 and of the $258,345 the Company paid $179,778 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2011. The unregistered shares were issued for those services based on the closing stock price at the time of issuance without any discount for their lack of liquidity. The basic allocation of the 2010 Personnel Cost of $58,055 was $39,317 for contract services, $17,141 in wages and $1,600 for officer compensation. The allocation of the 2011 Personnel Cost of $149,432 was $105,494 for contract services, $22,184 in wages, $21,600 for officer compensation and $154 for miscellaneous fees. The Directors’ fees and other operating expense category for 2010 was $5,885 increasing to $52,506 for 2011. No Directors’ fees were awarded in 2010.   The other categories of expenditures did not significantly change when comparing the fiscal year ended 2010 to 2011.   Other Income (Expense) for the Company includes interest expense of $2,353 for 2010 compared to an interest expense of $5,149 for 2011.   Australian income taxes increased from $10,026 in 2010 to $17,925 for 2011, which is directly related to the increase in revenues.   The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $147,311 compared to a net loss of $262,283 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Per share losses were $0.01 per share for the year ended 2010 and $0.01 per share for 2011.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company's Total Current Assets as of December 31, 2010 were $31,337 compared to $56,948 on December 31, 2011. The increase in current assets is due to the increase in cash on hand. The Company’s receivables are due from oil and gas sales earned during the year but were not received on or before the end of the reporting year.   The Total Current Liabilities as of December 31, 2010 were $217,211 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 0.14 to 1. The Total Current Liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $343,564 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 0.17 to 1. The slight improvement in liquidity ratio from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to more current assets as of December 31, 2011.   The Company plans to meet its operating expenditures from a private placement of its restricted common stock. The Company is seeking exploration partners on its various oil and gas concessions located in Australia.   Total assets of the Company increased from $988,302 on December 31, 2010 to $1,227,350 on December 31, 2011, an increase of $239,048.  The Company Net Property and Equipment increased from $955,881 in 2010 to $961,727.  This increase of $5,846 was attributed to the capital expenditures made on ATP 582, an Australian oil and gas concession. The increase in assets is due to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper/Eromanga Inc., placing an environmental bond for ATP 582 of $207,591 shown in the financial statements as restricted cash under Other Assets.             Total Current Liabilities of the Company increased from $217,211 on December 31, 2011 to $343,564 on December 31, 2011. This increase is due to loans from shareholders of the Company for the environmental bond mentioned above for ATP 582.   The accrued expenses of $115,486 and $41,655 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 respectively were for consulting fees and director’s fees. The $115,486 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2010 is allocated $2,903 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued director’s fees and $76,983 for consulting fees. The $41,655 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2011 is allocated $5,298 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued director’s fees and $757for other fees.   Plan of Operation and Funding   The Company plans to seek additional oil and gas concessions in Australia on a ground level basis and will seek partners to join in this process. The Company has been successful in entering into farm-out arrangements to defer the exploration commitments on six Australian concessions to joint venture partners and has confidence of being able to repeat this process in the event the Company is successful in acquiring other concessions in Australia.   Material Commitments   The Company has material financial commitments on several of its working interest properties located in Australia. Concessions PEL 112, 444 and ATP 582 have expenditure requirements that may exceed the Company’s Carried Working Interest in each of these concessions. See "Item 2. Properties" for additional information.   Purchase of Significant Equipment   The Company does not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.   Subsequent Events:   The Company has acquired a 100% Working Interest in PL 18 and PL 40, and a 50% Working Interest in PL 280, located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland Australia. This basin was home to the first oil discovery in Australia, and is currently the focus of significant coal-seam gas exploration and production activity by others.   The assets acquired by the Company include 5 oilfields: Yellowbank Creek, Thomby Creek, Louise, McWhirter, Narrows and Beardmore. These fields were developed in the 1970's and 1980's, and have collectively produced approximately 7-10% of the estimated oil originally in place ("OOIP"). The Company believes that up to 50% of the OOIP is potentially recoverable through the application of well-established enhanced recovery techniques including downspacing, horizontal drilling, and reservoir pressure maintenance through waterflooding.   In 2007, the vendors of the Surat assets (the "Vendors") obtained an independent resource report by CDS Data Services Pty Ltd. ("CDS Report") to assess the remaining recoverable oil resources in the 5 fields. The CDS Report provided a range of 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to 6.7 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil resources. Since 2007, there has been no significant investment in the fields as the Vendors were unsuccessful in securing the necessary capital to develop the remaining oil resources. The fields were recently producing 4 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of high quality 51 degree oil, which is sold at a premium of approximately US$8.50 above Brent crude oil price, or a premium of approximately US$24.00 above West Texas Intermediate crude oil price.   The Company currently has 50,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 49,960,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has agreed to hold an annual and special meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable, in order to, among other things, amend the authorized share capital of the Company to provide for an unlimited number of shares of common stock. Upon such amendments taking effect and in accordance with the terms of the share exchange agreement dated November 17, 2011 (the "Share Exchange Agreement") among ACOR, 1629518 Alberta Ltd. and certain other parties thereto, the Company will issue an additional 69,065 shares of the Company to Bill Petrie Sr, Bill Petrie, Jr, and Jesse Meidl, along with the issuance of 5,000,000 Share Purchase Warrants of ACOR (the "Warrants") to certain persons in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The Warrants will have a strike price of US$0.25 per share, and will only vest if the Company trades at a price above US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days, with a total of 100,000 Company shares trading during the 10 day period, and expire 24 months after the date of issuance.             The Company has agreed to pay the Vendors US$3.0 million within 12 months of the closing of the Acquisition (the "Deferred Consideration"). The Vendors have secured a first lien over PL 18, PL 40, and PL 280. The Company intends to secure a reserve based lending facility to refinance the Deferred Consideration, which does not accrue interest or other charges within 12 months of closing.   The Board of the Company are pleased to add two experienced oil industry executives: William Petrie Sr. and Jesse Meidl.   Mr. Petrie has in excess of 35 years' experience as a petroleum geologist, primarily in Western Canada. He began his career with Mobil Oil, leaving after several years to join the independent sector. He has been involved as President and Director for a number of public and private oil and gas companies. In these positions he was responsible for generating, evaluating, and successfully exploiting oil and gas exploration, development, and acquisition opportunities throughout North America.   Mr. Meidl has over 15 years of experience in the oil and gas sector. He is Chief Financial Officer of a private international energy company, headquartered in London, England. Prior thereto, he was an investment banker in the International Oil & Gas group of Thomas Weisel Partners in London (Now Stifel Nicolas). Mr. Meidl was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Arsenal Energy Inc., an international exploration company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which held production assets in Canada and the USA and exploration assets in Egypt, Colombia and Uzbekistan. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG in Calgary, where he specialized in oil and gas exploration and production and services. He also holds the ICAEW Corporate Finance qualification and a B. Comm. degree from the University of Saskatchewan (Canada).   It is planned that during the second quarter of 2012, the Company will be undertaking a workover program of certain wells on PL 40 and PL 280 which will reactivate two old wells at a cost of A$400,000. The workover program is anticipated to bring total field production to approximately 25 barrels of oil per day.   The Company will also be obtaining an updated reserve and resource report over all of the assets in the Company's portfolio, including the Surat basin assets and ATP 582. It is anticipated the report will be finalized in the second quarter of 2012.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   The FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The codification has changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP guidance is referenced, but did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” This ASU requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company will comply with the additional disclosures required by this guidance upon its adoption in January 2010.             Also in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas—Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.”  This ASU amends the “Extractive Industries—Oil and Gas” Topic of the Codification to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements in this Topic with the SEC’s Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” discussed below.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009, and the adoption of these provisions on December 31, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial statements.   SEC’s Final Rule on Oil and Gas Disclosure Requirements    On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” which revises the disclosures required by oil and gas companies.  The SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas companies have been updated to include expanded disclosure for oil and gas activities, and certain definitions have also been changed that will impact the determination of oil and gas reserve quantities.  The provisions of this final rule are effective for registration statements filed on or after January 1, 2010, and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009   In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” related to fair value measurement of liabilities. This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more valuation techniques. This guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance.   In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This guidance established a new hierarchy of GAAP sources for non-governmental entities under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Codification is the sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, except for those issued by the SEC. The guidance was effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations .   In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 855 “Subsequent Events,” which sets forth: (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and (3) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009.   In April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” related to estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations.   Also in April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.             The FASB updated its guidance under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in April 2009, which addresses application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance was effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual period on or after December 15, 2008.   In June 2008, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” This guidance clarified that all unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities and provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share using the two-class method. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations.   In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related items affect an entity’s financial position, operations and cash flows. This guidance was effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009 .   Accounting For Natural Gas and Oil Producing Activities   We use the full cost method to account for our natural gas and oil producing activities. Under this accounting method, we capitalize substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development, and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves in full cost pools maintained by geographic areas, regardless of whether reserves are actually discovered and apply a quarterly full cost ceiling test. Adverse changes in conditions (primarily gas price declines) could result in permanent write-downs in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as well as non-cash charges to operations, but would not affect cash flows.   Property, Equipment and Depreciation   We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the acquisition of methane, petroleum, and natural gas interests are capitalized. Under this method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs, annual carrying charges of non-producing properties, geological and geophysical costs, costs of drilling and equipping productive and non-productive wells, and direct exploration salaries and related benefits. Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas properties are recorded as a reduction of the related capitalized costs without recognition of a gain or loss unless the disposal would result in a change of 20 percent or more in the depletion rate.   Depreciation and depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units-of-production method based upon estimates of proved reserves, as determined by independent consultants, with oil and gas being converted to a common unit of measure based on their relative energy content.   The costs of acquisition and exploration of unproved oil and gas properties, including any related capitalized interest expense, are not subject to depletion, but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis. The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage are also not subject to depletion. Costs not subject to depletion are periodically assessed for possible impairment or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs subject to depletion are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those operations where a reserve base is not yet established .   Estimated future removal and site restoration costs are provided over the life of proven reserves on units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards. The charge is included in the provision for depletion and depreciation and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred.             We apply a ceiling test to capitalized costs which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value, using a ten percent discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from production of proven reserves at year end at market prices less future production, administrative, financing, site restoration, and income tax costs plus the lower of cost or estimated market value of unproved properties. If capitalized costs are determined to exceed estimated future net revenues, a write-down of carrying value is charged to depletion in the period.   ITEM 7A.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the two years then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements.  You are also urged to consider the information under the caption "Summary of Critical Accounting Policies." Summary We are the world's largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft-related items.  Our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores.  We have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices.  The key to our success is our ability to grow our base business.  We grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations.  We intend to continue to expand both domestically and internationally. We operate in three segments.  First, Wholesale Leathercraft, consisting of our Leather Factory stores and our national account sales group, which sells to large national store chains, is our oldest segment with sales of $26.5 million in 2011.  Historically, in normal economic conditions, this division has generally offered steady but very modest increases in sales.  Sales in 2011 increased 2.4% compared to 2010.  Compared to 2010, the wholesale stores’ sales increased 2.3% and national account sales were up 3.9%.  Sales at our stores are showing signs of recovery despite cautious consumer spending as a result of the weak U.S. economy.  Sales to national accounts tend to be less consistent. Since acquiring its assets in 2000, Tandy Leather has been re-established as the operator of retail leathercraft stores.  (Prior to our acquisition in 2000, all of the Tandy Leather retail stores had been closed.)  These retail stores comprise our Retail Leathercraft segment. This segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales ($37.4 million in 2011, up from $32.3 million in 2010) and is our largest source of revenues.  We expect to grow the number of stores to 100+ from 77 stores in operation at the end of 2011.  Our pace of store openings has slowed in the last several years due to the general economic conditions in the U.S. and because of the lack of personnel qualified for store manager positions.  We expect to continue to open stores domestically but have not committed to a specific time frame at this point.  While the store opening schedule has slowed, we are generally attempting to relocate existing stores as the leases come up for renewal into larger spaces so that a larger amount of product is available to customers.  We believe that the increase in sales in this segment suggests that the store relocation strategy is successful. Our International Leathercraft segment consists of company-owned stores located outside of North America.  At December 31, 2011, two combination retail/wholesale stores, with one located in the United Kingdom and the other located in Australia, comprised this segment.  In January 2012, we opened a store in Spain, bringing the number of stores in this segment to three.  It is our intention to open more stores in this segment once we have a large enough customer base to support additional stores. On a consolidated basis, a key indicator of costs, gross margin as a percent of total net sales, increased in 2010 and in 2011.  Operating expenses increased at a slightly slower pace than that of sales, increasing 10% between 2010 and 2011 and 8% between 2009 and 2010. We reported consolidated net income for 2011 of $4.7 million.  Consolidated net income for 2010 and 2009 was $4.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively.  We use our cash flow to fund our operations, to fund the opening of new stores, to purchase necessary property and equipment and to make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market.  In 2007, we incurred $4.0 million in bank debt to purchase a 191,000 square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units.  We moved into that facility in the first quarter of 2008.  In 2010, we paid a one-time dividend to our stockholders, totaling $7.7 million.  At the end of 2011, our stockholders’ equity had increased to $34.4 million from $29.8 million the previous year. Comparing the December 31, 2011 balance sheet with the prior year’s balance sheet, we decreased our investment in inventory from $20.2 million to $19.9 million, while total cash (including certificates of deposit) increased from $5.9 million to $11.2 million.        10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net Sales Net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company Incr from Prior Year 2011 $26,540,899 $37,435,832 $2,126,216 $66,102,947 10.4% 2010 $25,908,177 $32,291,442 $1,693,251 $59,892,870 9.9% 2009 $25,095,392 $28,079,863 $1,307,484 $54,482,739 3.8% Our net sales increased by 10.4% in 2011 when compared with 2010 and increased by 9.9% in 2010 when compared with 2009.  In 2011 and 2010, all three segments reported sales increases compared to the prior year. Costs and Expenses In general, our gross profit as a percentage of sales (our gross margin) fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve, the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally.  Our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on-going process, and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors.  Sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels.  Therefore, as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix, higher gross margins tend to follow.  Finally, there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer.  As a result, our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period. For 2011, our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to 2010, resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from 60.5% to 61.0%.  Our 2010 cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to 2009, resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from 59.9% to 60.5%.  Fluctuations in gross margin are primarily due to sales mix.  Retail sales are at a higher gross margin than that of wholesale sales.  Therefore, as retail sales increase at a faster pace than that of wholesale sales, gross margin increases accordingly. Our gross margins for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company 2011 61.3% 60.5% 66.9% 61.0% 2010 60.7% 60.2% 63.8% 60.5% 2009 58.5% 60.9% 63.6% 59.9% Our operating expenses decreased minimally as a percentage of total net sales to 49.4% in 2011 when compared with 49.5% in 2010.  This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew slightly slower than our sales during this period.  2011 operating expenses were $3.0 million higher than those of 2010.  Significant expense fluctuations in 2011 compared to 2010 are as follows: Expense                  2011 amount Incr (Decr) over 2010 Employee compensation & benefits $18.0 million $2.1 million Travel expense 330,000 (50,000) Credit card fees 910,000 100,000 Rent & utilities 4.0 million 190,000 Professional fees and licenses 1.4 million 600,000 Freight out – shipping product to customers 1.7 million 120,000 The increase in employee compensation and benefits is due primarily to the increase in store manager compensation. Our store managers are paid a percentage of the operating profit generated by the store they manage as additional compensation, so as store profits increase, manager compensation increases.  Also included in benefits is our employee health benefit plan which has seen consistent cost increases compared to prior years. Our operating expenses decreased 1.0% as a percentage of total net sales to 49.5% in 2010 when compared with 50.5% in 2009.  This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew more slowly than our sales during this period.  2010 operating expenses were $2.1 million higher than those of 2009.  Significant expense fluctuations in 2010 compared to 2009 are as follows: Expense                  2010 amount Incr (Decr) over 2009 Employee compensation & benefits $15.9 million $1.4 million Travel expense 380,000 180,000 Credit card fees 820,000 130,000 Rent & utilities 3.7 million 300,000 Professional fees and licenses 800,000 100,000 Freight out – shipping product to customers 1.6 million 270,000 Loss on disposal of equipment 50,000 (300,000) Other Income/Expense (net) Other Income/Expense consists primarily of currency exchange fluctuations, interest income and interest expense.  In 2011, we had other expense (net) of $165,000 compared to other expense (net) of $160,000 in 2010.  We received $16,000 in gas royalties.  We earned $34,000 in interest income on our cash and paid $248,000 in interest expense on our bank debt.  We had a currency exchange loss of $200 in 2011 compared to $187,000 in 2010. In 2010, we had other expense (net) of $160,000 compared to other expense (net) of $134,000 in 2009.  We received $38,000 in gas royalties.  We earned $73,000 in interest income on our cash and paid $265,000 in interest expense on our bank debt.  We had a currency exchange loss of $187,000 in 2010 compared to $98,000 in 2009. Net Income During 2011, we earned net income of $4.7 million, a 14% increase over our net income of $4.2 million earned during 2010.  The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses and income tax expense. During 2010, we earned net income of $4.2 million, a 25% increase over our net income of $3.3 million earned during 2009.  The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.    11 TABLE OF CONTENTS Wholesale Leathercraft The increases (or decreases) in net sales, operating income, operating income increases (or decreases) and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Wholesale Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:   Year Net Sales Incr (Decr)    from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income  Incr (Decr) from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales 2011 2.4% $2,803,034 4.2% 10.6% 2010 3.2% $2,690,061 33.3% 10.4% 2009 (5.3)% $2,017,915 13.2% 8.0% Wholesale Leathercraft, consisting of our 29 wholesale stores and our national account group, accounted for 40.2% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, which compares to 43.3% in 2010 and 45.6% in 2009.  The decrease in this division's contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in Retail Leathercraft, and we expect this trend to continue while retail consumers’ buying patterns continue to strengthen over that of wholesale and small businesses. Sales in the wholesale stores increased 2.2% in 2011 compared to sales in 2010 while the sales increase in our national account group was 3.9% from 2010 to 2011.  By customer group, we increased sales in the wholesale stores significantly to our retail customers while sales to our wholesale and national account customers remained consistent with 2010.  The most significant decreases were in our institution and manufacturer groups which have been significantly affected by the weakness in the U.S. economy.  Our sales mix by customer group in the Wholesale Leathercraft division was as follows: Customer Group 2011 2010 2009 Retail 33% 31% 29% Institution 5% 6% 7% Wholesale 43% 43% 42% National Accounts 12% 12% 15% Manufacturers 7% 8% 7%    100% 100% 100% In 2011, operating income as a percentage of divisional sales remained consistent with the prior year at 10.5%.  Significant operating expense increases occurred in employee compensation ($325,000), employee benefits ($490,000), and supplies ($73,000), offset somewhat by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses ($353,000) and bad debt expenses ($130,000). The 2010 increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease in operating expenses of $200,000.  Significant operating expense decreases occurred in loss on disposal of equipment ($325,000), depreciation ($35,000) and bad debts ($75,000), offset somewhat by increases in employee compensation ($200,000) and travel expenses ($50,000). Retail Leathercraft The increases in net sales, operating income, operating income increases (or decreases) and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Retail Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows:   Year Net Sales Increase from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income Incr (Decr) from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of  Sales 2011 15.9% $4,656,067 28.8% 12.4% 2010 15.0% $3,614,856 24.6% 11.2% 2009 11.3% $2,900,701 32.6% 10.3% Reflecting the growth previously discussed, Retail Leathercraft accounted for 56.6% of our total net sales in 2011, up from 53.9% in 2010 and 51.1% in 2009.  Growth in net sales for our Retail Leathercraft division in 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in same store sales. Our sales mix by customer group in the Retail Leathercraft division was as follows: Customer Group 2011 2010 2009 Retail 62% 64% 65% Institution 5% 6% 7% Wholesale 30% 29% 27% National Accounts 0% 0% 0% Manufacturers 3% 1% 1%    100% 100% 100% Operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 12.4% for 2011 compared to 11.2% for 2010.  Gross margin increased slightly to 60.5% in 2011 from 60.2% in 2010.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales in 2011 decreased from 49.0% for 2010 to 48.0% for 2011 as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than that of sales. Operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 11.2% for 2010 compared to 10.3% for 2009.  Gross margin decreased slightly to 60.2% in 2010 from 60.9% in 2009.  Operating expenses as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 1.6%, from 50.6% for 2009 to 49.0% for 2010 as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than that of sales. We intend to continue the expansion of Tandy Leather’s retail store chain over the next several years, with plans to open at least one store in 2012 in North America.  We remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability.  In the current economic environment in the U.S., it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in 2012 if we determine that feasibility of additional successful openings is likely. International Leathercraft International Leathercraft consists of all stores located outside of North America.  As of December 31, 2011, that represents two retail/wholesale combination stores with one located in the United Kingdom and the other in Australia.  A third store was opened in January 2012, located in Spain.  International Leathercraft accounted for 3.2%, 2.8% and 2.4% of our total sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Operating income was $248,000, $331,000 and $176,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We expect this segment to become a larger part of our total operations as our international customer base continues to grow. We intend to expand our International Leathercraft segment by opening one to two new stores in 2012.  We opened a store in Spain in January 2012 and anticipate another store opening in the last half of the year.  The number and timing of store openings will be subject to compliance with all local legal requirements, lease negotiations and execution and completion of the finish out of the stores.    12 TABLE OF CONTENTS   Financial Condition   At December 31, 2011, we held $11.2 million of cash and certificates of deposit, $19.9 million of inventory, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and $10.3 million of property and equipment.  Goodwill and other intangibles (net of amortization and depreciation) were $987,000 and $187,000, respectively.  Net total assets were $45.5 million.  Current liabilities were $7.1 million (including $203,000 of current maturities of long-term debt), while long-term debt was $3.1 million.  Total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2011 was $34.4 million. At December 31, 2010, we held $5.9 million of cash and certificates of deposit, $20.2 million of inventory, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and $10.3 million of property and equipment.  Goodwill and other intangibles (net of amortization and depreciation) were $990,000 and $232,000, respectively.  Net total assets were $40.6 million.  Current liabilities were $6.9 million (including $203,000 of current maturities of long-term debt), while long-term debt was $3.3 million.  Total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2010 was $29.8 million. Specific ratios on a consolidated basis at the end of each year ended December 31 were as follows:       2011 2010 2009 Solvency Ratios:             Quick Ratio (Cash+Accts Rec)/Total Current Liabilities 1.76 1.04 2.44 Current Ratio Total Current Assets/Total Current Liabilities 4.74 4.17 5.55 Current Liabilities to Net Worth Total Current Liabilities/Net Worth 0.21 0.23 0.17 Current Liabilities to Inventory Total Current Liabilities/Inventory 0.36 0.34 0.34 Total Liabilities to Net Worth Total Liabilities/Net Worth 0.32 0.36 0.30 Fixed Assets to Net Worth Fixed Assets/Net Worth 0.30 0.35 0.29                Efficiency Ratios:             Collection Period (Days Outstanding) Accounts Receivable/Credit Sales x 365 42.35 39.83 37.22 Inventory Turnover Sales/Average Inventory 3.29 3.23 3.35 Assets to Sales Total Assets/Sales 0.69 0.68 0.79 Sales to Net Working Capital Sales/Current Assets - Current Liabilities 2.49 2.74 2.09 Accounts Payable to Sales Accounts Payable/Sales 0.03 0.02 0.02                Profitability Ratios:             Return on Sales (Profit Margin) Net Profit After Taxes/Sales 0.07 0.07 0.06 Return on Assets Net Profit After Taxes/Total Assets 0.10 0.10 0.08 Return on Net Worth (Return on Equity) Net Profit After Taxes/Net Worth 0.14 0.14 0.10 Capital Resources and Liquidity On July 31, 2007, we entered into a Credit Agreement and Line of Credit Note with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit facility of up to $5,500,000 to facilitate our purchase and remodel of real estate consisting of a 191,000 square foot building situated on 30 acres of land located at 1900 SE Loop 820 in Fort Worth, Texas.  Proceeds in the amount of $4,050,000 were used to fund the initial purchase of the property.  On April 30, 2008, that amount was rolled into a ten-year term note, and we began making monthly debt service payments in May 2008. We are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the JPMorgan Chase Credit Agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements.  The principal terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are described in further detail in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt. Reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness as well as dividend payments during the periods, our financing activities for 2011, 2010 and 2009 required net cash of $0.2 million, $8.2 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.  The one-time, special dividend paid in July 2010 of $7.7 million is the reason for the significant increase in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2011 and 2009. Our primary source of liquidity and capital resources during 2011 was cash flow provided by operating activities.  Net cash flow from operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $6.6 million, $2.7 million, and $5.3 million, respectively.  The decrease in operating cash flow in 2010 was due to the increase in inventory in the last half of 2010.  In 2011, cash flow from operations was generated from income, the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in accrued expenses.  In 2010 and 2009, cash flow from operations was generated from income, partially offset by the increase in inventory. Consolidated accounts receivable increased $75,000 to $1.3 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2010.  Average days to collect accounts increased from 40 days in 2010 to 42 days in 2011 on a consolidated basis.  We maintain a tight credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectability.  We believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses, and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses. Inventory decreased from $20.2 million at the end of 2010 to $19.9 million at December 31, 2011.  We are pleased with the slight reduction in our inventory investment at December 31, 2011.  However, as we continue our store expansion and relocation, we expect our inventory to increase.  Further, continued sales increases are partially dependent on product availability in our stores.  We will continue to look for large purchasing opportunities of product at aggressive pricing in order to support our gross margin goals.  We attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected expansion.  We ended the year with our total inventory on hand approximately 10% below our internal targets for optimal inventory. Consolidated inventory turned 3.29 times during 2011, a slight improvement from the 2010 turns at 3.23 times.  We compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory. By operating division, inventory turns are as follows: Segment 2011 2010 2009 Wholesale Leathercraft 1.95 1.96 2.18 Retail Leathercraft 6.41 6.45 6.13 International Leathercraft 6.91 5.65 3.95             Wholesale Leathercraft stores only 6.68 7.40 6.82 Retail Leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of Wholesale Leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores.  The retail stores have no warehouse (backstock) inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse.  Wholesale Leathercraft’s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division, and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores. Accounts payable totaled $1.6 million at the end of 2011, up from $1.2 million at the end of 2010.      13 TABLE OF CONTENTS As discussed above, the largest use of operating cash in 2011 was the decrease in accrued expenses, specifically the decrease in the amount of inventory in transit.  Cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the primary capital expenditure was store fixtures, either for new stores or for relocated or remodeled stores.  Fixtures and equipment for the new international stores totaled $225,000.  We moved or remodeled 14 stores in the US in 2011.  Fixtures for those stores totaled $310,000.  Fixtures for the new U.S. store opened in 2011 totaled $15,000.  Other capital expenditures were building improvements, including a video surveillance system ($112,000), computer equipment ($240,000), website development ($70,000) and factory machines and dies ($35,000).  In 2010, the primary capital expenditure was the construction of a building to be used for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the staging of drop-shipments of specially purchased product to our stores ($950,000).  Other capital expenditures were building improvements, including a generator ($110,000), store fixtures ($153,000), computer equipment ($200,000), and factory machines and dies ($62,000).  We intend to open one to two stores in the U.S. and one to two stores abroad in 2012, having already opened one store in Spain in January 2012, and therefore we expect to incur some capital expenditures related to these store openings,  In addition, we intend to continue to relocate US stores into larger space as leases permit and therefore, expect to incur capital expenditures, namely fixtures, related to these moves.  Therefore, we expect our 2012 capital expenditures to be comparable to that of our 2011 expenditures. Cash applied toward stock repurchases totaled $441,419 and $1,624,264 in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  There were no stock repurchases in 2011. We believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in 2012, while also funding our expansion plans.  At this time, we know of no trends or demands, commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity, capital resources or results of operations.  In addition, we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments.  We could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow.  In particular, because of the relatively small investment required by each new store, we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during 2011, 2010 and 2009, and we do not currently have any such arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 (not including related interest expense):    Payments Due by Periods   Contractual Obligations   Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 -5 Years More than 5 Years Long-Term Debt(1) $3,307,500 $202,500 $405,000 $405,000 $2,295,000 Operating Leases(2) 7,448,982 2,738,498 3,319,822 1,379,600 11,062 Total Contractual Obligations $10,756,482 $2,940,998 $3,724,822 $1,784,600 $2,306,062 ____________________ (1)  Our loan from JPMorgan Chase matures in May 2018. (2)  These are our leased facilities. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies We strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.  We follow generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. in preparing our consolidated financial statements.  These principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations.  We continually review our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Basis of Consolidation.   We report our financial information on a consolidated basis.  Therefore, unless there is an indication to the contrary, financial information is provided for the parent company, Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., and its subsidiaries as a whole.  Transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose.  We own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated.  None of our subsidiaries are “off balance sheet.” Revenue Recognition.   We recognize revenue for retail (over the counter) sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products, provided that there are no significant post-delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured, which generally occurs upon shipment.  Net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances, product returns, and allowances for defective merchandise. Allowance for Accounts Receivable.   We reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future.  This allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer's financial condition, past collection history, and the aging of the account.  If the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory.   Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the “first in, first out” method.  This means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold.  In addition, we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow-moving or obsolete inventory.  This reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand.  If actual future demand is less favorable than what we project, additional write-downs may be necessary.  Goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier. Goodwill.   We periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carrying value.  As of December 31, 2011, we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the operating divisions associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances.  If actual financial performance of these divisions differs significantly from our projections, such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the SEC, or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us, other than statements of historical fact, are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Words such as “may,” “assume,” “forecast,” “position,” “predict,” “strategy,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “project,” “budget,” “potential,” or “continue,” and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. They can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed. Actual results may vary materially. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.  We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.    14 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We face exposure to financial market risks, including adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.  These exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results.  We do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our foreign subsidiaries as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses.   Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of revenue and expenses.  See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information , for financial information concerning our foreign activities. Interest Rate Risk In the past, we have been subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt.  However, our current credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase includes a fixed interest rate.  Therefore, changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area.    15 TABLE OF CONTENTS 		</c>

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Overview Since our inception in 1992, we have been primarily engaged in developing and operating gaming establishments and related lodging, restaurant and entertainment facilities. Our primary source of revenue is from the net proceeds of our gaming machines and tables, with ancillary revenue generated from hotel, restaurant, bowling and entertainment facilities that are a part of the casinos. We currently own, operate and manage the following casinos through wholly-owned subsidiaries: ● The Century Casino & Hotel in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; ● The Century Casino Calgary, Alberta, Canada; ● The Century Casino & Hotel in Central City, Colorado; and ● The Century Casino & Hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado.   We also operate 12 ship-based casinos onboard four cruise lines; Oceania Cruises, TUI Cruises, Windstar Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. The most recent ship-based casino additions include the Marina, which began operating in January 2011 with Oceania Cruises and the Mein Schiff 2, which began operating in May 2011 with TUI Cruises.      - 26 -      The following table summarizes the cruise lines for which we have entered into agreements and are currently operating ship-based casinos and the associated ships on which we operate ship-based casinos:     Cruise Line Ship Oceania Cruises Regatta Oceania Cruises Nautica Oceania Cruises Insignia Oceania Cruises Marina TUI Cruises Mein Schiff 1 TUI Cruises Mein Schiff 2 Windstar Cruises Wind Surf Windstar Cruises Wind Star Windstar Cruises Wind Spirit Regent Seven Seas Cruises Seven Seas Voyager Regent Seven Seas Cruises Seven Seas Mariner Regent Seven Seas Cruises Seven Seas Navigator We also hold a 33.3% ownership interest in and actively participate in the management of CPL, the owner and operator of four casinos throughout Poland. We account for this investment under the equity method. Until December 2011, CPL was the owner and operator of seven casinos in Poland. However, in March 2011, following a change of ownership of the landlord at the Krakow casino, CPL was informed that the lease agreement at the Krakow casino would expire on December 31, 2011 and would not be renewed. The Krakow casino license expired in December 2011 and was not renewed, although a license was obtained for a new casino in Krakow. Further, in November 2011, the gaming license used to operate the Marriott casino in Warsaw expired. At the time, CPL operated both the Hyatt casino and the Marriott casino in Warsaw. Because CPL management believed that the Marriott casino in Warsaw was more profitable than the Hyatt casino, CPL chose to use the license from the Hyatt casino to continue operating the Marriott casino and ceased operations at the Hyatt casino as permitted by Polish gaming authorities.    - 27 -    In December 2011, the license for the Posnan casino expired and was not renewed. CPL has obtained four additional gaming licenses in the cities of Sosnowiec, Plock, Lodz and Krakow in Poland. Casinos in these cities are scheduled to open in 2012. In addition, CPL is participating in several other license applications including in Posnan and Warsaw. Decisions from the Polish Minister of Finance on these applications are still pending. In December 2010, we entered into a long-term management agreement to direct the operation of the casino at the Radisson Aruba Resort, Casino & Spa. We receive a management fee consisting of a fixed fee, plus a percentage of the casino’s EBITDA. We were not required to invest any amounts under the management agreement. We recognize in our statement of earnings foreign currency transaction gains or losses resulting from the translation of casino operations and other transactions that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars. Our casinos in Canada represent a significant portion of our business, and the revenue generated and expenses incurred by these operations are generally denominated in Canadian dollars. A decrease in the value of this currency in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar would decrease the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars, and an increase in the value of this currency in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar would increase the earnings from our foreign operations when translated into U.S. dollars.  For example, we experienced an increase in earnings that was partially due to an increase in the average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar of 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. See Note 2 "Significant Accounting Policies - Foreign Currency Translation" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

The increase is due to increased customer volumes during the first and second quarters of 2011 compared to the first and second quarters of 2010 and the addition of 16 slot machines to the floor during the third quarter of 2011. The increase in gaming revenue is also due to an increase in the average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar of 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 (the “4% exchange rate increase”). In Canadian dollars, gaming revenue increased by 6.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.   Hotel, food, beverage and other revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increases in hotel, food, beverage and other revenue are due to increased food and beverage revenue from the Yuk Yuk’s Comedy Club, which we began operating without a third party provider in September 2010, and increased showroom events attendance. The increase in hotel, food, beverage and other revenue is also the result of the 4.0% exchange rate increase. In Canadian dollars, hotel, food, beverage and other revenue increased by 4.5%. Promotional allowances increased by $0.2 million, or 33.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is partially due to increased participation in our players’ club loyalty program and increased use of complimentary services provided to customers. The increase is also due to the 4.0% exchange rate increase. Total operating costs and expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 6.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is primarily due to the 4.0% exchange rate increase. In Canadian dollars, total operating costs and expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 2.2%. The increase is also due to increased marketing costs related to showroom entertainment costs and increased marketing expenses.    - 31 -    Earnings from operations increased by $1.0 million, or 18.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.

Gaming revenue at our property in Calgary increased by $1.1 million, or 20.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due to new and converted slot machines added to the floor, improved slot machine floor layout and increased customer volumes in 2011.

Bowling, food, beverage and other revenue increased by $1.1 million, or 36.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in food, beverage and other revenue is due to the differing types of events and increased attendance at events offered in the property’s showrooms, increased food quality at each restaurant and bar, additional customer volumes in the casino and improved customer service. The increase in bowling revenue is due to the new bowling lanes and bowling leagues that utilize our facility. The increases in bowling, food, beverage and other revenue is also the result of the 4.0% exchange rate increase. In Canadian dollars, bowling, food, beverage and other revenue increased by $1.0 million, or 31.4%. Promotional allowances increased by $0.1 million, or 28.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due to the addition of a players’ club point redemption program during the year. The increase is also due to the 4.0% exchange rate increase. In Canadian dollars, promotional allowances increased by $0.1 million, or 23.3%.    - 32 -    Total operating costs and expenses increased by $1.8 million, or 21.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase is due to increased radio advertising, promotional prizes and events, increased loyalty membership direct mailing costs and additional staffing costs in order to provide improved customer service. The increase is also due to the 4.0% exchange rate increase. In Canadian dollars, total operating costs increased by $1.5 million, or 16.6%. Losses from operations decreased by $0.3 million, or 65.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. In Canadian dollars, losses from operations decreased by $0.3 million, or 67.7%. During December 31, 2011, management of the casino continued to look at new ways to market the casino and utilize the showrooms and bowling alley to attract customers while maintaining costs.

The increase is due to increased table games revenue generated from craps and player banked poker, increased customer volumes that we believe resulted from the disruption at the Fortune Valley Casino in Central City during the transition of its ownership during the first and second quarters of 2011 and increased revenue from slot machines that were moved from the lower level to the main level of the casino. Also, the Central City market increased by 3% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increased market led to higher business volumes compared to 2010. Hotel, food and beverage revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due to increased prime rib sales and beverage portion control. In addition, the deli was closed for remodeling during the fourth quarter of 2010.    - 33 -    Promotional allowances increased by $0.4 million, or 10.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in promotional allowance expense is primarily due to a more aggressive player point redemption program offered during the third and fourth quarters of 2011. Total operating costs and expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due to increased marketing costs for promotional prizes and giveaways, player participation in bus ridership rewards in which the casino reimburses a portion of players’ bus fare to the casino, increased gaming taxes as a result of higher gaming revenue, increased game royalty fees and increased staffing costs in order to provide better customer service. Earnings from operations increased by $0.3 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, the property continued its emphasis on restructuring and efficiencies of operations to reduce costs and improve revenue. In addition, the property is maximizing marketing strategies to compete in a very competitive Central City/Black Hawk market. Our competitors continue to develop VIP programs in direct competition to ours. In response, we are seeking to develop programs that offer better rewards.

The increase is due to higher slot revenue from new slot machines, additional table games revenue generated after moving the table games pit from the back of the casino to the front, improved customer service and targeted and higher frequency marketing strategies improving the customer volumes and differentiating our casino from competitors. Finally, we believe slot gaming revenue also improved partly due to a disruption in operations at the J.P. McGills casino in Cripple Creek during a remodeling project that took place during the first quarter of 2011.   Total operating costs and expenses increases by $1.0 million, or 10.4%. The increase in total operating costs and expenses is due to increased marketing costs for more aggressive marketing campaigns including promotional prizes and increased direct mail costs, increased slot machine royalty fees in order to provide the latest slot machine products, increased gaming taxes as a result of higher gaming revenue, increased staffing costs in order to provide greater customer service and increased utility costs from colder temperatures during the first quarter of 2011.    - 34 -    Earnings from operations increased by $0.9 million, or 206.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, the property continued its emphasis on controlling expenses while still maintaining aggressive marketing campaigns, providing the latest slot machine products and gaining market share. The property increased market share by 2% during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, while the market as a whole decreased by 2% during the same time period.

The increase is due to the two cruise ships added during 2011 from the Oceania and TUI cruise lines, which contributed a total of $1.4 million in gaming revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, three new ship-based casinos were added with the Regent Seven Seas cruise line. These three ships added $1.8 million in additional net operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Gaming expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 104.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Concession fees paid to the cruise operators increased by $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. These expenses and fees increased due to the addition of the ships to our portfolio. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.4 million, or 303.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to increased operating costs associated with the setup of the new ships and increased travel for the movement of staff between ships. Earnings from operations increased by $0.5 million, or 885.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.    - 35 -    Corporate Other      For the year ended December 31,         Amounts in thousands   2011     2010     Change     % Change   General and Administrative Expenses    $ (5,746 )    $ (6,019 )    $ 273       (4.5 %) Total Operating Costs and Expenses     (5,989 )     (6,264 )     275       (4.4 %) Losses from Operations     (5,401 )     (5,679 )     278       (4.9 %) Net Loss   $ (3,378 )   $ (4,523 )   $ 1,145       (25.3 %) General and administrative expenses for Corporate Other consist primarily of legal and accounting fees, corporate travel expenses, corporate payroll, the amortization of stock based compensation and other expenses not directly related to any of the company's individual properties. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 4.5%, for year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease is mainly due to a reduction in stock based compensation expense of $0.3 million relating to vesting of restricted stock and a reduction in payroll and legal expenses of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, we recorded approximately $0.2 million in stock based compensation expense as a component of general and administrative expenses. At December 31, 2011, we had less than $0.1 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options. Earnings from Equity Investment We hold a 33.3% ownership interest in and actively participate in the management of CPL. Our portion of CPL’s earnings is recorded as earnings from equity investment. We recorded $0.6 million and $0.5 million of earnings from our investment in CPL for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase is primarily a result of increased gaming revenue. In addition, an increase in the average exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Polish zloty of 1.7% positively impacted our results for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. CPL currently owns and operates four casinos throughout Poland. Until December 2011, CPL owned and operated in three additional casino locations in Krakow, Posnan and Warsaw. In March 2011, following a change of ownership of the landlord of the Krakow casino, CPL was informed that the lease agreement at the Krakow casino would expire on December 31, 2011 and would not be renewed. Based on this information, the depreciation costs related to leasehold improvements completed at the Krakow casino totaling PLN 2.6 million or $0.8 million were fully written off as of December 31, 2011. The casino license expired on December 7, 2011 and was not renewed, although a license was obtained for a new casino in Krakow. In November 2011, the gaming license used to operate the Marriott casino in Warsaw expired. At the time, CPL operated both the Hyatt casino and the Marriott casino in Warsaw. Because CPL management believed that the Marriott casino in Warsaw was more profitable than the Hyatt casino, CPL chose to use the license from the Hyatt casino to continue operating the Marriott casino and ceased operations at the Hyatt casino as permitted by Polish gaming authorities. Therefore the depreciation costs related to leasehold improvements completed at the Hyatt casino totaling PLN 2.4 million or $0.7 million were written off as of December 31, 2011.    - 36 -    On July 29, 2011, our co-shareholders in CPL (LOT Polish Airlines and PPL Polish Airports) informed us of their intent to sell their shares in CPL (66.66% of the total shares) to Totalizator Sportowy Group, the state owned Polish national lottery firm. LOT Polish Airlines and PPL Polish Airports requested our consent to their respective conditional sales agreement, which is necessary for the legal effectiveness of any share transfers. We are evaluating their request. Non-Operating Income (Expense) Non-operating income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:      For the year ended December 31,                 Amounts in thousands   2011     2010     Change     % Change   Gain on Bargain Purchase   $ 0     $ 1,180     $ (1,180 )     (100.0 %) Interest Income     38       50       (12 )     (24.0 %) Interest Expense     (802 )     (1,174 )     372       31.7 % Gains on Foreign Currency Transactions & Other     187       169       18       10.7 % Non-Operating Expense   $ (577 )   $ 225     $ (802 )     (356.4 %)   Gain on bargain purchase During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain on the bargain purchase associated with the Century Casino Calgary acquisition. The gain of $1.2 million is included in non-operating (expense) income on the consolidated statement of earnings. The bargain purchase is the result of the fair market value of the assets acquired exceeding the purchase price. See note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Interest income Interest income is directly related to interest earned on our cash reserves. Interest expense The decrease in interest expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is due to lower principal balances on third party debt related to our Edmonton property.      - 37 -    Taxes The Company’s income tax expense by jurisdiction is summarized in the table below:      For the year ended     For the year ended   Amounts in thousands   December 31, 2011     December 31, 2010        Pre-tax income (loss)     Income tax     Effective     Pre-tax  income (loss)     Income tax     Effective     tax rate     tax rate   Canada   $ 2,701     $ 607       22.5 %   $ 2,591     $ 364       14.1 % United States     (767 )     27       (3.5 %)     (2,388 )     37       (1.6 %) Mauritius     2,178       52       2.4 %     1,500       45       3.0 % Austria     (890 )     2       (0.2 %)     (1,078 )     2       (0.2 %) Poland *     466       (21 )     (4.5 %)     667       (178 )     (26.7 %) Total   $ 3,688     $ 667       18.1 %   $ 1,292     $ 270       20.9 % * Poland includes earnings after tax from the equity investment in CPL.                           The effective tax rates of our foreign properties are impacted by the movement of exchange rates primarily due to loans which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Therefore, foreign currency gains or losses recorded in each property’s local currency do not impact our earnings reported in U.S. dollars. Additionally, due to the bargain purchase of $1.2 million in 2010, which is treated as a permanent difference, the effective tax rate of 14.1% in Canada in 2010 is significantly lower than the statutory rate of 28%. Included in the pre-tax income attributable to Poland are $0.6 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to after tax earnings from our equity investment in CPL.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows Our business is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow. We use the cash flows that we generate to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing activities.   Cash and cash equivalents totaled $25.2 million at December 31, 2011, and we had working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) of $6.0 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $21.5 million and working capital of $9.2 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in cash is due to $10.7 million cash provided by operating activities offset by $4.2 million in repayment of third party mortgage debt related to our Edmonton property. In addition, we invested $2.8 million in various capital expenditure projects. The decrease in working capital is primarily due to classification of the remainder of the Edmonton debt due on December 31, 2012, as current rather than long-term debt.      - 38 -    Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.7 million and $6.8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in net cash resulted from an increase in net operating revenue at all properties. Our cash flows from operations have historically been positive and sufficient to fund ordinary operations. For a description of our cash from operating activities, please also refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and “Results of Operations” in this Item 7.   Net cash used in investing activities of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was used in the acquisition of property and equipment. We used $1.0 million to purchase new slot machines and a kiosk, replace surveillance cameras and purchase property in Central City, $0.6 million to complete electrical and surveillance upgrades and various general building renovations at our property in Calgary, $0.5 million to purchase new slot machines and a kiosk at our property in Cripple Creek, $0.4 million to replace a waterline, complete a beverage station in the poker room and build a smoker shelter at our property in Edmonton and $0.3 million for gaming equipment additions on cruise ship-based casinos. Net cash used in investing activities of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $9.3 million used for the acquisition of Century Casino Calgary and $9.1 million used in the acquisition of property and equipment. We used $3.7 million in building renovations, bowling lane and scoring system refurbishment and surveillance system upgrades in Calgary, $2.2 million to purchase land in Cripple Creek, Colorado to be used as a parking lot, $0.9 million for gaming equipment additions on cruise ship-based casinos placed in service in 2010, $0.6 million to purchase new slot machines at our Cripple Creek and Central City properties, $0.2 million to purchase a new pylon sign at our Edmonton property, $0.1 million for the renovation of the deli and poker room at our property in Central City, $0.1 million to upgrade the elevator at our Edmonton property, $0.1 million to purchase new carpet at our property in Cripple Creek and $1.2 million for cumulative additions at our remaining properties.   Net cash used in financing activities of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of $4.2 million in the repayment and prepayment of the mortgage debt at our property in Edmonton (“Edmonton Mortgage”) offset by a $0.2 million cash dividend received from our equity investment in CPL. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining balance on the Edmonton Mortgage was $9.1 million. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Edmonton Mortgage as of December 31, 2011. The Edmonton Mortgage matures on December 31, 2012. Prior to December 31, 2012, we are able to renegotiate the Edmonton Mortgage for an additional one to five year term. We intend to refinance the Edmonton Mortgage prior to the maturity of the loan.   Net cash used in financing activities of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted of $3.7 million in the repayment and prepayment of the Edmonton Mortgage and $0.1 million for the repurchases of our outstanding common stock pursuant to a publicly announced repurchase program discussed below. Common Stock Repurchase Program Since 2000, we have had a discretionary program to repurchase our outstanding common stock. In November 2009, we increased the amount available to be repurchased to $15.0 million. We did not repurchase any common stock in 2011. During 2010, we repurchased 57,330 shares of our common stock for $0.1 million at a weighted average cost of $2.46 per share. During 2009, we repurchased 53,557 shares of our common stock for $0.1 million at a weighted average cost of $2.43. The total amount remaining under the repurchase program was $14.7 million as of December 31, 2011. The repurchase program has no set expiration or termination date.    - 39 -    Potential Sources of Liquidity, Short-Term Liquidity   Historically, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flow from operations, bank borrowings, sales of existing casino operations and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities.   We expect that the primary source of cash will be from our gaming operations. In addition to the payment of operating costs, expected uses of cash within one year include capital expenditures for our existing properties, interest and principal payments on outstanding debt and potential new projects or dividends, if declared by the Board of Directors. If necessary, we may seek to obtain term loans, mortgages or lines of credit with commercial banks or other debt or equity financings to supplement our working capital and investing requirements.   We believe that our cash at December 31, 2011 as supplemented by cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating costs, capital expenditures at existing properties and current debt repayment obligations for at least the next 12 months. We will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations. From time to time we expect to have cash needs for the development or purchase of new properties that exceed our current borrowing capacity and we may be required to seek additional debt, equity or bank financing.   In addition, we expect our U.S. domestic cash resources will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as debt repayment schedules, material capital expenditures and dividends for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. While we currently do not have an intent nor foresee a need to repatriate funds, if we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our U.S. operations either for operations, capital expenditures or significant discretionary activities such as acquisitions or businesses and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances, which could have adverse tax consequences as we have not accrued taxes for un-repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The determination of the additional deferred taxes that would be provided for undistributed earnings has not been determined because the hypothetical calculation is not practicable.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have issued a guarantee of $1.0 million (€0.8 million) to Bank Austria in connection with our listing of ADCs on the Vienna Stock Exchange. Bank Austria in turn issued a guarantee in the same amount to Oesterreichische Kontrollbank, the holder of our global certificate representing the ADCs. The guarantee is provided to reimburse Oesterreichisch Kontrollbank through Bank Austria for any amounts incurred by it as a result of claims or damages and lawsuits that an ADC holder may raise or file against us. The guarantee is required by the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank.    - 40 -    We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs. Impairment - Goodwill – At December 31, 2011, we had goodwill of $4.8 million at our Edmonton property. Given the historically profitable operations of this reporting unit, no impairments have been recognized on this goodwill. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (as of October 1) or whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value. The implied fair value includes an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Changes in relevant events or circumstances or application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results. Property and Equipment -   We have significant capital invested in our property and equipment, which represents approximately 73% of our total assets as of December 31, 2011. Judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and the extent to which we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets. We review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors we consider in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors. As of December 31, 2011, we believe that our investments in property and equipment are recoverable. Equity Investment – We evaluate our equity investment in Casinos Poland for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If these conditions exist, we compare the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine whether impairment is indicated and determine whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on our assessment of relevant factors, including consideration of our intent and ability to retain our investment. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing estimates of future cash flows and market indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization rates. As of December 31, 2011, the value of our investment in CPL was $2.8 million.    - 41 -    Stock-Based Compensation –    We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires management to estimate certain variables. Such estimates include the estimated lives of options from grant date to exercise date, the volatility of the underlying shares and estimated future dividend rates. The two most significant estimates in the Black-Scholes model are volatility and expected life. An increase in the volatility rate increases the value of stock options and a decrease causes a decline in value. We estimate expected volatility using an average of our common stock price over the expected life of the option. For expected lives, an increase in the expected life of an option increases its value. For all options currently outstanding, we have estimated their expected lives to be the average of their vesting term and their contractual terms. Equity compensation is recorded net of estimated forfeitures over the vesting term. Determining this estimate requires significant judgment on the number of actual awards that will ultimately vest over the term of the award. This estimate is reviewed quarterly and any change in actual forfeitures in comparison to estimates may cause an increase or decrease in the ultimate expense recognized in that period. Income Taxes –    Significant judgment is required in developing our income tax provision. We have a valuation allowance of $5.1 million on our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 due to the uncertainty of future taxable income. We have a $0.9 million valuation allowance on our Calgary property deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 due to the uncertainty of future taxable income. We also have a $1.3 million valuation allowance on our Century Casinos Europe subsidiary deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2011 due to the uncertainty of future taxable income. We will assess the continuing need for a valuation allowance that results from uncertainty regarding our ability to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets. If we conclude that our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not, we will reduce our valuation allowance as appropriate. During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, we identified errors in income tax expense totaling $502,000. These errors related to (i) the inability to realize expected tax benefits from intercompany interest charges in 2007 ($279,000) and 2008 ($45,000) as the tax planning strategy relied upon in 2007-08 was not valid; and, (ii) incorrectly treating an existing accrual for uncertain tax positions as a deferred tax liability for purposes of computing the our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in 2008 ($178,000).  We assessed the impact of these errors on prior annual and interim periods in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99, Materiality (“SAB 99”) and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (“SAB 108”). Based on this assessment we have concluded that the error did not result in a material misstatement of any prior periods, as previously reported.  Therefore to correct these errors relating to prior year income taxes in accordance with SAB 108, we have reduced retained earnings as of January 1, 2010, by $502,000, to reflect revisions pertaining to the 2007 and 2008 statements of operations and recorded a corresponding tax liability in the 2010 balance sheet.      - 42 -    Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein. We are a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT.  We own, operate, and develop manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern, southern, and southeastern United States. As of December 31, 2011, we owned and operated a portfolio of 159 developed properties located in 18 states, including 141 manufactured housing communities, eight RV communities, and 10 properties containing both manufactured housing and RV sites. The majority of our revenue (Income from real property) is affected by occupancy and our ability to raise rents. Our residents normally sign a one year lease and then lease on a month to month basis for the next ten to fifteen years. Few of our leases are tied to published CPI statistics or other indices therefore allowing us significant flexibility in rental increases based on the markets in which we operate. Weighted average rent increases over the last five years have ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.3 percent and we expect to continue to be able to increase rents at or near these levels in the future.  Our occupancy has also increased over the past three years from 83.4% as of December 31, 2009 to 85.3% as of December 31, 2011. Our Rental Program is a significant contributor to the stability and improvement of our occupancies and revenue stream.  Over the past several years, the Rental Program has been the single largest contributor to the generation of applications to live in our communities, which numbered nearly 23,500 in 2011. We own and rent approximately 7,000 homes throughout our portfolio applying stringent approval standards (over 50% of our rental applications are denied) to each applicant thereby ensuring maintenance of the quality of our communities as desirable neighborhoods in which to live. During 2011, occupants in the Rental Program increased by 906. Home sales units sold have increased from 1,375 in 2010 to 1,439 in 2011 and we anticipate selling approximately 1,750 homes in the coming year. Our ability to sell homes is dependent on access to financing for the prospective buyer.  Although the majority of our home sales are financed through third party lenders, some of which we provide recourse, we do provide financing for certain home purchasers who are unable to obtain financing through other means. The economic downturns and market volatility during the past few years have presented both challenges and opportunities. We provide affordable housing to the marketplace which, in difficult times, improves demand for the housing values that our products and programs offer. This demand is somewhat offset by job losses in our resident base resulting from businesses closing and layoffs which occur in times of economic contraction. The broader financial markets which provide capital for funding our continued growth and refinancing of debt are improving, but remain constrained and contain terms more restrictive than when most of our current debt was originated.        28    CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimate and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Management believes the following significant accounting policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements: Investment Property Investment property is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation.  We review the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used for impairment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Circumstances that may prompt a test of recoverability may include a significant decrease in the anticipated market price, an adverse change to the extent or manner in which an asset may be used or in its physical condition or other such events that may significantly change the value of the long-lived asset.  An impairment loss is recognized when a long-lived asset’s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of our long lived assets based on future cash flows and any potential disposition proceeds for a given asset. Forecasting cash flows requires management to make estimates and assumptions about such variables as the estimated holding period, rental rates, occupancy, development and operating expenses during the holding period, as well as disposition proceeds.  Management uses its best judgment when developing these estimates and assumptions, but the development of the projected future cash flows is based on subjective variables. Future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist, and significant adverse changes in national, regional, or local market conditions or trends may cause us to change the estimates and assumptions used in our impairment analysis.  The results of an impairment analysis could be material to our financial statements. Capitalized Costs We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with the development, redevelopment, capital enhancement and leasing of our properties. Management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization. The amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred. Renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete. Costs incurred to renovate repossessed homes for our Rental Program are capitalized and costs incurred to refurbish the homes at turnover and repair the homes while occupied are expensed. Certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period based on the anticipated term of occupancy of a resident. Costs associated with implementing our computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware. Notes and Other Receivables We provide financing to purchasers of manufactured homes generally located in our communities.  The notes are collateralized by the underlying manufactured home sold.  Notes receivable include both installment loans retained by the Company as well as transferred loans that have not met the requirements for sale accounting which are presented herein as collateralized receivables (See Note 5 for additional information).  For purposes of accounting policy, all notes receivable are considered one homogenous segment, as the notes are typically underwritten using the same requirements and terms.  Notes receivable are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance adjusted for an allowance for loan loss.  Interest income is accrued based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loans. Past due status of our notes receivable is determined based upon the contractual terms of the note.  When a note receivable becomes 60 days delinquent, we stop accruing interest on the note receivable. The interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis until qualifying for return to accrual.  Loans are returned to accrual when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.  Loans on a nonaccrual status were immaterial at December 31, 2011 and 2010.  The ability to collect our notes receivable is measured based on current and historical information and events. We consider numerous factors including: length of delinquency, estimated costs to lease or sell, and repossession history.    Our experience supports a high recovery rate for notes receivable; however there is some degree of uncertainty about the recoverability of our investment in these notes receivable.  We are generally able to recover our recorded investment in uncollectible notes receivable by repossessing the homes on the notes retained by us and repurchasing the homes on the collateralized receivables, and subsequently selling or leasing these homes to potential residents in our communities.  We have established a loan loss reserve based on our estimated unrecoverable costs associated with repossessed/repurchased homes.  We estimate our unrecoverable costs to be the repurchase price of the home collateralizing the note receivable plus repair and remarketing costs in excess of the estimated selling price of the home being repossessed.  A historical average of this excess cost is calculated based on prior repossessions/repurchases and is applied to our estimated annual future repossessions to create the allowance for both installment and collateralized notes receivable. See Note 6 for additional information.    29    We evaluate the collectability of a loan based on our ability to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  We generally see that if the obligor is delinquent on the loan they are also delinquent on site rent. If the scheduled payment is delinquent more than five to seven days, dependent on state law, we begin the repossession and eviction process simultaneously.  This process generally takes 30 to 45 days; due to the short time frame from delinquent loan to repossession we do not evaluate the notes receivables for impairments. No loans were considered impaired as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. We evaluate the credit quality of our notes receivable at the inception of the receivable. We consider the following factors in order to determine the credit quality of the applicant- FICO scores; home debt to income ratio; total debt to income ratio; length of employment; and previous landlord references. Other receivables are generally comprised of amounts due from residents for rent and related charges, home sale proceeds receivable from sales near year end and various other miscellaneous receivables.  Accounts receivable from residents are typically due within 30 days and stated at amounts due from residents net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.  We evaluate the recoverability of our receivables whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan and lease agreements. Receivables related to community rents are reserved when we believe that collection is less than probable, which is generally after a resident balance reaches 60 to 90 days past due. Investment in Affiliates Investments in affiliates in which we do not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.  The carrying value of our investment is adjusted for our proportionate share of the affiliate’s net income or loss and reduced by distributions received.  We review the carrying value of our investment in affiliates for other than temporary impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment.  Financial condition, operational performance, and other economic trends are some of the factors we consider when we evaluate the existence of impairment indicators.  When we have a carrying value of zero for our investment, we suspend the equity method of accounting until such time that the affiliate’s net income equals or exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the time in which the equity method of accounting was suspended. Revenue Recognition Rental income attributable to site and home leases is recorded on a straight-line basis when earned from tenants. Leases entered into by tenants are generally for one year terms but may range from month-to-month to two years and are renewable by mutual agreement from us and the resident, or in some cases, as provided by state statute. Revenue from the sale of manufactured homes is recognized upon transfer of title at the closing of the sales transaction.  Interest income on notes receivable is recorded on a level yield basis over the life of the notes.  We report certain taxes collected from the resident and remitted to taxing authorities in revenue.  These taxes include certain Florida property and fire taxes. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives are 30 years for land improvements and buildings, 10 years for rental homes, seven to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, and seven years for intangible assets. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We have four derivative contracts consisting of two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $45.0 million, and an two interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of $162.4 million as of December 31, 2011. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes.  For those hedges that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting, we adjust our balance sheet on a quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of our derivatives. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings or comprehensive income (loss), as appropriate. The ineffective portion of these hedges are immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged.  The effective portion of these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  We use standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments, including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized.    30    Income Taxes We have elected to be taxed as a REIT as defined under Section 856(c) of the Code. In order for us to qualify as a REIT, at least ninety-five percent (95%) of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level if we distribute at least ninety percent (90%) of its REIT ordinary taxable income to our stockholders, which we fully intend to do. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We remain subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property as well as Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. We are subject to certain state taxes that are considered income taxes and have certain subsidiaries that are taxed as regular corporations. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is established if based on available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03, “Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements” (ASU 2011-03) which amends ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing.  The updated guidance in ASC Topic 860 removes from the assessment of effective control (1) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. The updated guidance in ASC Topic 860 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011.  Early adoption is not permitted.  The adoption of this guidance will not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition, and we will apply the provisions after the effective date. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs” (ASU 2011-04) which amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.  The updated guidance in ASC Topic 820 changes the wording used to describe the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.   The updated guidance in ASC Topic 820 is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.  Early adoption is not permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2011-04 on our results of operations, financial condition and disclosure requirements.  We will apply the provisions of these accounting standards after the effective date. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income” (ASU 2011-05) which amends ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income.  The updated guidance in ASC Topic 220 gives an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.   The updated guidance in ASC Topic 220 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.   Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)—Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-12” (ASU 2011-12) to defer the effective date for part of ASU 2011-05.  The deferral of ASU 2011-05 is to defer the requirement of adjustments of items out of accumulated other income to be presented on the components of both net income and other comprehensive income in financial statements.  This deferral  is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, so that entities will not be required to comply with the presentations requirements in ASU 2011-05 that ASU 2011-12 is deferring.   Early adoption is permitted.  The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition.    31    SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES In addition to the results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided information regarding Net Operating Income (“NOI”) in the following tables. NOI is derived from revenues minus property operating expenses and real estate taxes. We use NOI as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of our operations. A reconciliation of NOI to net income (loss) attributable to Sun Communities, Inc. is included in “Results of Operations” below. We believe that NOI is helpful to investors and analysts as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment, and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. We use NOI as a key management tool when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and/or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it excludes depreciation, amortization, interest expense, and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant costs, and therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of our properties rather than of the Company overall.  We believe that these costs included in net income (loss) often have no effect on the market value of our property and therefore limit its use as a performance measure. In addition, such expenses are often incurred at a parent company level and therefore are not necessarily linked to the performance of a real estate asset. NOI should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions.  NOI, as determined and presented by us, may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies.   We also provide information regarding Funds From Operations (“FFO”).  We consider FFO an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity REIT. Under the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition, FFO represents net income, excluding extraordinary items (as defined under GAAP), and gain (loss) on sales of depreciable property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.   Management also uses FFO-Adjusted a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business.  We believe that FFO-Adjusted provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results.  A discussion of FFO, FFO-Adjusted, a reconciliation of FFO to net loss, and FFO to FFO-Adjusted are included in the presentation of FFO in “Results of Operations” following the “Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010”.      32    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We report operating results under two segments: Real Property Operations and Home Sales and Rentals.  The Real Property Operations segment owns, operates, and develops manufactured housing and RV communities concentrated in the midwestern, southern, and southeastern United States and is in the business of acquiring, operating, and expanding manufactured housing and RV communities.  The Home Sales and Rentals segment offers manufactured home sales and leasing services to tenants and prospective tenants of our communities.  We evaluate segment operating performance based on NOI. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements, except for the use of NOI. We may allocate certain common costs, primarily corporate functions, between the segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These allocated costs include expenses for shared services such as information technology, finance, communications, legal, and human resources. We do not allocate interest expense and certain other corporate costs not directly associated with the segments’ NOI.

Same Site communities consist of properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.  The Same Site data may change from time-to-time depending on acquisitions, dispositions, management discretion, significant transactions, or unique situations. In order to evaluate the growth of the Same Site communities, management has classified certain items differently than our GAAP statements.  The reclassification difference between our GAAP statements and our Same Site portfolio is the reclassification of water and sewer revenues from income from real property to utilities.  A significant portion of our utility charges are re-billed to our residents.   We reclassify these amounts to reflect the utility expenses associated with our Same Site portfolio, net of recovery. The following tables reflect certain financial and other information for our Same Site communities as of and for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:       Years Ended          December 31,     Financial Information (in thousands)    2011       2010       Change       % Change     Income from Real Property    $ 198,806       $ 193,070       $ 5,736          3.0 %  Property operating expenses:                                                  Payroll and benefits       16,223          15,951          272          1.7 %  Legal, taxes, & insurance       2,993          2,934          59          2.0 %  Utilities       11,004          11,451          (447 )       -3.9 %  Supplies and repair       8,163          7,597          566          7.5 %  Other       4,310          3,633          677          18.6 %  Real estate taxes       16,055          16,282          (227 )       -1.4 %  Property operating expenses       58,748          57,848          900          1.6 %  Real Property NOI    $ 140,058       $ 135,222       $ 4,836          3.6 %       As of December 31,     Other Information    2011       2010       Change     Number of properties       136          136          -     Developed sites       47,850          47,683          167     Occupied sites (1)       39,230          38,498          732     Occupancy % (1)(2)       85.8 %       84.5 %       1.3 %  Weighted average monthly rent per site (3)    $ 425       $ 413       $ 12     Sites available for development       5,247          5,441          (194 ) (1 )      Occupied sites and occupancy % include manufactured housing and permanent RV sites, and exclude seasonal RV sites. (2)      Occupancy % excludes completed but vacant expansion sites. (3 )        Average rent relates only to manufactured housing sites, and excludes permanent and seasonal RV sites. Real Property NOI increased by $4.8 million from $135.2 million to $140.0 million, or 3.6 percent. The growth in NOI is primarily due to increased revenues. Income from real property revenues consist of manufactured home and RV site rent, and miscellaneous other property revenues.  Income from real property revenues increased $5.7 million, from $193.1 million to $198.8 million, or 3.0 percent.  The growth in income from real property was due to a combination of factors.  Revenue from our manufactured home and RV portfolio increased by $5.3 million due to average rental rate increases of 2.7 percent and due to the increased number of occupied home sites. This growth in revenue was partially offset by rent concessions offered to new residents and current residents converting from home renters to home owners.  Additionally, we experienced increased miscellaneous other property revenues of $0.4 million primarily due to revenue realized on cable television royalties and revenue from late fee and non-sufficient funds charges.  Property operating expenses increased $0.9 million, from $57.8 million to $58.7 million, or 1.6 percent.  The growth in property operating expenses was due to several factors.  Payroll and benefits increased by $0.3 million due to increased wages from annual merit increases. Supplies and repairs increased by $0.6 million primarily due to increased cost of lawn services and community maintenance.  Utility costs reported net of rebilled water/sewer revenue, primarily related to water, electricity charges, and rubbish removal, decreased $0.4 million due to increased water and sewer income.  Real estate taxes decreased by $0.2 million primarily due to reduced real estate taxes in Indiana and Illinois.  Legal, taxes and insurance remained nearly constant.  Other operating expenses increased by $0.6 million due to increased bank charges, resident relation expenses, and bad debt expense.    34      HOME SALES AND RENTALS   We acquire pre-owned and repossessed manufactured homes located within our communities from lenders and dealers at substantial discounts.  We lease or sell these value priced homes to current and prospective residents.  We also purchase new homes to lease and sell to current and prospective residents.  The programs we have established for our customers to lease or buy new and pre-owned homes have helped to improve portfolio occupancy.

The site rent is reflected in the Real Property Operations segment. For purposes of management analysis, the site rent is included in the Rental Program revenue to evaluate the incremental revenue gains associated with implementation of the Rental Program, and assess the overall growth and performance of Rental Program and financial impact to our operations. Rental Program NOI increased $4.3 million from $33.7 million to $38.0 million, or 12.9 percent due to increased revenues of $5.1 million, offset by increased expenses of $0.8 million. Revenues increased $5.1 million primarily due to the increased number of residents participating in the Rental Program as indicated in the table above and from increased market rates from the site rent. The increase in operating and maintenance expenses of $0.8 million was due to several factors.  Commissions increased by $0.3 million due to increased number of new leases and increased lease renewal rate.  Repairs costs on occupied home rentals increased by $0.3 million due to the increased number of homes in the Rental Program.  Refurbishment costs increased by $0.1 million.  Marketing and other costs increased by $0.1 million due to an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a decrease in utility expense.    35    The following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for our Home Sales Program for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:       Years Ended          December 31,     Financial Information (in thousands)    2011       2010       Change       % Change     New home sales    $ 2,062       $ 2,396       $ (334 )       -13.9 %  Pre-owned home sales       30,190          29,549          641          2.2 %  Revenue from homes sales       32,252          31,945          307          1.0 %                                                     New home cost of sales       1,700          2,044          (344 )       -16.8 %  Pre-owned home cost of sales       23,692          21,986          1,706          7.8 %  Cost of home sales       25,392          24,030          1,362          5.7 %                                                     NOI / Gross profit    $ 6,860       $ 7,915       $ (1,055 )       -13.3 %                                                     Gross profit – new homes       362          352          10          2.8 %  Gross margin % – new homes       17.6 %       14.7 %                   2.9 %                                                     Gross profit – pre-owned homes       6,498          7,563          (1,065 )       -14.1 %  Gross margin % – pre-owned homes       21.5 %       25.6 %                   -4.1 %                                                     Statistical Information                                                  Home sales volume:                                                  New home sales       28          36          (8 )       -22.2 %  Pre-owned home sales       1,411          1,339          72          5.4 %  Total homes sold       1,439          1,375          64          4.7 % Home Sales NOI decreased by $1.0 million, from $7.9 million to $6.9 million, or 13.3 percent primarily due to reduced profit margins on pre-owned homes. The gross profit margin on new home sales slightly increased due to the increased average selling price per new home sold.  The gross profit margin on pre-owned home sales decreased 4.1 percent from 25.6 percent to 21.5 percent.  We decreased the average margin of our pre-owned homes to stimulate sales thereby accelerating the recycling of the capital invested in inventory and the Rental Program.  Approximately 90 percent of these home sales are financed by third party lenders or are paid for in cash.    36    OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS Other revenues include other income (loss), interest income, and ancillary revenues, net.  Other revenues increased by $2.0 million, from $9.0 million to $11.0 million, or 22.2 percent.  This was due to an increase in interest income of $1.5 million from collateralized receivables, a $0.4 million increase in other income, primarily due to the sale of certain raw water rights, and a $0.1 million increase in ancillary revenues, net. Real Property general and administrative costs increased by $2.5 million, from $17.2 million to $19.7 million, or 14.5 percent due to increased wages, bonus, payroll taxes and health benefits of $1.5 million mainly from additional resources from acquisition and growth, employee relation expenses of $0.1 million, training and travel expense of $0.1 million, office expenses of $0.1 million and increased tax expense of $0.7 million.  Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 included a $0.7 million reversal of a state tax provision recorded in December of 2009 and the year ended December 31, 2011 does not contain such a reversal.   Home Sales and Rentals general and administrative costs increased by $0.5 million, from $7.6 million to $8.1 million, or 6.6 percent due to increased salary, commission costs and payroll tax of $0.4 million and increased inventory utility costs of $0.1 million.  Acquisition related costs increased to $2.0 million (See Note 2). Depreciation and amortization costs increased by $5.3 million, from $68.9 million to $74.2 million, or 7.7 percent due to increased depreciation on investment property for use in our Rental Program of $1.9 million and increased other depreciation and amortization of $3.4 million primarily due to the newly acquired properties (See Note 2). Interest expense on debt, including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt, increased by $2.5 million, from $65.4 million to $67.9 million, or 3.8 percent due to increased expense associated with our secured borrowing arrangements of $1.5 million, an increase in our mortgage interest of $0.8 million, an increase in interest on our lines of credit of $0.3 million and a $2.0 million increase due to acquisition related debt (See Note 2).   This was offset by a $0.1 million reduction in bank service charges and a $2.0 million reduction in interest expense primarily due to the settlement with FNMA (See Note 9).   Equity income (loss) and distributions from affiliates increased by $3.2 million, from a loss of $1.1 million to income of $2.1 million due to the suspension of equity accounting in 2010 as our investment below is zero.  The income recorded in 2011 is dividend income.    37    COMPARISON OF THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 REAL PROPERTY OPERATIONS - SAME SITE A key management tool we use when evaluating performance and growth of our properties is a comparison of Same Site communities. Same Site communities consist of properties owned and operated for the same period in both years for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  Our Same Site portfolio is equal to our total portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.  The Same Site data may change from time-to-time depending on acquisitions, dispositions, management discretion, significant transactions, or unique situations. In order to evaluate the growth of the Same Site communities, management has classified certain items differently than our GAAP statements.  The reclassification difference between our GAAP statements and our Same Site portfolio is the reclassification of water and sewer revenues from income from real property to utilities.  A significant portion of our utility charges are re-billed to our residents.   We reclassify these amounts to reflect the utility expenses associated with our Same Site portfolio, net of recovery.

The growth in NOI is primarily due to increased revenues. Income from real property revenues consist of manufactured home and RV site rent, and miscellaneous other property revenues.  Income from real property revenues increased $4.6 million, from $188.4 million to $193.0 million, or 2.5 percent.  The growth in income from real property was due to a combination of factors.  Revenue from our manufactured home and RV portfolio increased by $4.2 million due to average rental rate increases of 2.6 percent and due to the increased number of occupied home sites. This growth in revenue was partially offset by rent concessions offered to new residents and current residents converting from home renters to home owners.  Additionally, we experienced increased miscellaneous other property revenues of $0.4 million primarily due to revenue realized on cable television royalties.  Property operating expenses increased $0.6 million, from $57.3 million to $57.9 million, or 1.0 percent.  The growth in property operating expenses was due to several factors.  Payroll and benefits increased by $0.4 million due to increased wages from annual merit increases. Supplies and repairs increased by $0.8 million primarily due to increased cost of lawn services, water system and community maintenance.  Utility costs, primarily related to water, electricity charges, and rubbish removal, decreased $0.5 million due to increased water and sewer income.  Real estate taxes decreased by $0.3 million primarily due to tax appeal refunds and reduced real estate taxes in Indiana.  Property and casualty insurance decreased by $0.1 million due to decreased premiums on insurance policies.  Other operating expenses increased by $0.3 million due to increased administrative costs, resident relations, and bad debt expense. HOME SALES AND RENTALS We acquire pre-owned and repossessed manufactured homes located within our communities from lenders and dealers at substantial discounts.  We lease or sell these value priced homes to current and prospective residents.  We also purchase new homes to lease and sell to current and prospective residents.  The programs we have established for our customers to lease or buy new and pre-owned homes have helped to improve portfolio occupancy.

The site rent is reflected in the Real Property Operations segment. For purposes of management analysis, the site rent is included in the Rental Program revenue to evaluate the incremental revenue gains associated with implementation of the Rental Program, and assess the overall growth and performance of Rental Program and financial impact to our operations. Rental Program NOI increased $2.8 million from $30.9 million to $33.7 million, or 9.0 percent due to increased revenues of $1.9 million and by decreased expenses of $0.9 million. Revenues increased $1.9 million primarily due to the increased number of residents participating in the Rental Program as indicated in the table above. The decrease in operating and maintenance expenses of $0.9 million was due to several factors.  Commissions decreased by $0.7 million due to restructuring of the commission plan associated with new and renewed leases.  Expenses associated with repairs and refurbishment increased by $0.2 million.  Repairs costs on occupied home rentals increased by $0.3 million due to the increased number of occupied homes in the Rental Program offset by refurbishment costs which decreased by $0.1 million due to a decline in the average cost associated with preparing a previously leased home for a new occupant.  Marketing and other costs decreased by $0.4 million due to reductions in bad debt expense and advertising expenses.    39    The following table reflects certain financial and statistical information for our Home Sales Program for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:       Years Ended          December 31,     Financial Information (in thousands)    2010       2009       Change       % Change     New home sales    $ 2,396       $ 5,049       $ (2,653 )       -52.5 %  Pre-owned home sales       29,549          27,672          1,877          6.8 %  Revenue from homes sales       31,945          32,721          (776 )       -2.4 %                                                     New home cost of sales       2,044          4,261          (2,217 )       -52.0 %  Pre-owned home cost of sales       21,986          19,222          2,764          14.4 %  Cost of home sales       24,030          23,483          547          2.3 %                                                     NOI / Gross profit    $ 7,915       $ 9,238       $ (1,323 )       -14.3 %                                                     Gross profit – new homes       352          788          (436 )       -55.3 %  Gross margin % – new homes       14.7 %       15.6 %                   -0.9 %                                                     Gross profit – pre-owned homes       7,563          8,450          (887 )       -10.5 %  Gross margin % – pre-owned homes       25.6 %       30.5 %                   -4.9 %                                                     Statistical Information                                                  Home sales volume:                                                  New home sales       36          71          (35 )       -49.3 %  Pre-owned home sales       1,339          1,045          294          28.1 %  Total homes sold       1,375          1,116          259          23.2 % Home Sales NOI decreased by $1.3 million, from $9.2 million to $7.9 million, or 14.3 percent due to decreased profit margins on new and pre-owned homes. The gross profit margin on new home sales decreased 0.9 percent from 15.6 percent to 14.7 percent.   The gross profit decreased by 55.3 percent from $0.8 million to $0.4 million which was primarily due to a 49.3 percent decline in sales volume. The gross profit margin on pre-owned home sales decreased 4.9 percent from 30.5 percent to 25.6 percent.  The majority of our pre-owned home sales are related to homes previously used in our Rental Program. These sales convert home renters to home owners and thereby allow us to recycle capital invested in the Rental Program. We decreased the average selling price of our pre-owned homes to increase the volume of sales thereby accelerating the recycling of this capital.  Approximately 90 percent of these home sales are financed by third party lenders or are paid for in cash.    40    OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS Other revenues include other income (loss), interest income, and ancillary revenues, net.  Other revenues increased by $2.0 million, from $7.0 million to $9.0 million, or 28.6 percent.  This increase was due to increased interest income of $2.0 million. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the additional installment notes receivable recognized in association with the transfer of financial assets that are recorded as collateralized receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The interest income on these collateralized receivables is offset by the same amount of interest expense recognized on the secured debt recorded in association with this transaction. See Note 5 for additional information. Real Property general and administrative costs decreased by $0.5 million, from $17.7 million to $17.2 million, or 2.9 percent due to reduced sales, use and other tax expense of $1.5 million and decreased salary and other compensation costs of $0.1 million offset by increased legal costs of $0.5 million and increased other expenses of $0.6 million.  The decreased sales, use and other tax expense includes $1.6 million decrease due to the reversal of a provision for $0.7 million related to the filing methodology for federally disregarded single member limited liability companies under the former Michigan Single Business Tax. The liability was required to be recorded at December 31, 2009 and was reversed in March 2010 after legislative action by the State of Michigan.   Home Sales and Rentals general and administrative costs increased by $0.2 million, from $7.4 million to $7.6 million, or 2.7 percent due to increased salary costs of $0.4 million offset by a decrease in leasing costs of $0.1 million and a decrease in taxes and insurance of $0.1 million.  Georgia flood damage charges of $0.8 million were recorded due to a flood that caused substantial damage to our property, Countryside Village of Atlanta, located in Lawrenceville, Georgia in 2009.  See Note 4 for additional information. Depreciation and amortization costs increased by $1.4 million, from $67.4 million to $68.9 million, or 2.1 percent due to increased depreciation on investment property for use in our Rental Program of $0.7 million and increased amortization of promotions and other depreciation of $0.7 million. Interest expense on debt, including interest on mandatorily redeemable debt, increased by $2.6 million, from $62.8 million to $65.4 million, or 4.2 percent due to increased expense associated with the increase in our FNMA facility fee of $0.9 million and our secured borrowing arrangements of $2.8 million partially offset by a reduction in expense of $1.1 million primarily due to lower interest rates charged on variable rate debt.  The interest expense on our secured borrowing is offset completely by the interest income recognized on our collateralized receivables.  See Note 5 for additional information. Equity loss from affiliates decreased by $1.1 million, from a loss of $2.2 million, to loss of $1.1 million, net of $0.5 million cash distribution, or 50.0 percent due to limited recognition of our allocation of Origen’s and the LLC’s equity losses.  We suspend equity accounting in periods in which the recognition of equity losses would reduce the carrying value of our investment below zero. Provision for state income taxes increased by $0.1 million, from $0.4 million to $0.5 million, or 25.0 percent due to the utilization of investment tax credits which reduced tax expense in 2009.    41    The following table is a summary of our consolidated financial results which were discussed in more detail in the preceding paragraphs (in thousands):       Years Ended          December 31,          2011       2010       2009     Real Property NOI    $ 146,876       $ 135,222       $ 131,131     Rental Program NOI       37,991          33,651          30,871     Home Sales NOI/Gross Profit       6,860          7,915          9,238     Site rent from Rental Program (included in Real Property NOI)       (31,897 )       (28,585 )       (26,699 )  NOI/Gross profit       159,830          148,203          144,541     Adjustments to arrive at net loss:                                      Other revenues       11,030          9,047          6,993     General and administrative       (27,860 )       (24,810 )       (25,099 )  Georgia flood damage       -          -          (800 )  Acquisition related costs       (1,971 )       -          -     Depreciation and amortization       (74,193 )       (68,868 )       (67,423 )  Asset impairment charge       (1,382 )       -                 Interest expense       (67,939 )       (65,427 )       (62,779 )  Provision for state income taxes       (150 )       (512 )       (413 )  Equity income (loss) and distributions from affiliates       2,100          (1,146 )       (2,176 )  Loss from continuing operations       (535 )       (3,513 )       (7,156 )  Loss from discontinued operations       -          -          (227 )  Net loss       (535 )       (3,513 )       (7,383 )  Less:  preferred return to Preferred OP units       1,222          -          -     Less:  amounts attributable to common noncontrolling interests       (671 )       (630 )       (1,081 )  Net loss attributable to Sun Communities, Inc. common stockholders    $ (1,086 )    $ (2,883 )    $ (6,302 ) FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS We provide information regarding FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance.  FFO is defined by the NAREIT as net income (loss) (computed in accordance GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Due to the variety among owners of identical assets in similar condition (based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), we believe excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization, provides a better indicator of our operating performance.  FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from net income (loss).  Management believes that the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.  Management, the investment community, and banking institutions routinely use FFO, together with other measures, to measure operating performance in our industry. Further, management uses FFO for planning and forecasting future periods.   Because FFO excludes significant economic components of net income (loss) including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as an adjunct to net income (loss) and not as an alternative to net income (loss). The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income (loss) as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT’s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. FFO only provides investors with an additional performance measure. Management also uses FFO-Adjusted a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of our core business.  We believe that FFO-Adjusted provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable when evaluating period over period results.   Other REITs may use different methods for calculating FFO and FFO-Adjusted and, accordingly, our FFO and FFO-Adjusted may not be comparable to other REITs.      42    FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, CONTINUED The following table reconciles net loss to FFO and FFO-Adjusted, and calculates FFO and FFO-Adjusted data for diluted purposes for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (in thousands, except for per share/OP unit amounts):       Years Ended          December 31,          2011       2010       2009     Net loss attributable to Sun Communities, Inc. common stockholders    $ (1,086 )    $ (2,883 )    $ (6,302 )  Adjustments:                                      Preferred return to Preferred OP units       1,222          -          -     Amounts attributable to common noncontrolling interests       (671 )       (630 )       (1,081 )  Depreciation and amortization       75,479          70,578          69,301     Gain on disposition of assets, net       (2,635 )       (4,300 )       (5,845 )  Funds from operations ("FFO")    $ 72,309       $ 62,765       $ 56,073     Adjustments:                                      Michigan Business tax/reversal       -          (740 )       740     Georgia flood damage       -          -          800     Equity affiliate adjustment (1)       -          1,646          1,654     OFS LLC impairment charge       -          -          322     Acquisition related costs       1,971          -          -     Asset impairment charge       1,382          -          -     Benefit for state income taxes (2)       (407 )       (32 )       (97 )   FFO-Adjusted    $ 75,255       $ 63,639       $ 59,492                                            Weighted average common shares outstanding:       21,147          19,168          18,484     Add:                                      OP units       2,075          2,114          2,179     Restricted stock       235          153          170     Common stock issuable upon conversion of Preferred OP units       580          -          -     Common stock issuable upon conversion of stock options       16          9          -     Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted (FFO and FFO-Adjusted)       24,053          21,444          20,833                                            Funds from operations per share - diluted    $ 3.01       $ 2.93       $ 2.69     FFO-Adjusted per share - diluted    $ 3.13       $ 2.97       $ 2.86       (1) This amount represents our equity loss from affiliates in 2010 and 2009.  Origen declared cash dividends of $2.1 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which remain in FFO and FFO-Adjusted.  No cash dividends were declared for the year ended December 31, 2009.    (2) The state income tax benefit for the period ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 represents the reversal of the Michigan Business Tax provision previously recorded.    43    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal liquidity demands have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, distributions to our stockholders and the unitholders of the Operating Partnership, capital improvements to properties, the purchase of new and pre-owned homes, property acquisitions, development and expansion of properties, and debt repayment. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through working capital provided by operating activities and through borrowings on our lines of credit. We consider these resources to be adequate to meet our operating requirements, including recurring capital improvements, routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature, payment of dividends to our stockholders to maintain qualification as a REIT in accordance with the Code, and payment of distributions to our Operating Partnership’s unitholders. We closed on four acquisitions in 2011 in which we acquired 23 properties in total, 18 manufactured housing communities and five RV communities.  Subsequent to year end, we acquired three additional RV communities.  See Note 2 for details on the acquisitions.  We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria for acquisition.  Should additional investment opportunities arise in 2012, we will finance the acquisitions through secured financing, the assumption of existing debt on the properties or the issuance of certain equity securities.   During the year ended December 31, 2011, we have invested $35.9 million related to the acquisition of homes intended for the Rental Program net of proceeds from third party financing from homes sales.  Expenditures for 2012 will be dependent upon the condition of the markets for repossessions and new home sales, as well as rental homes. We finance new home purchases with a $12.0 million floor plan facility. Our ability to purchase homes for sale or rent may be limited by cash received from third party financing of our home sales, available floor plan financing and working capital available on our secured line of credit. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.5 million from $8.4 million at December 31, 2010, to $5.9 million as of December 31, 2011. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased by $4.4 million from $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $63.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things: (a) the market and economic conditions in our current markets generally, and specifically in metropolitan areas of our current markets; (b) lower occupancy and rental rates of our properties; (c) increased operating costs, such as wage and benefit costs, insurance premiums, real estate taxes and utilities, that cannot be passed on to our tenants; (d) decreased sales of manufactured homes and (e) current volatility in economic conditions and the financial markets.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. We have a secured revolving line of credit facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of $130.0 million, subject to certain borrowing base calculations. The outstanding balance on the line of credit at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $107.5 million and $81.0 million, respectively. In addition, $4.0 million of availability was used to back standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Borrowings under the line of credit bear a floating interest rate based on Eurodollar plus a margin that is determined based on our leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the line of credit agreement, which can range from 2.25% to 2.95%.  The effective weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 3.4 percent as of December 31, 2011.  As of December 31, 2011, $18.5 million was available to be drawn under the facility based on the calculation of the borrowing base.  During 2011, the highest balance on the line of credit was $107.5 million.  The borrowings under the line of credit mature October 1, 2015, assuming the election of a one year extension that is available at our discretion, subject to certain conditions.  Although the secured revolving line of credit is a committed facility, the financial failure of one or more of the participating financial institutions may reduce the amount of available credit for use by us. The line of credit facility contains various leverage, fixed charge coverage, net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which we were in compliance with as of December 31, 2011. The most limiting covenants contained in the line of credit are the maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios. The maximum leverage ratio covenant requires that total indebtedness be no more than 70 percent of total asset value as defined in the terms of the line of credit agreement.  The minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant requires a minimum ratio of 1.45:1.  As of December 31, 2011, the leverage coverage was 63.0 percent and the fixed charge coverage ratio was 1.86:1.    44    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, CONTINUED The slow economy and the conservative lending environment have generally resulted in a reduction of availability of financing and higher borrowing costs.  Although base interest rates have generally decreased relative to their levels prior to the disruptions in the financial markets, the tightening of credit markets has affected the credit risk spreads charged over base interest rates on, and the availability of, mortgage loan financing. For us, this is the most relevant consequence of financial market volatility.  We believe this risk is somewhat mitigated because we have adequate working capital provided by operating activities as noted above and debt maturities are appropriately staggered We anticipate meeting our long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled debt maturities, large property acquisitions, and Operating Partnership unit redemptions through the issuance of certain debt or equity securities and/or the collateralization of our properties. We currently have 32 unencumbered properties with an estimated market value of $233.7 million, most of which support the borrowing base for our $130.0 million secured line of credit.  From time to time, we may also issue shares of our capital stock or preferred stock, issue equity units in our Operating Partnership, utilize debt and/or equity venture capital, or sell selected assets. Our ability to finance our long-term liquidity requirements in such a manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time, including the availability and cost of mortgage debt, our financial condition, the operating history of the properties, the state of the debt and equity markets, and the general national, regional, and local economic conditions.  When it becomes necessary for us to approach the credit markets, the volatility in those markets could make borrowing more difficult to secure, more expensive, or effectively unavailable.  See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.  If we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted. Our primary long-term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness. As of December 31, 2011, our outstanding contractual obligations, including interest expense, were as follows:               Payments Due By Period                  (In thousands)    Contractual Cash Obligations    Total Due       < 1 year       1-3 years       3-5 years       After 5 years                                                                                           Collateralized term loans - CMBS    $ 629,229       $ 8,452       $ 190,725       $ 264,803       $ 165,249     Collateralized term loans - FNMA       364,581          4,771          11,709          16,161          331,940     Aspen and Series B-3 Preferred OP Units       48,822          4,670          8,370          -          35,782     Lines of credit       129,034          5,534          -          107,500          16,000     Secured borrowing       81,682          3,450          7,923          9,661          60,648     Mortgage notes, other       143,877          20,148          51,597          53,927          18,205     Total principal payments    $ 1,397,225       $ 47,025       $ 270,324       $ 452,052       $ 627,824                                                                    Interest expense (1)       372,555          59,971          109,263          82,415          120,906     Operating leases       3,925          873          1,747          1,305          -     Total contractual obligations    $ 1,773,705       $ 107,869       $ 381,334       $ 535,772       $ 748,730    (1)   Our contractual cash obligation related to interest expense is calculated based on the current debt levels, rates and maturities as of December 31, 2011 excluding secured borrowings, and actual payments required in future periods may be different than the amounts included above. As of December 31, 2011, our debt to total market capitalization approximated 61.6 percent (assuming conversion of all Common Operating Partnership Units to shares of common stock). Our debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately 7.0 years and a weighted average interest rate of 5.1 percent. Capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 included recurring capital expenditures of $8.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively. We are committed to the continued upkeep of our Properties and therefore do not expect a significant decline in our recurring capital expenditures during 2012.    45      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, CONTINUED   Net cash used for investing activities was $159.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The difference is due to increased acquisitions of $77.1 million, increased investment in property of $36.9 million, and decreased principal repayment on an officer’s notes and other notes receivable of $4.6 million, offset by increased proceeds related to disposition of assets of $0.8 million and increased dividend distribution from affiliate of $1.6 million,.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011; compared to $11.8 million net cash used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010. The difference is due to increased net proceeds received from the issuance of additional shares of $28.4 million, increased proceeds from issuance of other debt net of repayments on other debt of $50.2 million, increased net borrowings on the line of credit of $34.4 million, increased proceeds from stock option exercises of $0.6 million, and decreased payments to retire preferred operating partnership units of $0.9 million, offset by increased payments of deferred financing costs of $3.1 million and increased distributions to our stockholders and OP unitholders of $6.3 million due to equity issuances.   ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk. We mitigate this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage, minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures, which include the periodic use of derivatives. Our primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the effect variability interest rate changes could have on our future cash flows. We generally employ derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We have four derivative contracts consisting of two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $45.0 million, and two interest rate cap agreements with a notional amount of $162.4 million as of December 31, 2011. The first swap agreement fixes $25.0 million of variable rate borrowings at 5.60 percent through July 2012.  The second swap agreement fixes $20.0 million of variable rate borrowings at 3.04 percent through January 2014.  The first interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of 11.0 percent, a notional amount of $152.4 million, and a termination date of May 1, 2012.  The second interest rate cap agreement has a cap rate of 11.02 percent, a notional amount of $10.0 million, and a termination date of October 3, 2016.  Each of these derivative contracts is based upon 90-day LIBOR. Our remaining variable rate debt totals $322.8 million and $242.3 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which bear interest at Prime, various LIBOR or Fannie Mae Discounted Mortgage Backed Securities (“DMBS”) rates. If Prime, LIBOR, or DMBS increased or decreased by 1.0 percent during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we believe our interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $2.6 million and $2.4 million based on the $257.7 million and $244.2 million average balances outstanding under our variable rate debt facilities for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  A portion of our variable debt is floating on DMBS rates.  If the credit markets tighten, and there are fewer or no buyers of this security, the interest rate may be negatively impacted resulting in higher interest expense. 		</c>

The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the integration of our acquired technologies with our existing technology, the commercial launch of new products and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1: Business”; “Item 1A: Risk Factors”; “Item 6: Selected Financial Data”; and “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”   Overview   We develop, manufacture and sell products and services for genetic analysis to the life science research and clinical healthcare markets. Researchers around the world use our technology to better understand the role that genes play in disease, the effectiveness and safety of therapies and many other biological factors that affect human well-being. We sell our products to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies, as well as leading academic, government and not-for-profit research institutions and more than 24,000 peer-reviewed papers have been published based on work using our products. We have almost 900 employees worldwide and maintain sales and distribution operations across the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America.   We offer a comprehensive line of products for two principal applications: gene expression and genotyping. Our product sales consist primarily of sales of instruments and related consumables. We have three instrument systems, GeneTitan®, GeneChip® and GeneAtlas™, that include instruments, consumables and software. Our GeneChip® instruments run arrays packaged in cartridges and our GeneTitan® and GeneAtlas TM instruments run arrays packaged in a peg format.   We also offer a variety of assays for gene expression targeting low- to mid-plex markets that are downstream of our whole genome arrays and a range of reagent kits that are compatible with our platforms as well as the products of other vendors.   Overview of Fiscal Year 2011 and Strategic Initiatives   In 2011, our business was affected by a significant drop in the volume of sales of consumables to our academic and pharmaceutical customers, particularly in North America, which led to a decrease in revenue as compared to the same period in 2010. Primarily due to lower revenues from product sales, we incurred a net loss of $28.2 million for the year. Despite the lower revenues, we were able to generate cash flows from operations of almost $40 million in 2011.   Our focus remains on carrying out the following strategic initiatives:   Entering new markets and expanding our product lines. Our goal continues to be to expand our revenue base by entering new markets, growing our customer base and successfully commercializing our established and acquired technologies. In the future, we intend to continue to expand our focus to include the validation and routine testing markets which we believe offer attractive compound annual growth rates and opportunities for more recurring revenue growth in the future. We seek to expand our product line with new products that combine automated instrumentation, powerful new biological assays, and new array designs and content.      31 Table of Contents Improving operating leverage. We remain focused on improving our operating leverage and were successful in lowering our operating expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, increasing top-line revenue and sustained operating leverage.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES & ESTIMATES   General   The following section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   Our significant accounting policies are fully described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” However, certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.   REVENUE RECOGNITION   We enter into contracts to sell our products and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements, when and how to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized.   INVENTORIES   We enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products. The business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand. We perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period, which includes a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, product expiration and quality issues. Based on this analysis, we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete or impaired goods, when appropriate, in order to report inventory at net realizable value. These inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand, component costs, supplier arrangements, or product life cycles differ from our estimates. Any such adjustments would result in a charge to our results of operations .   NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES   As part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies, we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies. These investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost. We also invest in a limited partnership investment fund that is accounted for under the equity method. We periodically review our investments for impairment; however, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The analysis may include assessment of the investee’s (i) revenue and earnings trend, (ii) business outlook for its products and technologies, (iii) liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash, and (iv) likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing. If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value, we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired. We have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non-marketable investments over the past few years.      32 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES   Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. We believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in overall levels, character, or geographical mix of pretax earnings, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, future levels of research and development spending, nondeductible expenses, applicability of tax holidays, and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits.   The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $16.5 million. If recognized, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months.   We classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately $0.2 million for a total cumulative amount of $0.7 million of non-current income taxes payable as of December 31, 2011.   We file U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. During November 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 tax years and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, with no proposed adjustments. We consider all tax positions taken in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 tax years to be effectively settled, because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote possibility that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will re-examine the settled positions. As a result, we have released reserves of approximately $5.8 million related to uncertain tax positions for those periods and recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. However, the federal and California statute of limitations on assessment still remain open for the tax years 1992 through 2011. In significant foreign jurisdictions, the 2006 through 2011 tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities.   CONTINGENCIES   We are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters. Based on the information available at the balance sheet dates, we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably estimable, we will record a reserve which may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.   ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION   We account for employee share-based compensation by estimating the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock. We determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As required under the accounting rules, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee share-based awards granted in future periods.      33 Table of Contents US GAAP requires that employee share-based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period, or the vesting period, in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees. Accordingly, in 2011, we recognized employee share-based compensation of $8.8 million, which consisted of $1.1 million in cost of product sales, $1.9 million in research and development expense and $5.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2011, $16.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested employee stock awards is expected to be recognized as future cost of sales and operating expenses over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.   PRODUCT SALES   The components of product sales are as follows:   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Consumables   $ 224,972     $ 252,165     $ 255,660     $ (27,193 )   $ (3,495 )     (11 )%     (1 )% Instruments     16,301       25,578       23,526       (9,277 )     2,052       (36 )     9   Total product sales   $ 241,273     $ 277,743     $ 279,186     $ (36,470 )   $ (1,443 )     (13 )     (1 )   Total product sales decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to volume decreases. Chip volumes shipped were lower across all products while overall average selling price remained flat. Reagent revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume Genechip® shipments combined with lower average selling price caused by a shift in product mix. Instruments were lower due to fewer GeneTitan® sales partially offset by increased sales of the lower-priced GeneAtlas™.   Total product sales decreased $1.4 million or 1% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Consumables sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in the sales of our RNA reagents partially offset by an increase in sales of our DNA reagents. In both areas, sales of our lower price products have increased as a percentage of the total mix. Instrument sales grew in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the increased adoption of GeneTitan® and introduction of GeneAtlas TM families of instruments, which were introduced in late 2009 and early 2010, respectively, partially offset by declines in the volume of sales of older instruments.   SERVICES   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Services   $ 20,158     $ 20,565     $ 39,563     $ (407 )   $ (18,998 )     (2 )%     (48 )%   Total services revenue remained consistent in 2011 as compared to 2010 which was in line with our expectations.   Total services revenue decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the completion in late 2009 of several genotyping projects that began in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and the National Institutes of Health projects.      34 Table of Contents ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Royalties and other revenue   $ 6,043     $ 12,438     $ 8,345     $ (6,395 )   $ 4,093       (51 )%     49 %   Royalties and other revenue in 2010 was higher as compared to 2011 and 2009 primarily due to the receipt of a non-recurring $4.8 million license payment that was received in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to the non-recurring license payment, royalties and other revenue was lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to lower royalties and research activity.   PRODUCT AND SERVICES GROSS MARGINS   Dollars in thousands               Dollar/Point        Year ended December 31,     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009   Total gross margin on product sales   $ 143,458     $ 160,359     $ 152,809     $ (16,901 )   $ 7,550   Total gross margin on services     7,021       4,743       15,614       2,278       (10,871 )                                            Product gross margin as a percentage of product sales     59 %     58 %     55 %     1       3   Service gross margin as a percentage of services     35 %     23 %     39 %     12       (16 )   Despite lower product sales in 2011, product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased during the year as compared to 2010 primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products along with lower material, warranty and excess and obsolescence costs in 2011 as well as plant consolidation costs that occurred in 2010. These cost improvements were partially offset by lower cost absorption due to higher production levels in 2010. We note a downward trend in product gross margin within 2011 when comparing quarterly results driven by increased absorption cost due to lower sales.   Product gross margin increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in plant consolidation costs from $9.4 million in 2009 to $1.6 million in 2010, as the majority of the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure took place in 2009. Additionally, favorable pricing and absorption in chips contributed to the increased product margin. These increases were partially offset by higher excess and obsolescence costs for products with finite lives.   Service gross margin increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to costs associated with the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure that was completed in the second quarter of 2010. Service gross margin was lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and National Institutes of Health projects which had higher margins and were completed in 2009.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Research and development   $ 63,591     $ 67,934     $ 77,358     $ (4,343 )   $ (9,424 )     (6 )%     (12 )%   Research and development expenses decreased in 2011 and 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to savings in head count-related expenses and variable compensation of $3.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively and decreased spending on supplies of $2.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively as a result of cost-control measures. This was partially offset by an increase in facilities expenses primarily due to a one-time expense of $1.2 million related to the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara during the third quarter of 2011.      35 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Selling, general and administrative   $ 109,572     $ 114,773     $ 130,838     $ (5,201 )   $ (16,065 )     (5 )%     (12 )%   Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to lower legal expenses of $4.2 million as a result of a litigation settlement at the end of 2010. Other cost savings include variable compensation adjustments of $1.6 million, lower spending on consulting and other services of $1.5 million and advertising expenses of $0.8 million. These savings were partially offset by one-time severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer of $1.4 million, rent expense of $1.8 million primarily due to the acceleration of future lease payments as a result of the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara and acquisition costs of $2.9 million incurred on the anticipated eBioscience transaction.   In 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to 2009 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses of $11.0 million as a result of lower headcount and decreased variable compensation. Additionally, legal expenses decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to timing of legal proceedings with third-parties, consulting and purchased services decreased by $1.8 million as a result of various general and administrative cost reductions, and rent expense decreased by $1.4 million due primarily to the relocation of our Japan office and other site consolidation efforts.   INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET   The components of interest income and other, net, are as follows:   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Interest income   $ 2,627     $ 2,845     $ 4,455     $ (218 )   $ (1,610 )     (8 )%     (36 )% Realized loss on equity investments, net     (2,251 )     (4,342 )     (916 )     2,091       (3,426 )     48       (374 ) Currency loss, net     (2,483 )     (48 )     (2,800 )     (2,435 )     2,752       (5,073 )     98   Other     (4,195 )     58       1,850       (4,253 )     (1,792 )     (7,333 )     (97 ) Total interest income and other, net   $ (6,302 )   $ (1,487 )   $ 2,589     $ (4,815 )   $ (4,076 )     324       (157 )   Interest income and other, net decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the following:   ·   Realized loss on equity investments decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 as we recognized fewer other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”). In 2011, we recognized $2.1 million in OTTI on our non-marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund, a non-marketable investment in a private biotechnology company and an investment classified as available-for-sale in a publicly-traded company. In 2010, we recognized $5.6 million in OTTI on two non-marketable investments; ·   Currency loss, net, increased primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro in 2011 as compared to 2010; and ·   Other changed in 2011 due to a $2.2 million provision against a note receivable from a private biotechnology company and a $1.7 million impairment charge recorded against our West Sacramento facility during 2011.      36 Table of Contents Interest income and other, net changed by $4.1 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the following:   ·   Interest income decreased by $1.6 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the repurchase of a portion of our 3.50% convertible notes during 2010, partially offset by higher effective interest rates in 2010; ·   Realized loss in equity investments increased by $3.4 million in 2010 as we recognized $5.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment expense, largely as a result of our recognition of impairment charges on two non-marketable investments. This was partially offset by a net realized gain from our investment in a limited partnership investment fund of $1.3 million. In 2009, we recognized a net realized loss of $0.9 million primarily due to OTTI on our non-marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund; ·   Currency loss decreased in 2010 by $2.8 million due to favorable currency movements in 2010; and ·   Other income decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring sale of equipment in 2009 totaling $0.9 million.   INTEREST EXPENSE   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Interest expense   $ 3,813     $ 7,706     $ 10,945     $ (3,893 )   $ (3,239 )     (51 )%     (30 )%   Interest expense decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2009 primarily due to a lower aggregate principal balance of our 3.50 % convertible notes as a result of our repurchases totaling $151.7 million in aggregate principal amount during 2010. There were no further purchases in 2011.   INCOME TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT)   Dollars in thousands               Dollar     Percentage        Year ended December 31,     change from     change from        2011     2010     2009     2010     2009     2010     2009   Income tax provision (benefit)   $ 1,405     $ 2,170     $ (158 )   $ (765 )   $ 2,328       (35 )%     (1,473 )%   The income tax provision was approximately $1.4 million and $2.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, which consisted primarily of foreign taxes. The income tax benefit in 2009 of $0.2 million consisted of foreign taxes similar to 2011 and 2010 offset by refundable U.S. credits.   Deferred tax assets are recognized if realization of such assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2011, we provided for a valuation allowance of $154.1 million against our net deferred tax assets. As a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position, we have placed a full valuation allowance on U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income.   As of December 31, 2011, we had total net operating loss carryforwards of $288.6 million, comprised of $162.0 million for U.S. federal purposes, which expire in the years 2021 through 2031 if not utilized, and $126.6 million for state purposes, the majority of which expire in the years 2012 through 2031 if not utilized. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization.   During 2011, due to potential future transactions that would require cash outflows, we changed our assertion such that foreign earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a net deferred tax liability of approximately $0.8 million related to the foreign undistributed earnings, which was offset by a reduction in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.      37 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Liquidity   Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through product sales; sales of equity and debt securities such as our 3.50% convertible notes in 2007, collaborative agreements; interest income; licensing of our technology; and, when necessary, financing arrangements with third party creditors.   Our cash outflows have generally been as follows: cash used in operating activities such as research and development programs, sales and marketing activity, compensation and benefits of our employees and other working capital needs; cash paid for acquisitions; cash paid for litigation activity and settlements; and cash used for our debt repurchases and repurchases of our convertible notes as well as interest payments on our convertible notes obligations.   As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of approximately $265.1 million. We anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations, debt repayments or repurchases, and capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future.   These expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans, which are subject to change, and therefore we could require further funding. Factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include, but are not limited to: financing arrangements that we may enter into in connection with our acquisition of eBioscience or future acquisitions; a decline in cash generated by sales of our products and services; our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements; the progress of our research and development programs; initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; the purchase of patent licenses; and other factors.   On November 29, 2011, we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire eBioscience for approximately $330 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including our receipt of financing for the merger.   In connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for $190 million of senior secured credit. The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied, and as a result, we will not be able to complete the eBioscience acquisition unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured. We are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience regarding the possibility of restructuring the committed financing but no agreement or understandings have been reached. We have waived eBioscience’s obligations under the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement and we understand that eBioscience is considering alternatives to the merger. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing of the merger has not occurred by March 31, 2012, so long as a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate has not been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date.   On December 29, 2011, we received notice that Tang Capital Partners, LP, a holder of our 3.50% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2038 (the "Notes"), had commenced class action litigation against us in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint alleged a variety of claims relating to our proposed acquisition of eBioscience, including that the acquisition would constitute a Fundamental Change under the indenture governing the Notes. The complaint sought unspecified damages, temporary and permanent injunctive relief against completion of the eBioscience acquisition, and other remedies. On January 21, 2012, we entered into an agreement to settle the purported class action litigation. As part of the settlement, we agreed to commence a tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes at par plus accrued interest. Tang Capital Partners, LP, which owned approximately $78.3 million principal amount of the Notes, agreed to tender all of its Notes into the offer.      38 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital. To the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements; we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   From time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange convertible securities or common stock in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions, liquidity, and contractual obligations and other factors. We did not retire, repurchase or exchange any of our common stock or remaining outstanding convertible securities during the year ended December 31, 2011. As noted above, on February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes, to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer.

Adjustments for non-cash expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of $32.3 million, a net realized loss on investments of $4.8 million, which included other-than-temporary impairment charges totaling $2.1 million, a provision against a notes receivable from a private biotechnology company of $2.2 million, an impairment charge on property and equipment of $1.7 million and share-based compensation expense of $8.8 million.   Investing Activities   We liquidated a number of investments during the fourth quarter of 2011 to fund the anticipated eBioscience acquisition that resulted in a net inflow from investing activities from the purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities totaling $136.2 million during 2011. Our investing activities further included capital expenditures of $5.8 million and purchased technology rights of $3.2 million in 2011.   Financing Activities   Our financing activities generally consist of stock option exercise activity under our employee stock plan. Cash used in the issuance of stock under our employee stock plan, net of treasury shares withheld for taxes, was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.      39 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations   As of December 31, 2011, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows (in thousands):        Total     2012       2013-2014       2015-2016     After 2016   Senior convertible notes (1)   $ 95,469     $ 95,469     $ -     $ -     $ -   Interest payments (1)     557       557       -       -       -   Operating leases     65,420       8,315       14,621       10,622       31,862   Purchase commitments (2)     3,153       3,153       -       -       -   Total contractual obligations   $ 164,599     $ 107,494     $ 14,621     $ 10,622     $ 31,862     (1)   Our 3.50% senior convertible notes are due in 2038. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2013, 2018 and 2028. On February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20. Subsequent Events” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   (2)   Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Affymetrix and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.   The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16.5 million, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Income Taxes” for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.   ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of Affymetrix. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below.    Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges.   Interest Rate Risk   Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.   The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies and high-quality corporate issuers, and, by policy, restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits. To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years.      40 Table of Contents        Periods of Maturity           Fair Value at        2012     2013     2014     Thereafter     Total     December 31, 2011   ASSETS:                                     Available-for-sale securities   $ 7,821     $ 25,616     $ 18,179     $ 10,248     $ 61,864     $ 62,438   Average interest rate     1.2 %     3.0 %     3.5 %     3.5 %                 LIABILITIES:                                                 3.50% senior convertible notes due 2038 (1)   $ -     $ 95,469     $ -     $ -     $ 95,469     $ 95,469   Average interest rate             3.50 %                                 (1) In 2013, the security holders of our 3.50% senior convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. On February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20.

This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar or foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain or loss after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income, net, immediately.   The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our unsettled foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011. We had no unsettled hedging contracts at December 31, 2010. All contracts have maturities of 12 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2011 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands):              Weighted-                    Average              Notional     Settlement     Fair        Amount     Price     Value   Currency                   Euro     11,850       1.39       816   Japanese Yen     7,007       79.62       (216 ) British Pound     4,459       1.59       123   Total     23,316               723        41 Table of Contents 		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 47 Item 7 .                 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   The following is a discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  The Company is an Illinois corporation and is registered as a bank holding company with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.  The Company began active operations when it acquired the Bank, its sole subsidiary, on March 12, 2008.  The Company’s primary purpose is to own and operate the Bank.   The Bank provides community banking services, and its primary market is the greater Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area.   The Company and the Bank are subject to regulation by numerous agencies including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the IDFPR.  Among other things, these agencies limit the activities in which the Company and the Bank may engage, limit the investments and loans that the Bank may fund and set the amount of reserves against deposits that the Bank must maintain.   Critical Accounting Policies   Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry.  Critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to our financial position and results of operations.  Application of critical accounting policies requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments based on information available at the date of the financial statements that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Future changes in information may affect these estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which, in turn, may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.   These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the consolidated financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined.   Certain critical accounting policies involve estimates and assumptions by management.  To prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions based on available information.  Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has determined that our accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses, goodwill and intangible assets, and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to our financial      36 Table of Contents position and results of operations, and, as such, are considered to be critical accounting policies, as discussed below.   Allowance for Loan Losses.   The allowance for loan losses is charged to earnings as an estimate of probable losses.  Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.  Management periodically evaluates the loan portfolio in order to establish the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to absorb estimated losses that are probable.  This evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans where it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Also included are the loss estimates that reflect the current credit environment and that are not otherwise captured in the historical loss rates.  These include the quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, and current economic and industry conditions.  This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.  In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize adjustments to its allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examinations.   Goodwill and Intangible Assets .  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired that arose in the acquisition of Community Bank of Lawndale during March 2008.  Other intangible assets represent purchased assets from the acquisition of Community Bank of Lawndale during March 2008 that lack physical substance, but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights, or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability.   Goodwill is not amortized, but it is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.  In the event that the Company concludes that all or a portion of its goodwill may be impaired, a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded in earnings.   The impairment testing process is conducted by assigning net assets and goodwill to each reporting unit.  The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value, “step one.”  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and “step two” is not considered necessary.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the impairment test continues (“step two”) by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill.  The adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill.  An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying fair value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.   At December 31, 2009, the Company tested goodwill for impairment and found it to be fully impaired, which resulted in a charge of $1,186,000.  The Company considered projected discounted cash flows and price-to-tangible-book-value multiples in its analysis, as well as qualitative circumstances within the industry.  The Company attributed the impairment to continued weakened economic conditions and the resulting impact of market valuations of financial institutions.   Income Tax Accounting .  ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must meet to be recognized in the financial statements.  ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on measurement, recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company had no uncertain tax positions.  The application of income tax law is inherently complex.      37 Table of Contents Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous.  As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures.  Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time.  As such, changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.   Overview   The profitability of the Bank’s operations depends primarily on its net interest income, provision for loan losses, other income and other expenses.  Net interest income is the difference between the income the Bank receives on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds, which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  The provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the Bank’s loan portfolio.  Other income consists of service charges on deposit accounts, securities gains, Bank Enterprise Award grants and fees and commissions.  Other expenses include salaries and employee benefits, as well as occupancy and equipment expenses and other non-interest expenses.   Net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest-earning assets as compared to amounts of and rates on interest-bearing liabilities.  Net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest and the Bank’s asset/liability management procedures in coping with such changes.  The provision for loan losses is dependent on increases in the loan portfolio and management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions.  Other expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations and the cost of employees.  Growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs, supplies, postage and other miscellaneous expenses.   In an effort to grow the Bank and achieve some economies of scale, the Bank issued brokered CDs totaling $23.0 million in 2008 and $2.8 million in 2009, investing the funds in loans.  As the brokered CDs have matured, the Company has refinanced these deposits primarily with jumbo CDs.  Currently, jumbo CDs are a low-cost funding option to replace the brokered deposits that were used to grow the Bank.  Long term, the Company’s funding strategy is to grow core deposits through new business development and customer relationships.   The Company’s Chairman and CEO, William Winston, has stated on several occasions that he would like to see the Company serve as a significant financial services provider for the community, which primarily includes the west-side Chicago neighborhood of North Lawndale.  The Chairman believes small business lending will serve as a magnet for developing the community and providing jobs.  Due to its size, the Company may be unable to fill such a mission unless community development funds are found from other sources.  In the face of limited community development funds, the Company has the ability to continue its main line of lending, loans secured by residential real estate.   As of June 6, 2011, Covenant Bank must comply with the Consent Order issued by the FDIC and the IDFPR, respectively.  Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements includes a detailed review of the requirements of the documents.  Both the FDIC and the IDFPR will continually monitor the results of the Bank’s operations, including liquidity and capital, and, based on their assessment of the Bank’s ability to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, the FDIC and the IDFPR may take further actions including assumption of control of the Bank.  Additional actions taken by the Bank’s regulators may negatively impact the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.   In 2009, Covenant Bank entered into multiple MOUs with the FDIC and the IDFPR.  Under the terms of the MOUs, Covenant Bank agreed, among other things, to provide certain information to each supervisory authority including, but not limited to, a written plan for improved earnings, a written plan to improve liquidity and reduce dependency on volatile liabilities, a written capital plan, a formalized      38 Table of Contents compliance management program and written reports of progress.  Verbal discussions have been had with the regulators, and management is pursuing a capital-raising plan.   It should be noted that the Company’s Board of Directors has begun to investigate all strategic alternatives to enhance the stability of the Company, including a capital investment, sale, strategic merger or some form of restructuring.  There can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in this endeavor and be able to comply with the new regulatory requirements.  In addition, a transaction, which would likely involve equity financing, would result in substantial dilution to the Company’s current stockholders and could adversely affect the price of the Company’s common stock.   Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009   Total assets decreased $3.3 million, or 4.6 percent, to $68.2 million as of December 31, 2010 from $71.6 million as of December 31, 2009.  The decrease in total assets was primarily due to total loans decreasing to $54.6 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $56.9 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of 4.0 percent.  The Bank scaled back on loan production as it sought to retain capital.  Federal funds sold decreased from $2.7 million at December 31, 2009 to $1.1 million at December 31, 2010, as higher-costing time deposits matured and were not retained and excess funds were transferred to the investment portfolio.  The investment portfolio increased $900,000, or 20.9%, to $5.2 million at December 31, 2010, from $4.3 million at December 31, 2009.  The increase in securities is the result of the Bank’s decision to move historically low-yielding federal funds sold into higher-yielding government securities, increasing the yield on the funds by over 150 basis points.   Total deposits decreased $3.7 million, or 5.6 percent, to $62.9 million as of December 31, 2010, from $66.6 million as of December 31, 2009.  The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to the redemption of $8.5 million in maturing brokered CDs.  The redemption of $8.5 million in maturing brokered CDs allowed the Bank to extend the maturities of its time deposits and lowered the cost of these funds to the Bank by over 245 basis points.   Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009   General .  The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $1.1 million, compared to a net loss of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease in net loss was primarily the result of a $612,000 increase in net interest margin, a $221,000 increase in noninterest income and a $297,000 decrease in noninterest expense.   Return on average assets was negative 1.63 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to negative 2.74 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Return on average shareholders’ equity was negative 31.48 percent and negative 31.92 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009, respectively.  The ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was 4.98 percent and 5.42 percent, respectively.   Interest Income .  Interest income increased by $337,000, or 9.8 percent, to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in average total interest-earning assets of $5.5 million, or 9.2 percent, to $65.1 million at December 31, 2010, from $59.6 million at December 31, 2009, as well as a 19-basis-point increase in the average yield.  The average yield on interest-earning assets was 5.94 percent and 5.75 percent for 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Interest income on the loan portfolio was $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of $407,000.  The increase      39 Table of Contents was primarily due to a $6.1 million increase in average balances, as well as a 24 basis point increase in the yield on the portfolio.          Interest income on the investment portfolio decreased $68,000 due to a 70 basis point decrease in the yield on the portfolio as maturing securities were re-invested at market rates that have declined over the past 12 months, partially offset by a $800,000 increase in average balances.  Interest income on federal funds sold declined $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year period ended December 31, 2009, due mainly to a $1.3 million decrease in average balances, partially offset by a 1 basis point increase in yield.   Interest Expense .  Interest expense decreased $275,000, or 21.2 percent, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was due primarily to a 75 basis point, or 32.6 percent, decrease in the average rates paid on time deposits from 2.30 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 1.55 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, partially offset by a $5.2 million increase in average time deposit balances.  During the year period ended December 31, 2010, total average interest-bearing deposits increased $7.1 million to $62.9 million, an increase of 12.7 percent, from $55.8 million at December 31, 2009.  The $6.0 million decrease in time deposit balances was the result of the Bank’s decision to intentionally reduce its asset size in order to maintain capital to asset ratios in line with “well capitalized” standards.   In September 2009, the Company issued $792,000 in convertible debentures.  A majority of the funds received from the debentures were infused into the Bank for working capital purposes and to allow the Bank to execute its turnaround plan.  Interest expense on borrowings increased $36,000, to $47,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.   Net Interest Income .  Net interest income increased $612,000, or 33.8 percent, to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.   The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a $5.5 million increase in earning assets, primarily loans.  Additionally, net interest margin widened to 4.38 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 3.57 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The $5.5 million increase in total average interest-earning assets was funded primarily by an increase of $5.2 million in average time deposit balances.   Provision for Loan Losses .  The provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level management believes is adequate to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.   For the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009, the provision for losses on loans totaled $925,000 and $497,000, respectively, based on management’s estimate of probable losses.   As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s total nonperforming loans were $4.5 million, compared to $1.9 million total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2009.  The increase in non-performing assets was driven by a number of factors, which included job losses in the communities we serve, loss of tenants and a decrease in cash flow from the rental properties that collateralize a significant portion of our loan portfolio, and increased property tax burdens of our borrowers.      40 Table of Contents The allowance for loan losses was $1.6 million, or 2.93 percent of total loans and 35.5 percent of nonperforming loans, respectively, at December 31, 2010, as compared to $915,000, or 1.61 percent of total loans and 47.8 percent of nonperforming loans, respectively, at December 31, 2009.  As of December 31, 2010, the Bank believed its allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover probable losses.   Other Income .  Other income increased $221,000, or 28.4 percent, to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $779,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase was due mainly to a $170,000 increase in the Department of the Treasury’s Business Enterprise Award (BEA) to a total of $600,000, which are awarded to qualifying CDFI institutions based on lending in low to moderate income census tracts, and a $57,000 increase in gains on sale of securities, partially offset by a $100,000 increase in OREO expense and a $2,000 decrease in service charge income.   Other Expense .  Other expense decreased $297,000, or 7.0 percent, to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, from $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was due mainly to the $1.2 million goodwill impairment recorded in 2009 and a $28,000 increase in occupancy expense.  These were offset by increases in data processing expense of $34,000, salary and compensation of $164,000, deposit insurance premiums of $167,000, other expenses of $242,000 and professional fees of $254,000 in 2010.  The increase in data processing expense was the result of the Company buying out a processing contract as part of its plan to improve its ATM processing.  The increase in salary and compensation was the result of the full-year salaries and benefits of lending personnel hired in 2009 as the loan portfolio grew.  The increase in deposit insurance premiums was primarily due to the increase in deposit balances, as well as the FDIC raising the assessment rates to all banks.  The increase in other expenses was due to consultants and operational charge-offs.  The increase in professional fees was due to the Company incurring additional fees related to its initial registration as an SEC reporting company and the creation of a capital restoration plan.   Income Taxes Expense (Benefits) .  Because the Bank and the Company have incurred losses, and remain in a loss position, the Bank and the Company have established a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset balance.   Comparison of Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2009 and the Period from Inception (March 12, 2008) to December 31, 2008   General .  The Company’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $1.8 million, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  The increase in net loss was primarily the result of the write-down of $1.2 million of impaired goodwill, partially offset by a $900,000 increase in the net interest margin.  The Company considered projected discount cash flows and price-to-tangible-book-value multiples in its goodwill analysis, as well as quantitative circumstances within the industry.  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired which arose in the acquisition of Community Bank of Lawndale during March 2008.   Return on average assets was negative 2.74 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to negative 3.75 percent for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  Return on average shareholders’ equity was negative 31.92 percent and negative 23.29 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009 and for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008, respectively.  The ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was 5.42 percent and 9.33 percent, respectively.   Interest Income .  Interest income increased by $1.8 million, or 112.5 percent, to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.6 million for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to      41 Table of Contents December 31, 2008.  The increase in interest income resulted primarily from an increase in average total interest-earning assets of $15.4 million, or 34.8 percent, to $59.6 million at December 31, 2009, from $44.2 million at December 31, 2008, as well as a 203 basis point increase in the average yield.  The average yield on interest earning assets was 5.75 percent and 3.72 percent for 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Interest income on the loan portfolio was $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to $826,000 for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008, an increase of $2.4 million.  The increase was primarily due to a $38.2 million increase in average balances, partially offset by a 6 basis point decrease in the yield on the portfolio.  The increase in interest income was due in part to a shorter reporting period, beginning with the purchase of the Bank on March 12, 2008.  On an annualized basis, the Bank believes that the interest income for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been approximately $1.0 million.   Interest income on the investment portfolio increased $3,000 due to a 44 basis point increase in the yield on the portfolio, partially offset by a $520,000 decrease in average balances.  The investment portfolio balances were reduced as the Bank increased its lending balances in 2010, lowering the amount deployed in the investment portfolio.  Interest income on federal funds sold declined $67,000 due to a $2.0 million decrease in average balances as well as a 139 basis point drop in yield as the federal funds target rate dropped to 0.25% for most of the year.  Interest on deposits in other financial institutions decreased $524,000, primarily due to the decrease in stock subscription escrow balances upon the issuance of stock used in the acquisition of the Bank.   Interest Expense .  Interest expense on deposits increased $882,000, or 220.0 percent, to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $401,000 for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  The increase was due to a $36.4 million increase in average total interest-bearing deposits from $19.4 million at December 31, 2008 to $55.8 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of 187.6 percent.  In addition, there was a 24 basis point, or 11.7 percent, increase in the average rates paid on deposits from 2.06 percent for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008, compared to 2.30 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The increase in interest expense was due in part to a shorter reporting period, beginning with the purchase of the Bank on March 12, 2008.  On an annualized basis, the Company believes that the interest expense would have been approximately $507,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Net Interest Income .  Net interest income increased $914,000, or 75.0 percent, to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $1.2 million for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.   The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from an increase in net interest margin to 3.57 percent for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 3.42 percent for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  The increase in net interest income was due in part to a shorter reporting period, beginning with the purchase of the Bank on March 12, 2008.  On an annualized basis, the company believes that the net interest income would have been approximately $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.   Provision for Loan Losses .  The provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate by management to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio.  In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations.      42 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2009 and for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008, the provision for losses on loans totaled $497,000 and $347,000, respectively, based on management’s estimate of probable losses.   As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s total nonperforming loans were $1.92 million, compared to $689,000 total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2008.  The increase in non-performing assets was driven by a number of factors, which included job losses in the communities we serve, loss of tenants and a decrease in cash flow from the rental properties that collateralize a significant portion of our loan portfolio, and increased property tax burdens of our borrowers.   The allowance for loan losses was $915,000, or 1.61 percent of total loans and 47.8 percent of nonperforming loans, respectively, at December 31, 2009, as compared to $467,000, or 1.18 percent of total loans and 67.8 percent of nonperforming loans, respectively, at December 31, 2008.  As of December 31, 2009, the Bank believed its allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover probable losses.   Other Income .  Other income increased $506,000, or 185.3 percent, to $779,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $273,000 for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  The increase was due mainly to a $412,000 increase in the BEA grant obtained, to a total of $429,905.   Other Expense .  Other expense increased $2.0 million, or 87.0 percent, to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, from $2.3 million for the period from inception, March 12, 2008, to December 31, 2008.  On an annualized basis, the Company believes other expenses for the period ended December 31, 2008 would have been $2.9 million.  The increase was due mainly to a $1.2 million write-down of impaired goodwill and a $396,000 increase in personnel costs as the Company’s turnaround plan required the hiring of multiple executives to execute the plan as well as a $252,000 increase in other expenses, including a $45,000 increase in FDIC premiums with the increase in deposit accounts and a $52,000 increase in consultant fees used in outsourcing non-core business processes.   Income Taxes Expense (Benefits) .  Because the Bank and the Company have incurred losses, and remain in a loss position, the Bank and the Company have established a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset balance.   Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Rates   The following table sets forth the average balances, net interest income, and expenses and average yields for interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the indicated periods.  No tax equivalent adjustments were made because the Company does not receive tax-exempt income.  All average balances are daily average balances.  Non-accruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield.  Included in loan interest income are loan fees of $73,000 and $32,000 for the periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as well as $32,000 and $1,000 for the periods ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,

table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-related assets and liabilities have affected the Bank’s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.  For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior year rate), (2) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior year volume) and (3) total change in rate and volume.  The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been

Accounting Pronouncements   Refer to Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.   Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices   The financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K regarding the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation.  Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the Company’s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature.  As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity.   Liquidity management is the process by which the Company ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet the present and future cash flow obligations arising from the daily operations of the business.  These financial obligations consist of needs for funds to meet commitments to borrowers for extension of credit, funding capital expenditures, withdrawals by customers, maintaining deposit reserve requirements, servicing debt, and paying operating expenses.   The Company believes that it achieves a satisfactory degree of liquidity through actively managing both assets and liabilities.  Asset management guides the proportion of liquid assets to total      45 Table of Contents assets, while liability management monitors future funding requirements and prices liabilities accordingly.   Our primary sources of liquidity are deposits, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank, amortization and prepayment of loans, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations.  While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.  We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits.  In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning investments and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.  Short-term interest-earning deposits with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago amounted to $3,000 at December 31, 2010 and $63,000 at December 31, 2009.  For additional information about cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities, see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in the consolidated financial statements.   A significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities.  Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans and increases in deposit accounts, along with advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.   Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.  If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.  At December 31, 2010, we had $1.3 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.   At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding loan commitments of $1,091,000.  This amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process.  At December 31, 2010, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled $18.7 million.  Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case.  In addition, the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment.   Capital.    The Company is pursuing additional capital.  Immediate capital is needed as the ongoing viability of the Company is threatened.  The Company is currently seeking investment to be able to inject additional capital in the Bank to meet the requirements of the Order; however, no assurances can be made that such efforts will be successful.  On May 31, 2010, the Company received shareholder approval to authorize and issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and up to 9,000,000 additional shares of common stock.   Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements.   Commitments .  As a financial services provider, we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby and commercial letters of credit.  While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon.  Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us.   Contractual Obligations .  In the ordinary course of operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations.  Such obligations include the funding of operations through debt issuances, operating leases for premises and equipment, as well as capital expenditures for new premises and equipment.        46 Table of Contents   The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other potential funding needs at December 31, 2010:        December 31, 2010        Less than 1 Year     1-3 Years     3-5 Years     More

  $ 1,427     $ 70     $ —     $ 95     $ 1,592   Asset and Liability Management   The primary functions of asset and liability management are to ensure adequate liquidity and the maintenance of an appropriate balance between interest-sensitive earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Liquidity management involves the ability to meet cash flow requirements of depositors wishing to withdraw funds, and borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs.  Interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates.  The Company’s objective is to manage its assets and liabilities to provide optimum and stable net interest margin while avoiding any undue interest rate risk.  The Company’s funds management strategy is to provide adequate returns, as well as sufficient liquidity.   Item 7A .                 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   The Company’s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk.  Interest rate risk is the exposure of a banking organization’s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates.   The Company analyzes its interest rate sensitivity.  Interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that either re-price or mature within a given period of time.   A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate-sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest-rate-sensitive assets.   Interest rate sensitivity varies with different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Overnight federal funds on which rates change daily and loans that are tied to prime or other short-term indices differ considerably from long-term investment securities and fixed-rate loans.  Similarly, time deposits are much more interest-sensitive than savings accounts.  The shorter-term interest rate sensitivities are key to measuring the interest sensitivity gap or excess interest-earning assets over interest-bearing liabilities.  Management of interest sensitivity involves matching repricing dates of interest-earning assets with interest-bearing liabilities in a manner designed to optimize net interest income within the limits imposed by the Company’s Board of Directors, liquidity determinations and capital considerations.  The following Interest Rate Sensitivity Gaps table sets forth the earliest repricing distribution of the Bank’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2010, the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity gap ratio (i.e., excess of interest rate-sensitive assets over interest rate-sensitive liabilities, divided by total assets) and the Bank’s cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio.  For purposes of the table, except for savings deposits, an asset or liability is considered rate-sensitive      47 Table of Contents within a specified period when it matures or could be repriced within such period in accordance with its contractual terms.  At December 31, 2010, an asset-sensitive position is maintained on a cumulative basis through one year of 6.59%.  Generally, because of the positive gap position of the Bank, in shorter time frames, the Bank can anticipate that increases in market rates will have a positive impact on the net interest income, while decreases will have the opposite effect.  In the current low interest rate environment, this positive gap position creates margin compression.  Management has minimized the impact by shifting excess funds to commercial loan originations that are fixed for at least five years and by reducing the interest rates it pays on interest-bearing deposit products.   Generally, during a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap within shorter maturities would adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income, and during a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap within shorter maturities would result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap within shorter maturities would have the opposite effect.   The following table sets forth the static rate-sensitivity analysis of the Company as of December 31, 2010:        Interest rate sensitivity gaps as of December 31, 2010   (Dollars in Thousands)   3 months or less     Over 3  through 12

Earning Assets     -2.71 %     6.59 %     -5.26 %     4.71 %     5.55 %         For purpose of the gap analysis, 50% of such deposits (savings, MMDA and NOW), which do not have definitive maturity dates and do not readily react to changes in interest rates have been placed in longer repricing intervals versus immediate repricing time frames, making the analysis more reflective of the Bank’s historical experience.   The foregoing table shows a negative (liability-sensitive) rate-sensitivity gap for the 3 months or less and over 1 year through 3 years categories, with a positive (asset-sensitive) rate sensitivity for all other categories.  The negative gaps in the 3 months or less and over 1 year through 3 years categories      48 Table of Contents result from having more liabilities subject to repricing during that particular time period than assets subject to repricing during the same time period.  In all other time frames, the volume of assets subject to repricing exceeds the volume of liabilities subject to repricing, resulting in a positive gap.  On a cumulative basis, which assumes that as assets and liabilities are repriced, they are either retained in the same category or replaced by instruments with similar characteristics, the gap is liability sensitive in the 3 months or less and over 1 year through 3 years categories.  The Company’s cumulative asset-sensitive gap structure in the 1 year category (which is the time frame the Company devotes most of its attention to in its funds management function) will allow net interest margin to grow if interest rates increase during that time frame, as yields on interest-earning assets would increase at a faster pace than the costs on interest-bearing liabilities.  The difference, or the interest rate repricing “gap,” provides an indication of how the Company’s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates.   While using the interest sensitivity gap analysis is a useful management tool, as it considers the quantity of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in a given time period, it does not consider the relative sensitivity to market interest rate changes that is characteristic of various interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities.  Consequently, even though the Bank currently has a positive gap position because of unequal sensitivity of these assets and liabilities, management believes this position will not materially impact earnings in a changing rate environment.  For example, changes in the prime rate on variable commercial loans may not result in an equal change in the rate of money market deposits or short-term certificates of deposit.  A simulation model is therefore used to estimate the impact of various changes, both upward and downward, in market interest rates and volumes of assets and liabilities on the net income of the Bank.  The calculated net interest income or “earnings” at risk at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:        December 31, 2010          -300       -200       -100       -50       +50       +100       +200       +300        (dollars in thousands)   Dollar Change   $ (806 )   $ (447 )   $ (139 )   $ (38 )   $ 40     $ 66     $ 121     $ 185   Percentage Change     -24.1 %     -13.4 %     -4.1 %     -1.1 %     1.2 %     2.0 %     3.6 %     5.5 %      December 31, 2009          -300       -200       -100       -50       +50       +100       +200       +300        (dollars in thousands)   Dollar Change   $ (978 )   $ (472 )   $ (136 )   $ (60 )   $ 7     $ 8     $ 17     $ 28   Percentage Change     (26.5 %)     (12.8 %)     (3.7 %)     (1.6 %)     0.2 %     0.2 %     0.5 %     0.8 % The estimated impact to our net interest income over a one-year period is reflected in dollar terms and percentage change.  As an example, this table illustrates that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of +100 basis points on December 31, 2010, net interest income would increase by $66,000, or 2.0 percent, over a one-year period.   The assumptions used in evaluating the vulnerability of the Bank’s earnings to changes in interest rates are based on management’s consideration of past experience, current position and anticipated future economic conditions.  The interest sensitivity of the Bank’s assets and liabilities, as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on the earnings and equity, could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the assumptions on which the calculations were based.  In today’s uncertain economic times, the result of the Bank’s simulation model is even more uncertain.      49 Table of Contents 		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     32                   ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Forward-looking Statements:   The following discussion contains statements that refer to future expectations, contain projections of the results of operations or of financial condition, or state other information that is “forward-looking.” “Forward-looking” statements are easily identified by the use of words such as “could,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” and similar words that refer to a future outlook. There is always a degree of uncertainty associated with “forward-looking” statements. MVB’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of these disclosures. Actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated.       10     Table of Contents      Many factors could cause MVB’s actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Some factors, which could negatively affect the results, include:             •     General economic conditions, either nationally or within MVB’s market, could be less favorable than expected;           •     Changes in market interest rates could affect interest margins and profitability;           • •     Competitive pressures could be greater than anticipated;           •     Legal or accounting changes could affect MVB’s results; and           •     Adverse changes could occur in the securities and investments markets.   In Management’s Discussion and Analysis we review and explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for MVB Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries. We have designed this discussion to assist you in understanding the significant changes in MVB’s financial condition and results of operations. We have used accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to prepare the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We engaged S.R. Snodgrass, A.C. to audit the consolidated financial statements and their independent audit report is included herein.       11     Table of Contents        Introduction   The following discussion and analysis of the Consolidated Financial Statements of MVB is presented to provide insight into management’s assessment of the financial results and operations of MVB. MVB Bank, Inc. is the sole operating subsidiary of MVB and all comments, unless otherwise noted, are related to the Bank. You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the ratios and statistics contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K.   Application of Critical Accounting Policies   MVB’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When third-party information is not available, valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal forecasting techniques.   The most significant accounting policies followed by the Bank are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in management’s discussion and analysis of operations, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.   The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of losses inherent in classifications of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience of peer banks, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Non-homogeneous loans are specifically evaluated due to the increased risks inherent in those loans. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type in the consolidated balance sheet. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the Allowance for Loan Losses section of this financial review.   See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for MVB’s policy regarding the other than temporary impairment of investment securities.       12     Table of Contents        Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments   In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring . The amendments in this Update provide additional guidance or clarification to help creditors in determining whether a creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties for purposes of determining whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring. The amendments in this Update are effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning on or after June 15, 2011, and should be applied retrospectively to the beginning annual period of adoption. As a result of applying these amendments, an entity may identify receivables that are newly considered impaired. For purposes of measuring impairment of those receivables, an entity should apply the amendments prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011. The Company has provided the necessary disclosures in Note 3.   In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-03, Transfers and Services (Topic 860): Reconsideration of Effective Control for Repurchase Agreements . The main objective in developing this Update is to improve the accounting for repurchase agreements (repos) and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity. The amendments in this Update remove from the assessment of effective control (1) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, both public and nonpublic. The amendments affect all entities that enter into agreements to transfer financial assets that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem the financial assets before their maturity. The guidance in this Update is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date. Early adoption is not permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The amendments in this Update result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. Consequently, the amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. The amendments in this Update are to be applied prospectively. For public entities, the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. Early application by public entities is not permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The amendments in this Update improve the comparability, clarity, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. To increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of U.S. GAAP and IFRS, the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity was eliminated. The amendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. All entities that report items of comprehensive income, in any period presented, will be affected by the changes in this Update. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012, and interim and annual periods thereafter. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.       13     Table of Contents        In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other Topics (Topic 350), Testing Goodwill for Impairment . The objective of this update is to simplify how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in the Update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. Under the amendments in this Update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities, both public and nonpublic, that have goodwill reported in their financial statements and are effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before September 15, 2011, if an entity’s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or, for nonpublic entities, have not yet been made available for issuance. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Multiemployer Plans (Subtopic 715-80): Disclosures about an Employer’s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan . The amendments in this Update will require additional disclosures about an employer’s participation in a multiemployer pension plan to enable users of financial statements to assess the potential cash flow implications relating to an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans. The disclosures also will indicate the financial health of all of the significant plans in which the employer participates and assist a financial statement user to access additional information that is available outside the financial statements. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements .   In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-10, Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Derecognition of in Substance Real Estate-a Scope Clarification. The amendments in this Update affect entities that cease to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary's nonrecourse debt. Under the amendments in this Update, when a parent (reporting entity) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary's nonrecourse debt, the reporting entity should apply the guidance in Subtopic 360-20 to determine whether it should derecognize the in substance real estate. Generally, a reporting entity would not satisfy the requirements to derecognize the in substance real estate before the legal transfer of the real estate to the lender and the extinguishment of the related nonrecourse indebtedness. That is, even if the reporting entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest under Subtopic 810-10, the reporting entity would continue to include the real estate, debt, and the results of the subsidiary's operations in its consolidated financial statements until legal title to the real estate is transferred to legally satisfy the debt. The amendments in this Update should be applied on a prospective basis to deconsolidation events occurring after the effective date. Prior periods should not be adjusted even if the reporting entity has continuing involvement with previously derecognized in substance real estate entities. For public entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after June 15, 2012. For nonpublic entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2013, and interim and annual periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements .       14     Table of Contents        In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities . The amendments in this Update affect all entities that have financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either (1) offset in accordance with either Section 210-20-45 or Section 815-10-45 or (2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The requirements amend the disclosure requirements on offsetting in Section 210-20-50. This information will enable users of an entity's financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity's financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments in the scope of this Update. An entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.    In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 . In order to defer only those changes in Update 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments, the paragraphs in this Update supersede certain pending paragraphs in Update 2011-05. Entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before Update 2011-05. All other requirements in Update 2011-05 are not affected by this Update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements. Public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2012, and interim and annual periods thereafter. This ASU is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements .   Summary Financial Results   MVB earned $2.7 million in 2011 compared to $2.2 million in 2010, an increase of $465,000. The earnings equated to a 2011 return on average assets of .57% and a return on average equity of 6.69%, compared to prior year results of .57% and 7.98%, respectively. Basic earnings per share were $1.24 in 2011 compared to $1.40 in 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $1.21 in 2011 compared to $1.36 in 2010. The most significant factor in the increase in 2011 profitability was a 3.3 million increase in net interest income. This increase was largely the result of the following: a reduction in net interest expense of $570,000 despite deposit growth of $90.1 million, the result of a decrease in interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities; the increase in net interest and fees on loans of $3.0 million which was the result of loan growth of $79.8 million in 2011 and an increase in interest on investment securities of $112,000, the result of the investment portfolio increasing by $43.6 million in 2011. Other income increased $1.2 million. This increase was the result of several items, mostly a $745,000 increase in gain on sale of investments. Other items of significance were as follows: income on loans held for sale increased $323,000 due to increased volume and the sale of one large USDA secured commercial loan at a significant gain; Visa debit card income increased by $53,000, the result of increased debit card usage by MVB customers and other income increased by $89,000, the result of a $150,000 increase in mortgage underwriting income, a $51,000 increase in title insurance income and a $134,000 decrease in income from the sale of other real estate owned. Other operating expenses increased by $3.2 million. The most significant item relating to this increase was increased salaries and benefits of $1.9 million due to the addition of the Morgantown office, a compliance officer, additions to the information technology staff and newly formed operations center staff, a full year of expense on three commercial lenders added in mid 2010 and increases for existing staff. Other noteworthy areas of increase were as follows: legal expense increased $465,000, the result of a lawsuit began when the Morgantown office was formed; consulting expense increased $197,000, driven by increased usage of the MVChecking and MVSavings products as well as various special projects undertaken throughout the year; advertising increased $144,000, $96,000 of which was in the Morgantown area; equipment expense increased $122,000, $41,000 of which was in the new Morgantown office and $16,000 at the newly formed operations center and finally occupancy expense increased $107,000, $68,000 of which was attributable to the Morgantown office and $42,000 at the operations center.       15     Table of Contents        MVB’s yield on earning assets in 2011 was 4.28% compared to 4.42% in 2010. This decrease in yield is attributable to the following: a 29 basis point decline in the yield on loans and a 70 basis point decline in the investment portfolio. Despite extensive competition, total loans increased to $373.8 million at December 31, 2011, from $294.0 million at December 31, 2010. The Bank’s ability to originate quality loans is supported by a minimal delinquency rate. The decrease in yield on the investment portfolio is attributable to increasing the portfolio’s size by $43.6 million or 63% from 2010, all of which was done at rates significantly lower than the existing portfolio.   Deposits increased $90.1 million to $390.5 million at December 31, 2011, from $300.4 million at December 31, 2010, due to the following: $20.7 million in growth from CDARS and other brokered funds, $37.8 million in broker buster checking, $14.8 million in MVChecking and MVSavings combined deposits and $22.6 million in additional public funds monies. MVB offers an uncomplicated product design accompanied by a simple fee structure that is attractive to customers. The overall cost of funds for the bank was 1.25% in 2011 compared to 1.66% in 2010. This cost of funds, combined with the earning asset yield, resulted in a net interest margin of 3.17% in 2011 compared to 2.94% in 2010.   The Bank maintained a high-quality, short-term investment portfolio during 2011 to provide liquidity in the balance sheet, to fund loan growth, for repurchase agreements and to provide security for state and municipal deposits.   Interest Income and Expense   Net interest income is the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and certificates of deposit in other banks. Interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds such as sweep accounts and repurchase agreements. Net interest income remains the primary source of revenue for MVB. Net interest income is also impacted by changes in market interest rates, as well as the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is also impacted favorably by increases in non-interest bearing demand deposits and equity.   Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets and serves as a measurement of the net revenue stream generated by MVB’s balance sheet. As noted above, the net interest margin was 3.17% in 2011 compared to 2.94% in 2010. The net interest margin continues to face considerable pressure due to competitive pricing of loans and deposits in MVB’s markets. During 2011, the Federal Reserve did not change rates and in fact committed to keep rates low through mid 2013. Management’s estimate of the impact of future changes in market interest rates is shown in the section captioned “Interest Rate Risk.”   Management continues to analyze methods to deploy MVB’s assets into an earning asset mix which will result in a stronger net interest margin. Loan growth continues to be strong and management anticipates that loan activity will remain strong in the near term future.       16     Table of Contents        During 2011, net interest income increased by $3.3 million or 30.4% to $14.1 million from $10.8 million in 2010. This increase is largely due to the growth in average earning assets, primarily $73.6 million in loans and $31.4 million in investments. Average total earning assets were $444.6 million in 2011 compared to $368.1 million in 2010. Average total loans grew to $334.7 million in 2011 from $261.1 million in 2010. Primarily as a result of this growth, total interest income increased by $2.7 million, or 16.7%, to $19.0 million in 2011 from $16.3 million in 2010. Average interest-bearing liabilities, mainly deposits, likewise increased in 2011 by $62.2 million. Average interest-bearing deposits grew to $314.7 million in 2011 from $263.6 million in 2010. Total interest expense decreased by $570,000 despite the $62.2 million in average interest bearing liabilities growth. This decrease in interest expense was the result of a 41 basis point decrease in interest cost from 2010 to 2011.   MVB’s yield on earning assets changed during 2011 as follows: The loan portfolio yield decreased by 29 basis points and MVB’s investment portfolio yield decreased by 70 basis points while funding yields decreased by 41 basis points.   The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.25% in 2011 from 1.66% in 2010. This decrease is primarily the result of reduced cost of funds as follows: Certificates of deposit costs decreased 52 basis points, IRA costs decreased 29 basis points, Repurchase agreement costs decreased 26 basis points and NOW accounts costs decreased 31 basis points.       17     Table of Contents        Statistical Financial Information Regarding MVB Financial Corp.   The following tables

approximately $1.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. This increase principally relates to the increase in loans outstanding.   Determining the appropriate level of the Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL) requires considerable management judgment. In exercising this judgment, management considers numerous internal and external factors including, but not limited to, portfolio growth, national and local economic conditions, trends in the markets served and guidance from the Bank’s primary regulators. Management seeks to maintain an ALL that is appropriate in the circumstances and that complies with applicable accounting and regulatory standards. Further discussion can be found later in this discussion under ‘Allowance for Loan Losses.”   Non-Interest Income   Fees related to deposit accounts and cash management accounts and income on loans held for sale represent a significant portion of the Bank’s primary non-interest income. The total of non-interest income for 2011 was $3.7 million versus $2.5 million in 2010.   The most significant increase in non-interest income from 2011 to 2010 was $745,000 in gains on the sale of investment securities. Other items of significance were as follows: income on loans held for sale increased $323,000, other income increased by $89,000 and Visa debit card income increased by $53,000   The Bank is constantly searching for new non-interest income opportunities that enhance income and provide customer benefits.   Non-Interest Expense   Non-interest Expense was $12.4 million in 2011 versus $9.1 million in 2010. Approximately 54% and 52% of non-interest expense for 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to personnel costs. Personnel are the lifeblood of every service organization, which is why personnel cost, is such a significant part of the expenditure mix. Salaries and benefits increased by $1.9 million in 2011, the result of the addition of the Morgantown office, a compliance officer, information technology staff, operations center staff, an entire year of expense relating to the commercial loan staff added midway through 2010 and increases for existing staff.   Legal expense increased by $465,000, the result of a lawsuit brought about through the addition of the Morgantown office. This claim was settled in February of 2012 and the Company had adequately accrued for all expenses related to the claim as of December 31, 2011.   Consulting expense increased by $197,000 in 2011. This increase related to the increased usage of consultants in the area of strategic planning and the continued development of our MVChecking and MVSavings products through BankVue.   Advertising increased by $144,000, $96,000 of which related to the Morgantown office.   Equipment and occupancy expense increased by $122,000 and $107,000 respectively. These increases were mainly the result of the addition of the Morgantown office and the operations center.   Other operating expense increased by $335,000. This increase was driven by a $118,000 increase in travel and entertainment, an $83,000 increase in collections expense, a $40,000 increase in directors’ fees, a $27,000 increase in telephone expense and a $24,000 increase in training expense.       20     Table of Contents        2010 compared to 2009   Net interest income increased by $2.0 million when comparing 2010 with 2009 results. This increase is largely due to growth in average earning assets, primarily loans, of $61.2 million in 2010. Average interest-bearing liabilities, mainly deposits, increased by $70.9 million in 2010. This increase was due mainly to the continued success of two products, the broker buster account designed to take back money lost to brokerage firms and MVChecking, a higher rate checking account designed to reward customer behaviors that increase the bank’s revenue stream   A large portion of non-interest income is comprised of fees related to deposit accounts and cash management accounts. Non-interest income was $2.5 million in 2010 compared to $2.2 million in 2009. This increase was due primarily to increased usage of the MVChecking account which provided $74,000 more in Visa debit card income, $64,000 in gains on the sale of other real estate owned and $88,000 in gains on the sale of investment securities.   Non-interest expense reached $9.1 million in 2010 compared to $8.3 million in 2009. This increase was the result of the following: $555,000 increase in salaries and benefits, $136,000 in increased consulting expenses, $79,000 in additional FDIC insurance expense and $57,000 in increased Visa debit card expense.   Income Taxes   MVB incurred income tax expense of $1.0 million in 2011 and $795,000 in 2010.   The effective tax rate was 27% in 2011 and 26% 2010.   Return on Assets   MVB’s return on average assets was .57% in 2011, .57% in 2010 and .45% in 2009.   Return on Equity   MVB’s return on average stockholders’ equity (“ROE”) was 6.69% in 2011, compared to 7.98% in 2010 and 5.26% in 2009. The decreased return in 2011 is a direct result of the addition of $17 million in capital from a stock offering to accredited investors and the addition of SBLF money.   Overview of the Statement of Condition   The MVB balance sheet changed significantly from 2010 to 2011. Investments increased $43.6 million. Loans increased by $79.8 million to $373.8 million at December 31, 2011. Deposits increased by $90.1 million, repurchase agreements increased by $30.2 million, FHLB borrowings decreased by $18.8 million and stockholders’ equity increased by $17.0 million.   Cash and Cash Equivalents   MVB’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $9.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2010. This increase was due to the fact that MVB added Compass Bank as a correspondent during 2011 and transferred roughly $5 million in funds from an interest earning account at the Federal Reserve to a non interest bearing account at Compass which provided an earnings credit of 75 basis points toward the elimination of service charges.       21     Table of Contents        Management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents adequately serves MVB’s liquidity and performance needs. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and other liquidity demands. Management believes the liquidity needs of MVB are satisfied by the current balance of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and non-traditional funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that mature within one year. These sources of funds should enable MVB to meet cash obligations as they come due.   Investment Securities   Investment securities totaled $112.9 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $69.3 million at December 31, 2010. This $43.6 million increase is the result of increased repurchase agreement balances and public fund deposits that require collateralization.   MVB’s investment securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale. Management believes the available-for-sale classification provides flexibility for MVB in terms of managing the portfolio for liquidity, yield enhancement and interest rate risk management opportunities. At December 31, 2011, the amortized cost of MVB’s investment securities totaled $112.2 million, resulting in unrealized gain in the investment portfolio of $1.3 million.   Management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) meetings. The ALCO also monitors net interest income and manages interest rate risk for MVB. Through active balance sheet management and analysis of the investment securities portfolio, MVB maintains sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor requirements and the various credit needs of its customers. Management believes the risk characteristics inherent in the investment portfolio are acceptable based on these parameters.   The Company evaluated its holding of Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) stock for impairment and deemed the stock to not be impaired due to the expected recoverability of the par value, which equals the value reflected within the Company’s financial statements. The decision was based on several items ranging from the estimated true economic losses embedded within the FHLB’s mortgage portfolio to the FHLB’s liquidity position and credit rating. The Company utilizes the impairment framework outlined in paragraph 8(i) of SOP 01-06 and paragraphs 12.21 – 12.25 of the AICPA Audit Guide for Depository and Lending Institutions to evaluate FHLB stock for impairment. The following factors were evaluated to determine the ultimate recoverability of the par value of the FHLB stock holding.             a.     The significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount for the FHLB and the length of time this situation has persisted.                                   The suspension of stock redemptions and dividend payments will provide the FHLB with the means to build capital.  This will reduce the likelihood that any owner of FHLB stock will ultimately incur a loss in the future.  In addition, the FHLB’s historical ability and commitment to holding investments until maturity is projected to reduce the unrealized loss within the mortgage portfolio from $13.5 billion to an estimated embedded economic loss of less than $1 billion, which will further enhance capital and the ultimate recoverability of the par value of stock.       22     Table of Contents                  b.     Commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the FHLB.                                   The Company is not aware of any significant/unusual commitments made by the FHLB that would impact future financial performance, dividend rates, or the ultimate recoverability of the stock holding at par value.                             c.     The impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the institutions and, accordingly, on the customer base of the FHLB.                                   The level of government support received by the FHLB ensures its ability to meet its obligations and therefore provide for the ultimate recoverability of the stock at par value.  The level of government support includes access to the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprise Credit Facility as a liquidity backstop, which will allow the FHLB to continue serving its customer base.  The Company believes that the level of government support provides further evidence as to the recoverability of the stock holding at par value.                             d.     The liquidity position of the FHLB.                                   The FHLB maintains contingency liquidity in accordance with Finance Agency and Board of Director policy in addition to access to the U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprise Credit Facility.  Contingency liquidity includes: marketable assets with a maturity of one year or less, self-liquidating assets with a maturity of one year or less, collateral generally accepted in the repurchase market, and lines of credit with financial institutions receiving no less than the second highest credit rating from a nationally recognized rating organization.  The level of liquidity will ensure the FHLB continues to service its customers and serves as the base for the ultimate recoverability of the stock holding at par value.                             e.     Whether a decline is temporary or whether it affects the ultimate recoverability of the FHLB stock based on (a) the materiality of the carrying amount to the member institution and (b) whether an assessment of the institution’s operational needs for the foreseeable future allow management to dispose of the stock.       23     Table of Contents                        The Company does not deem the holding of FHLB stock to be material in terms of financial performance or liquidity position.  The Company does not rely on the payment of dividends from the FHLB as a source of income, but rather the Company considers the stock part of conducting business.  While the FHLB is utilized as a source of funding, the Company has other avenues to obtain funding ranging from customer deposits, other financial institutions, CDARS deposits, brokered money and other wholesale sources.  The Company’s current liquidity plan does not contemplate any cash generated from the sale of its FHLB capital stock.  The ability to reduce FHLB funding reliance through other sources illustrates that the importance of liquidating FHLB stock is not essential to the overall liquidity position of the Company.                                   During the first quarter of 2012 the FHLB redeemed capital stock held by MVB in the amount of $97,500.  They also declared a .10 per share dividend which was paid in February 2012.   Loans   MVB’s lending is primarily focused in Marion, Harrison, Berkeley, Jefferson and Monongalia County, West Virginia with a secondary focus on the adjacent counties in West Virginia. The portfolio consists principally of commercial lending, retail lending, which includes single-family residential mortgages and consumer lending. Loans totaled $373.8 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $294.0 million at December 31, 2010.   During 2011, MVB experienced loan growth of $79.8 million. The most significant portion of the growth came in the residential real estate and commercial and non-residential real estate area. Residential real estate loans grew $42.7 million and commercial and non-residential real estate loans grew approximately $36.7 million.   At December 31, 2011, commercial loans represented the largest portion of the portfolio approximating 61.9% of the total loan portfolio. Commercial loans totaled $231.4 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $194.7 million at December 31, 2010. Management will continue to focus on the enhancement and growth of the commercial loan portfolio while maintaining appropriate underwriting standards and risk/price balance.       24     Table of Contents        Residential real estate loans to MVB’s retail customers (including home equity lines of credit) account for the second largest portion of the loan portfolio, comprising 34.4% of MVB’s total loan portfolio. Residential real estate loans totaled $128.7 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $86.0 million at December 31, 2010. Included in residential real estate loans are home equity credit lines totaling $15.9 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $14.3 million at December 31, 2010. Management believes the home equity loans are competitive products with an acceptable return on investment after risk considerations. Residential real estate lending continues to represent a primary focus of MVB’s lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan and the opportunity to provide service to those in the Marion, Harrison, Berkeley, Jefferson and Monongalia County markets.   Consumer lending continues to be a part of MVB’s core lending. At December 31, 2011, consumer loan balances totaled $13.8 million compared to $13.3 million at December 31, 2010. The majority of MVB’s consumer loans are in the direct lending area. Management is pleased with the performance and quality of the consumer loan portfolio, which can be attributed to the many years of experience of its consumer lenders. This is another important product necessary to serve MVB’s market areas.       25     Table of Contents        The following table provides additional information about MVB’s loans:   Loan maturities at December 31, 2011:   (Dollars in Thousands)               One Year       One Thru       Due After                     or Less       Five Years       Five Years       Total     Commercial and nonresidential real estate       $ 43,840         $ 72,794         $ 114,723         $ 231,357                                                             Residential real estate         9,989           24,397           94,297           128,683                                                             Consumer and other         4,605           7,039           2,138           13,782                                                             Total       $ 58,434         $ 104,230         $ 211,158         $ 373,822     The preceding data has been compiled based upon the earlier of either contractual maturity or next repricing date   Loan Portfolio Analysis:       (Dollars in Thousands)       2011       2010     Year-end balances:                             Commercial, financial and agricultural         231,357           194,700       Real estate         128,683           86,020       Consumer         13,782           13,324                                     Total         373,822           294,044     Loan Concentration   At December 31, 2011, commercial loans comprised the largest component of the loan portfolio. There are very few commercial loans that are not secured by real estate. Such non-real estate secured loans generally are lines of credit secured by accounts receivable. While the loan concentration is in commercial loans, the commercial portfolio is comprised of loans to many different borrowers, in numerous different industries but primarily located in our market areas.   Allowance for Loan Losses   Management continually monitors the risk in the loan portfolio through review of the monthly delinquency reports and the Loan Review Committee. The Loan Review Committee is responsible for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. This analysis involves both experience of the portfolio to date and the makeup of the overall portfolio. Specific loss estimates are derived for individual loans based on specific criteria such as current delinquent status, related deposit account activity, where applicable, local market rumors, which are generally based on some factual information, and changes in the local and national economy. While local market rumors are not measurable or perhaps not readily supportable, historically, this form of information has been a valuable indication of a potential problem.       26     Table of Contents        The result of the evaluation of the adequacy at each period presented herein indicated that the allowance for loan losses was considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio.   At December 31, 2011 and 2010 MVB had impaired loans totaling $2.8 million and $856,000 respectively. Included in these totals were non-accrual loans totaling $2.7 million and $519,000 respectively. A portion of the Allowance for Loan Losses was allocated to cover any loss in these loans.

Net charge-offs represented .35% and .33% in 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to average outstanding loans for the indicated period.               2011       2010     Balance, January 1       $ 2,478         $ 2,241                                     Provision         1,723           1,100                                     Charge-offs         1,189           912       Recoveries         (33 )         (49 )     Less: Net charge-offs         1,156           863                                     Balance, December 31       $ 3,045         $ 2,478     The following table reflects the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31:       (Dollars in Thousands)       2011       2010     Allocation of allowance for loan losses at December 31:                             Commercial       $ 2,164         $ 1,517       Real estate         615           667       Consumer         266           294                                     Total       $ 3,045         $ 2,478                                     Percent of loans to total loans at December 31:                             Commercial         62 %         66 %     Real estate         34           29       Consumer         4           5       Total         100 %         100 %   Non-performing assets consist of loans that are no longer accruing interest, loans that have been renegotiated to below market rates based upon financial difficulties of the borrower, and real estate acquired through foreclosure. When interest accruals are suspended, accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss. When, in management’s judgment, the borrower’s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt, the loan is returned to accrual status.       27     Table of Contents        Non-performing assets and past due loans:       (Dollars in Thousands)       2011       2010                                   Non-accrual loans                             Commercial       $ 2,453         $ 828       Real estate         76           1,243       Consumer         163           158                                     Total non-accrual loans         2,692           2,229       Renegotiated loans         518           —                                     Total non-performing loans         3,210           2,229                                     Other real estate, net         176           402                                     Total non-performing assets       $ 3,386         $ 2,631                                     Accruing loans past due 90 days or more         66           562                                     Non-performing loans as a % of total loans         0.91 %         0.76 %     Allowance for loan losses as a % of non-performing loans         94.86 %         111.17 %   Funding Sources   MVB considers a number of alternatives, including but not limited to deposits, short-term borrowings, and long-term borrowings when evaluating funding sources. Traditional deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for MVB, totaling $390.5 million, or 81.7% of MVB’s funding sources at December 31, 2011. This same information at December 31, 2010 reflected $300.4 million in deposits representing 79.8% of such funding sources. Cash management accounts, which are available to large corporate customers, represented 16.3% and 12.6% of MVB’s funding sources at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh for specific purposes represented the remainder of such funding sources.   Management continues to emphasize the development of additional non-interest-bearing deposits as a core funding source for MVB. At December 31, 2011, non-interest-bearing balances totaled $38.6 million compared to $28.4 million at December 31, 2010 or 9.9% and 9.5% of total deposits respectively.   Interest-bearing deposits totaled $351.9 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $272.0 million at December 31, 2010. On a percentage basis, Certificates of Deposits compose the largest component of MVB’s deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled $391.7 million during 2011 compared to $329.4 million during 2010. Average non-interest bearing liabilities totaled $41.7 million during 2011 compared to $32.9 million during 2010. Management will continue to emphasize deposit gathering in 2012 by offering outstanding customer service and competitively priced products.   Maturities of Certificates of Deposit $100,000 or more:       (Dollars in Thousands)       2011                       Under 3 months       $ 10,891       Over 3-6 months         14,946       Over 6 to 12 months         18,267       Over 12 months         21,212       Total       $ 65,316         28     Table of Contents        There are no other time deposits of $100,000 or more.   Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and repurchase agreements:       (Dollars in Thousands)       2011       2010                                   Ending balance       $ 87,602         $ 76,237       Average balance         72,878           65,807       Highest month-end balance         99,268           80,361       Interest expense         967           987       Weighted average interest rate:                             End of Year         1.08 %         1.34 %     During the Year         1.33 %         1.62 %   Along with traditional deposits, MVB has access to both overnight repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to fund its operations and investments. MVB’s repurchase agreements totaled $77.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $47.6 million in 2010. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings totaled $9.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $28.6 million at year-end 2010.   Capital/Stockholders’ Equity   During the year ended December 31, 2011, stockholders’ equity increased approximately $17.0 million to $47.7 million. This increase consists of MVB’s net income for the year of $2.7 million, along with a capital raise of $6.6 million to accredited investors during January 2011 and the addition of $8.5 million in SBLF capital during the third quarter of 2011. MVB paid dividends of $218,000 in 2011 and $210,000 in 2010.   At December 31, 2011, accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) totaled ($742,000), an increase in the loss of $479,000 from December 31, 2010. This principally represents net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes, and the adjustment to pension liability, net of income taxes, at December 31, 2011. Because the vast majority of all the investment securities in MVB’s portfolio are classified as available-for-sale, both the investment and equity sections of MVB’s balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than those institutions that classify more of their investment portfolio as “held to maturity”. Interest rate fluctuations between year-end 2011 and 2010 resulted in the change in market value of the portfolio.   MVB has also complied with the standards of capital adequacy mandated by the banking industry. Bank regulators have established “risk-based” capital requirements designed to measure capital adequacy. Risk-based capital ratios reflect the relative risks of various assets banks hold in their portfolios. A weight category of either 0% (lowest risk assets), 20%, 50%, or 100% (highest risk assets) is assigned to each asset on the balance sheet. Detailed information concerning MVB’s risk-based capital ratios can be found in Note 14 of the Notes to the Audited Financial Statements. At December 31, 2011, MVB’s risk-based capital ratios were above the minimum standards for a well-capitalized institution. MVB’s risk-based capital ratio of 15.8% at December 31, 2011, is above the well-capitalized standard of 10%. MVB’s Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.9% also exceeded the well-capitalized minimum of 6%. The leverage ratio at December 31, 2011, was 9.6% and was also above the well-capitalized standard of 5%. Management believes MVB’s capital continues to provide a strong base for profitable growth.   Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity   The objective of MVB’s asset/liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income within its policy guidelines. This objective is accomplished through management of MVB’s balance sheet liquidity and interest rate risk exposure based on changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels, and customer preferences.       29     Table of Contents        Interest Rate Risk   The most significant market risk resulting from MVB’s normal course of business, extending loans and accepting deposits, is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes which can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities. MVB’s Asset/ Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for the overall review and management of the Bank’s balance sheets related to the management of interest rate risk. The ALCO strives to keep MVB focused on the future, anticipating and exploring alternatives, rather than simply reacting to change after the fact.   To this end, the ALCO has established an interest risk management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and controlling the level and amount of interest rate risk. The objective of the interest rate risk policy is to encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges of changing markets. The ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy, liquidity, and safety.   The ALCO relies on different methods of assessing interest rate risk including simulating net interest income, monitoring the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity or economic value of equity, and monitoring the difference or gap between maturing or rate-sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods. The ALCO places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of interest rate risk due to its dynamic measure. By employing a simulation process that measures the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures, and by establishing limits on changes in net income and net market value, the ALCO is better able to evaluate the possible risks associated with alternative strategies.   The simulation process starts with a base case simulation which represents projections of current balance sheet growth trends. Base case simulation results are prepared under a flat interest rate forecast and what is perceived to be the most likely alternative interest rate forecast. Comparisons showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet strategy. If necessary, additional balance sheet strategies are developed and simulations prepared. The results from model simulations are reviewed for indications of whether current interest rate risk strategies are accomplishing their goal and, if not, what alternative strategies should be considered. The policy calls for periodic review by the ALCO of assumptions used in the modeling.   The ALCO believes that it is beneficial to monitor interest rate risk for both the short-and long-term. Therefore, to effectively evaluate results from model simulations, limits on changes in net interest income and the value of the balance sheet have been established. The ALCO has determined that the earnings at risk of the Bank shall not change more than 10 % from the base case for a 1% shift in interest rates, nor more than 15 % from the base case for a 2% shift in interest rates. MVB is in compliance with this policy as of December 31, 2011.       30     Table of Contents        The following table is provided to show the earnings at risk of MVB as of December 31, 2011.   (Dollars in Thousands)       Immediate       Estimated Increase     Interest Rate Change       (Decrease) in Net     (one year time frame)         Interest Income     (in Basis Points)       December 31, 2011                Amount         Percent     +200       $ 16,004           -14.3 %     +100         17,029           -8.8. %           Base rate         18,679                   -100         19,300           3.3 %     -200       $ 19,114           2.3 %   Liquidity   Maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity is a primary objective of the ALCO. Liquidity, as defined by the ALCO, is the ability to meet anticipated operating cash needs, loan demand, and deposit withdrawals, without incurring a sustained negative impact on net interest income. It is MVB’s policy to manage liquidity so that there is no need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions.   The main source of liquidity for MVB comes through deposit growth. Liquidity is also provided from cash generated from investment maturities, principal payments from loans, and income from loans and investment securities. During the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by financing activities totaled $116.1 million, while outflows from investing activity totaled $109.7 million. When appropriate, MVB has the ability to take advantage of external sources of funds such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), national market certificate of deposit issuance programs, the Federal Reserve discount window, brokered deposits and CDARS. These external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable MVB to match funding with contractual maturity dates of assets. Securities in the investment portfolio are primarily classified as available-for-sale and can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity.   Off-Balance Sheet Commitments   MVB has entered into certain agreements that represent off-balance sheet arrangements that could have a significant impact on MVB’s financial statements and could have a significant impact in future periods. Specifically, MVB has entered into agreements to extend credit or provide conditional payments pursuant to standby and commercial letters of credit. Further discussion of these agreements, including the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2011, is included in Note 7 to the financial statements.   Commitments to extend credit, including loan commitments, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon.       31     Table of Contents        Fourth Quarter   MVB’s fourth quarter net income was $727,000 in 2011 compared to $682,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010. This equated to basic earnings per share, on a quarterly basis, of $.33 in 2011 and $.43 in 2010. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 and 2010 were $.33 and $.42, respectively. Net interest income increased during the fourth quarter and was $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $3.0 million in 2010. Non-interest income was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to $729,000 in 2010. Non-interest expense increased to $3.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 from $2.6 million in 2010. Loan loss provision was $502,000 for the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $162,000 over the fourth quarter of 2010.   Future Outlook   The Bank’s net income in 2011 was better than in any prior year, despite the challenges of a continued poor economic climate and the addition of a new office in Morgantown, WV. MVB believes it is well positioned in some of the finest markets in the state of West Virginia. We believe with continued customer acceptance in our markets and our commitment to customer service, we will continue to capture market share with our emphasis on the highest quality products and technology.   Future plans for the Bank involve the Bank taking advantage of both technology and personal customer contact. The Bank continues to expand delivery channels to better serve both retail and business banking customers. In addition to “top of the line” technology, the Bank is committed to providing individual and personal banking services. MVB will continue to search for quality banking locations as well as exploring alternative delivery systems.   ITEM 7A.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. This review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 83 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables 1 through 22 included with this discussion and analysis.   Overview - 2011 Compared to 2010   Net income for 2011 increased by 27.3% over 2010. Earnings for 2011 were impacted by a bargain purchase gain and accelerated accretion on our preferred stock discount (see discussion below).       Financial Highlights                             ($ in thousands except per share data)       2011       2010       Change                                   Earnings                                         Net interest income       $ 132,203           127,354           3.8 %     Provision for loan losses – non-covered         28,525           33,646           -15.2 %     Provision for loan losses - covered         12,776           20,916           -38.9 %     Noninterest income         26,216           29,106           -9.9 %     Noninterest expenses         96,106           86,956           10.5 %     Income before income taxes         21,012           14,942           40.6 %     Income tax expense         7,370           4,960           48.6 %     Net income         13,642           9,982           36.7 %     Preferred stock dividends         (3,234 )         (3,250 )                 Accretion of preferred stock discount         (2,932 )         (857 )                 Net income available to common shareholders       $ 7,476           5,875           27.3 %                                               Net income per common share                                         Basic       $ 0.44           0.35           25.7 %     Diluted         0.44           0.35           25.7 %                                               At Year End                                         Assets       $ 3,290,474           3,278,932           0.4 %     Loans         2,430,386           2,454,132           -1.0 %     Deposits         2,755,037           2,652,513           3.9 %                                               Ratios                                         Return on average assets         0.23 %         0.18 %                 Return on average common equity         2.59 %         2.05 %                 Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)         4.72 %         4.39 %               The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for 2011 compared to 2010:   For the year ended December 31, 2011, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million compared to $5.9 million reported for 2010. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.44 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0.35 for 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, we realized a $10.2 million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank, which is recorded in noninterest income. The after-tax impact of this gain on net income was $6.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share.   In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded $2.3 million of accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on the preferred stock that was redeemed during the quarter. This stock was originally issued to the U.S. Treasury in January 2009 as part of the program known as TARP. When this preferred stock was redeemed, the remaining discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the stock, which had been on a five year accretion schedule, was immediately accreted as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Total discount accretion of the preferred stock for 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share.     28     Table of Contents         In both 2011 and 2010, we experienced significant write-downs and losses associated with loans and foreclosed properties that were assumed in two failed bank acquisitions. The amounts of the write-downs and losses were less in 2011 than in 2010, but continued to significantly impact our earnings.   We note that our results of operation are significantly affected by the on-going accounting for the two FDIC-assisted failed bank acquisitions that we have completed. In the discussion below, the term “covered” is used to describe assets included as part of FDIC loss share agreements, which generally result in the FDIC reimbursing the Company for 80% of losses incurred.   For covered loans that deteriorate in terms of repayment expectations, we record immediate allowances through the provision of loan losses. For covered loans that experience favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date, including loans that payoff, we record positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan – also referred to as loan discount accretion. For foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values, we record gains/losses within noninterest income.   The adjustments discussed above are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations. The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income.   The adjustments noted above can result in volatility within individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset, pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans, discount accretion, and losses from covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset.   Total assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $3.3 billion, a 0.4% increase from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2011 amounted to $2.4 billion, a 1.0% decrease from a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011, a 3.9% increase from a year earlier.   Since the onset of the recession, we have generally experienced declines in loans and deposits. Normal loan paydowns, loan charge-offs, and loan foreclosures have exceeded new loan growth, which has provided the liquidity to lessen our reliance on high cost deposits. However, for the last half of 2011, we experienced modest growth in our non-covered loan portfolio, which increased $28 million from June 30, 2011 through year end. We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve our asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our preferred stock, as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Brokered deposits remained at a low level at December 31, 2011, comprising just 5.7% of total deposits, with internet deposits comprising an additional 1.1%.   Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $132.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 3.8%, from 2010. The higher net interest income was primarily caused by an increase in 2011 in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions. Loan discount accretion amounted to $11.6 million for 2011 compared to $7.6 million in 2010, an increase of $4 million. As previously discussed, the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only 20% of the gross amount of the change. See “Net Interest Income” below for additional information.     29     Table of Contents         Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets) for 2011 was 4.72% compared to 4.39% for 2010. The higher margin was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in loan discount accretion, as well as a decline in funding costs.   Our provisions for loan losses remain elevated compared to historical levels, primarily due to continued high unemployment rates and ongoing declines in property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. Our provision for loan losses for non-covered loans amounted to $28.5 million for 2011 compared to $33.6 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans.   We recorded $12.8 million in provision for loan losses on covered loans during 2011 compared to $20.9 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was due to declines in covered nonperforming loans resulting from the resolution of a significant amount of these loans through a combination of charge-offs and foreclosures.   Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010.   Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $141 million compared to $168 million at December 31, 2010.   Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $26.2 million compared to $29.1 million for 2010. The decline in noninterest income in 2011 is primarily due to lower amounts of indemnification asset income recorded. As previously discussed, when we anticipate receiving additional amounts from the FDIC because of new losses identified in our covered loan and foreclosed property portfolios, we record indemnification asset income for 80% of the expected loss. In 2011, fewer new losses were identified compared to 2010, and thus less indemnification asset income was recorded.   Noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $96.1 million, a 10.5% increase from the $87.0 million recorded in 2010. The majority of the increase relates to personnel expense, which increased partially due to employees joining the Company in the 2011 Bank of Asheville acquisition. We also experienced higher employee medical expense due to higher claims in 2011 compared to 2010. We have also progressively built our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities and the overall growth of the Company, and to prepare for future growth, which has generally resulted in higher expenses across all categories.   Our effective tax rates were 35.1% and 33.2% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.     30     Table of Contents         Overview – 2010 Compared to 2009   Net income was significantly lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to a gain that resulted from the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June 2009. Most items of income and expense were higher in 2010 than in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, which impacted the Company for twelve months in 2010 compared to six months in 2009 beginning with the June acquisition date. In 2010, our provision for loan losses increased significantly due to deterioration of asset quality, which we believe was primarily caused by the recessionary economic environment, including its unfavorable effect on real estate values.       Financial Highlights                             ($ in thousands except per share data)       2010       2009       Change                                   Earnings                             Net interest income       $ 127,354           107,096           18.9 %     Provision for loan losses – non-covered         33,646           20,186           66.7 %     Provision for loan losses - covered         20,916           —            n/m       Noninterest income         29,106           89,518           -67.5 %     Noninterest expenses         86,956           78,551           10.7 %     Income before income taxes         14,942           97,877           -84.7 %     Income tax expense         4,960           37,618           -86.8 %     Net income         9,982           60,259           -83.4 %     Preferred stock dividends         (3,250 )         (3,169 )                 Accretion of preferred stock discount         (857 )         (803 )                 Net income available to common shareholders       $ 5,875           56,287           -89.6 %                                               Net income per common share                                         Basic       $ 0.35           3.38           -89.6 %     Diluted         0.35           3.37           -89.6 %                                               At Year End                                         Assets       $ 3,278,932           3,545,356           -7.5 %     Loans         2,454,132           2,652,865           -7.5 %     Deposits         2,652,513           2,933,108           -9.6 %                                               Ratios                                         Return on average assets         0.18 %         1.82 %                 Return on average common equity         2.05 %         22.55 %                 Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent)         4.39 %         3.81 %               The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for 2010 compared to 2009:   For the year ended December 31, 2010, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.9 million compared to $56.3 million reported for 2009. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3.37 for 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, we realized a $67.9 million gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank. The after-tax impact of this gain was $41.1 million, or $2.46 per diluted common share.   Earnings reported for 2010 were impacted by write-downs of foreclosed properties that were assumed in our 2009 failed bank acquisition and also by higher provisions for loan losses related both to loans acquired in the failed bank acquisition and to our legacy loans (loans not obtained in the failed bank acquisition).   Total assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $3.3 billion, a 7.5% decrease from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2010 amounted to $2.5 billion, a 7.5% decrease from a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a 9.6% decrease from a year earlier. The contraction of our balance sheet was primarily a result of weak loan demand during 2010, which allowed us to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding.     31     Table of Contents         We began experiencing a general decline in loans beginning in 2009 as the full effect of the recession took hold. Loans declined approximately $199 million, or 7.5%, in 2010.   Our deposits declined $281 million, or 9.6%, in 2010. The decrease was primarily associated with time deposits, which are generally our highest cost source of funds. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program.   Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $127.4 million, an 18.9% increase from 2009. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to 1) a higher net interest margin, and 2) the higher average balances of loans and deposits realized from the June 2009 Cooperative Bank acquisition.   Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets) for 2010 was 4.39% compared to 3.81% for 2009. During 2010, there were no changes in the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and we were able to continue to lower rates on our deposits, especially on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher interest rates. Also positively impacting net interest income were purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to our failed bank acquisition in 2009, including adjustments to loan interest income previously discussed. See “Net Interest Income” below for additional discussion.   The economic environment, including its unfavorable effect on real estate values, resulted in an increase in our loan losses and nonperforming assets, which led to significantly higher provisions for loan losses in 2010. Our provision for loan losses amounted to $54.6 million for 2010 compared to $20.2 million recorded in 2009. In 2010, our provision for loan losses was comprised of $33.6 million in provisions related to non-covered loans and $20.9 million related to covered loans, whereas in prior years the provision only related to non-covered loans.   We recorded $33.6 million and $20.2 million in provision for loan losses during 2010 and 2009, respectively, for non-covered loans. The higher provisions for loan losses were necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans.   We recorded $20.9 million in provision for loan losses during 2010 related to covered loans that experienced credit quality deterioration. The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent loans for which we received updated appraisals during 2010 that reflected lower valuations.   Net loan charge-offs for 2010 were $42.5 million compared to $12.1 million in 2009. Net charge-offs increased primarily as a result of declines in real estate values. In 2010, net charge-offs were also impacted by charge-offs of covered loans and the recording of partial charge-offs of non-covered loans, neither of which occurred during 2009. We recorded approximately $9.8 million in charge-offs of covered loans in 2010 compared to none in 2009. Also, we recorded partial charge-offs of non-covered loans amounting to $8.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2010. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses, but did not record the charge-offs until the loans were foreclosed upon.   Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $117 million compared to $92 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.16% compared to 3.10% at December 31, 2009.     32     Table of Contents         Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $168 million compared to $165 million at December 31, 2009.   Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $29.1 million compared to $89.5 million for 2009. In 2009, we recorded a $67.9 million bargain purchase gain in connection with the acquisition of a failed bank. In 2010, we recorded $35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed property, the majority of which related to the market deterioration of foreclosed properties associated with the failed bank acquisition. We recorded $41.8 million in indemnification asset income related to higher than anticipated claims that we will be able to make with the FDIC under the loss share agreements, primarily relating to loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs.   Noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $87.0 million, a 10.7% increase from the $78.6 million recorded in 2009. Incremental operating expenses associated with the failed bank acquisition were the primary reason for the increases in 2010. Included in other operating expenses for 2010 were approximately $2.6 million in costs (net of FDIC reimbursements) associated with collection activities on loans and foreclosed properties covered by FDIC loss share agreements, compared to $0.8 million in 2009.   Our effective tax rates were 33.2% and 38.4% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to increased investment holdings of tax-exempt municipal securities.   Outlook for 2012   We expect the banking industry, particularly in our region, to continue to face significant challenges in 2012. While there has been some favorable national economic data reported in recent months, we have seen little, if any, improvement in the unfavorable economic statistics affecting our region. These include unemployment rates, housing starts, home prices, and the number of personal and business bankruptcies. We believe that the Carolinas and Virginia may have been relatively late to experience the downturn in the national economy and that this region is lagging the rest of the country in recovery. Thus, we believe that our loan losses will continue to remain at elevated levels compared to historical norms. We also expect that the weak economy will continue to result in low loan demand.   We believe that regulatory reform will negatively impact our earnings. The regulatory climate is not favorable for banks. We expect additional overhead costs will be necessary to comply with all of the new regulations expected to arise directly or indirectly from the Dodd-Frank Act.   In 2009 and 2011 we acquired failed banks with approximately $959 and $193 million in assets, respectively. These acquisitions resulted in significant volatility to our earnings in 2009, 2010, and 2011, primarily as a result of the bargain purchase gains recorded on the acquisition dates that increased earnings and write-downs of foreclosed properties in 2010 and 2011 that negatively impacted earnings. While we expect the acquisitions to eventually be accretive to earnings on a consistent basis, we believe that they may continue to add volatility to our reported earnings in 2012. The volatility may be positive to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans improves, or negative to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans deteriorates or if the properties we have foreclosed on continue to decline in value.     33     Table of Contents         Critical Accounting Policies   The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements.   Allowance for Loan Losses   Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio.   Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components. The first component involves the estimation of losses on non-single family home loans or relationships greater than $500,000 that are defined as “impaired loans.” A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The estimated valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan’s effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral.   The second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and all loans not considered to be impaired loans. Impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and loans that we have classified as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type, and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type, based on the historical losses, current economic conditions, and operational conditions specific to each loan type. Loans that we have risk graded as having more than “standard” risk but not considered to be impaired are segregated between those relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000 and those that are less than that amount. For those loan relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000, we review the attributes of each individual loan and assign any necessary loss reserve based on various factors including payment history, borrower strength, collateral value, and guarantor strength. For loan relationships less than $500,000 with more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired, loss percentages are based on a multiple of the estimated loss rate for loans of a similar loan type with normal risk. The multiples assigned vary by type of loan, depending on risk, and we have consulted with an external credit review firm in assigning those multiples.   The reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans. This becomes our “allocated allowance.” In addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model, we also evaluate other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, net loan growth information, nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data. Based on this additional analysis, we may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses. This additional amount, if any, is our “unallocated allowance.” The sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded.     34     Table of Contents         Loans covered under loss share agreements are recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become a part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan. Proportional adjustments are also recorded to the FDIC indemnification asset.   Although we use the best information available to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations.   For further discussion, see “Nonperforming Assets” and “Summary of Loan Loss Experience” below.   Intangible Assets   Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements.   When we complete an acquisition transaction, the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized. Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill.   The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we acquire an insurance agency, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis.   Subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value, including goodwill (our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit). If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions.     35     Table of Contents         At our last goodwill impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of our community banking operation was approximately $18.50 per common share, or 8% higher, than the $17.08 stated book value of our common stock at the date of valuation. To assist us in computing the fair value of our community banking operation, we engaged a consulting firm who used various valuation techniques as part of their analysis, which resulted in the conclusion of the $18.50 value.   We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above.   Fair Value and Discount Accretion of Loans Acquired in FDIC-Assisted Transactions   We consider the determination of the initial fair value of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions, the initial fair value of the related FDIC indemnification asset, and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. We determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates, the FDIC indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss-sharing support from the FDIC.   Because of the inherent credit losses associated with the acquired loans in a failed bank acquisition, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the “discount” on the acquired loans. We have applied the cost recovery method of accounting to all purchased impaired loans due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected cash flows. This will result in the recognition of interest income on these impaired loans only when the cash payments received from the borrower exceed the recorded net book value of the related loans.   For nonimpaired purchased loans, we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs.   Merger and Acquisition Activity   In both 2009 and 2011 we completed a FDIC-assisted transaction of a failed bank. There were no significant acquisitions in 2010. The results of each acquired company/branch are included in our financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions.   In October 2011, we announced that we had entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank, headquartered in Whiteville, North Carolina. The agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches from Waccamaw Bank, which includes assuming all deposits, selected performing loans, and all premises and equipment. Deposits total approximately $180 million and loans total approximately $98 million. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.     36     Table of Contents         FDIC Indemnification Asset   As previously discussed, on June 19, 2009 and January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, respectively, in FDIC-assisted transactions. For each transaction, the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two loss share agreements with the FDIC, which afford First Bank significant loss protection. Under the Cooperative Bank loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million, and 95% of losses in excess of that amount. Under The Bank of Asheville loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of all covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses. For both transactions, the loss share reimbursements are applicable for ten years for single family home loans and five years for all other loans.   We have recorded a FDIC indemnification asset related to the two transactions to account for payments that we expect to receive from the FDIC related to the loss share agreements. The carrying value of this receivable at each period end is the sum of: 1) actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been received and 2) our estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied by the FDIC reimbursement percentage.   At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the FDIC indemnification asset was comprised of the following components:       ($ in thousands)       2011       2010     Receivable related to claims submitted, not yet received       $ 13,377           30,201       Receivable related to estimated future claims on loans         90,275           86,966       Receivable related to estimated future claims on other real estate owned         18,025           6,552       FDIC indemnification asset       $ 121,677           123,719     As of each acquisition date, based on the losses inherent in the covered assets and what we estimated we would receive as payments from the FDIC, we recorded a “FDIC Indemnification Asset.” Since that time, we have recorded adjustments to the indemnification asset as discussed below.   The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted upwards in the following circumstances:   1) Deterioration of credit quality of covered loans – As of the acquisition dates, we recorded the loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville on our books at a fair value that was $227.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively, less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers, which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of these portfolios change and better information is obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected. For loans with worse repayment expectations, we record provisions for loan losses with corresponding increases to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded provisions for loan losses on covered loans amounting to $12.8 million and $20.9 million, respectively, which resulted in an adjustment to the FDIC indemnification asset of $10.2 million and $16.7 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009.   2) Write-downs and losses on foreclosed properties – When we foreclose on delinquent borrowers, we initially record the foreclosed property at the lower of book or fair value (based on current appraisals), with any deficiency recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent to the foreclosure, we periodically order updated appraisals and if the appraisal indicates a fair value lower than our carrying value, we must write the property down. Also, periodically we sell foreclosed properties that result in losses. Each of these situations results in the Company recording losses on other real estate owned with a corresponding increase to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded losses and write downs on covered foreclosed properties amounting to $24.5 million and $34.5 million, respectively, which resulted in upward adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset of $19.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009.     37     Table of Contents         3) Expenses incurred related to collection activities on covered assets – As a result of our collection efforts, we incur expenses such as legal fees, property taxes and appraisal costs. Many of these expenses are reimbursable by the FDIC. These expenses are recorded as “other” noninterest expenses and a corresponding increase is made to increase the FDIC indemnification asset by reducing the gross collection expenses by the amount expected to be reimbursed by the FDIC for eligible expenses. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred $8.5 million, $5.5 million, and $2.1 million in gross collection expenses related to covered assets, respectively, and reduced that amount by $5.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.3 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively.   The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted downwards in the following circumstances:   1) Receipt of cash from the FDIC related to claims submitted – On at least a quarterly basis, we submit eligible loss share claims to the FDIC. After reviewing and approving the claims, the FDIC wires us cash, which reduces the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received $69.3 million, $46.7 million and $40.5 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively.   2) Accretion of discount on acquired loans – As noted above, we recorded the acquired loans of the two transactions on our books at a fair value that was $280 million (in total) less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers (the “discount”), which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of this portfolio changes and better information is obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected (discussed above). For loans with improved repayment expectations, we are systematically reducing the discount over the life of the loan as it repays. For some loans, we have received complete payoffs at the contractual balance and the discount must be reduced to zero. When we reduce/accrete the discount, we do so by recognizing interest income in that same amount. When the expected losses on loans with improved repayment expectations becomes less than the original estimate, our expected reimbursement from the FDIC declines as well. Accordingly, we reduce the FDIC indemnification asset by the corresponding reimbursement percentage. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded discount accretion of $11.6 million, $7.6 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, which resulted in a reduction of FDIC indemnification asset of $9.3 million, $6.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.   In summary, circumstances that result in adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations. The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income.   The adjustments can result in volatility within individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset, pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses, interest income, and losses from foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset.     38     Table of Contents         The following presents a rollforward of the FDIC indemnification asset since the date of the Cooperative Bank acquisition on June 19, 2009.       ($ in thousands)                 Balance at June 19, 2009       $ 185,112       Decrease related to favorable change in loss estimates         (1,516 )     Increase related to reimbursable expenses         1,300       Cash received         (40,500 )     Accretion of loan discount         (1,175 )     Balance at December 31, 2009         143,221       Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates         30,419       Increase related to reimbursable expenses         2,900       Cash received         (46,721 )     Accretion of loan discount         (6,100 )     Balance at December 31, 2010         123,719       Increase related to acquisition of The Bank of Asheville         42,218       Increase related to unfavorable change in loss estimates         29,814       Increase related to reimbursable expenses         5,725       Cash received         (69,339 )     Accretion of loan discount         (9,278 )     Other         (1,182 )     Balance at December 31, 2011       $ 121,677     ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Net interest income, the “spread” between earnings on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, constitutes the largest source of our earnings. Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs, as well as the effects of income taxes.   Net Interest Income   Net interest income on a reported basis amounted to $132.2 million in 2011, $127.4 million in 2010, and $107.1 million in 2009. For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt securities to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $133.8 million in 2011, $128.7 million in 2010, and $107.9 million in 2009. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income.               Year ended December 31,     ($ in thousands)       2011       2010       2009     Net interest income, as reported       $ 132,203           127,354           107,096       Tax-equivalent adjustment         1,556           1,316           818       Net interest income, tax-equivalent       $ 133,759           128,670           107,914     Table 2 analyzes net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.0% in 2011 and 19.2% in 2010. There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances, and 2) our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets).     39     Table of Contents         For 2011, the increase in net interest income over the comparable period in 2010 was due to a higher net interest margin, which was partially offset by a lower level of earning assets due to a contraction of our balance sheet during 2011. In 2010, higher average loan and deposit balances increased net interest income. Also, the positive effects of the increased balances in 2010 were enhanced by a higher net interest margin.   Although our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in early 2011 resulted in the addition of $102 million in loans, our average loan balances declined by $92 million during the year - from $2.55 billion in 2010 to $2.46 billion in 2011. We believe the decline in loans is primarily a direct and indirect result of the weak economy in our market area. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million that reduced our loan balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions. Also, loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations. With the decline in loans, we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding, including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits, which resulted in lower deposit balances (and, as discussed below, a lower average cost of funds).   Although loans and deposits outstanding decreased during calendar year 2010, the average balances of loans and deposits were both higher in 2010 than they were in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative Bank acquisition that occurred in mid-2009. The loans and deposits acquired in this acquisition impacted loan and deposit balances outstanding for all twelve months of 2010 and for the six month period subsequent to the June 2009 acquisition.   As illustrated in Table 3, the lower average loan and deposit balances negatively impacted net interest income in 2011, while higher balances positively impacted net interest income in 2010. In 2011, declines in interest-earning assets, primarily loans, resulted in a decrease in interest income of $4.4 million, while lower amounts of interest-bearing liabilities resulted in only $0.4 million of lower interest expense. As a result, the net impact of lower loans and deposits was a decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income of $4.0 million in 2011. In 2010, growth in interest-earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of $6.1 million, while higher amounts of interest-bearing liabilities only resulted in $0.5 million in increased interest expense. As a result, the higher average balances of loans and deposits resulted in an increase in tax-equivalent net interest income of $5.6 million in 2010.   Table 3 also illustrates the impact that changes in the interest rates that we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2010 and 2011. In both years, lower interest rates on deposits was the primary factor affecting net interest income. Although the prime rate of interest has not changed since 2008, interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds and other interest-sensitive financial instruments have steadily declined since then, resulting in a generally lower interest rate environment. In both years, the progressively lower interest rate environment gave us the opportunity to reduce rates on matured time deposits, and we were also able to gradually reduce interest rates on demand deposits. In 2010, the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by $17.5 million and in 2011 the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by $7.9 million. The lower interest rate environment had much less impact on our interest income, with the impact of changes in interest rates lowering interest income by $2.3 million in 2010 and increasing it by $1.2 million in 2011. The lesser impact was due to continued use of interest rate floors on loans, as well as the effect of higher levels of loan discount accretion in both 2010 and 2011 (discussed below). Overall, changes in interest rates increased net interest income by $15.2 million in 2010 and $9.1 million in 2011.   We measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled “net interest margin” which is defined as tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Our net interest margin increased 33 basis points in 2011 to 4.72% from 4.39% in 2010. Our net interest margin was 3.81% in 2009.     40     Table of Contents         The primary reason for the increases in our net interest margin has been that the yields on interest-earning assets have remained fairly stable over the past three years, ranging from 5.48% to 5.55%, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities has steadily declined from 1.96% in 2009 to 1.20% in 2010 to 0.90% in 2011. As noted above, our interest-earning asset yields have remained stable because of the continued use of interest rate floors on loans, as well as higher levels of loan discount accretion. Also as noted above, we have been able to lower rates on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher rates throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. And to a lesser degree, we have been able to progressively lower interest rates on various types of savings, NOW and money market accounts. We have also experienced declines in our levels of higher cost deposit balances, including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits.   During each of the past three years, our net interest margin also benefitted from the net accretion of purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June 2009 and, to a lesser degree, the acquisition of Great Pee Dee Bancorp in April 2008 and The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $11.6 million, $10.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, in net accretion of purchase accounting premiums/discounts that increased net interest income. The following table provides detail of the purchase accounting adjustments that impacted net interest income:        ($ in thousands)       Year Ended December 31, 2011       Year Ended December 31, 2010       Year Ended December 31, 2009                                   Interest income – reduced by premium amortization on loans       $ (453 )         (196 )         (196 )     Interest income – increased by accretion of loan discount         11,598           7,607           1,469       Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of deposits         337           2,211           3,911       Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of borrowings         146           341           464       Impact on net interest income       $ 11,628           9,963           5,648     The following table presents the purchase accounting entries that we expect to record in 2012.       ($ in thousands)       Expected - 2012                   Interest income – reduced by premium amortization on loans       $ (465 )     Interest income – increased by accretion of loan discount         See note below       Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of deposits         85       Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of borrowings         30       Impact on net interest income         See note below     Note - We cannot determine the amount of interest income, if any, to be recognized from the accretion of the loan discount on Cooperative loans or The Bank of Asheville loans because it is reliant on our ongoing assessment during the year of the repayment period of the loans, which is impacted by any changes in expected credit losses related to the loans.   See additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled “Interest Rate Risk.”   Provision for Loan Losses   The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth, an evaluation of the portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors.   Our provisions for loan losses and nonperforming assets remain at what we believe to be elevated levels, primarily due to high unemployment rates and declining property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. For 2011, 2010, and 2009 our total provisions for loan losses were $41.3 million, $54.6 million, and $20.2 million, respectively. The total provision for loan losses is comprised of provision for loan losses for non-covered loans and provision for loan losses for covered loans, as discussed in the following paragraphs.     41     Table of Contents         We recorded $28.5 million, $33.6 million, and $20.2 million in provisions for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the years-ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The lower provision for loan losses for non-covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans. The higher provision for non-covered loans in 2010 was necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans.   In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $12.8 million and $20.9 million in provisions for loan losses for covered loans, respectively, that experienced credit quality deterioration. The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals in 2011 and 2010 that reflected lower valuations. The lower provision for loan losses for covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to lower levels of nonperforming covered loans. Because of the FDIC loss-share agreements in place for these loans, the FDIC indemnification asset was adjusted upwards by recording noninterest income of $10.2 million and $16.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, or 80% of the amount of the provisions (see discussion above).   Total net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, were $49.3 million, $42.5 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. As discussed further below, the higher net charge-offs in 2010 and 2011 compared to 2009 were primarily a result of worsening economic conditions, especially related to real estate, that resulted in higher levels of borrowers not repaying their loans.   Net-charge offs for non-covered loans were $31.2 million, $32.7 million and $12.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Net charge-offs of non-covered loans were impacted by $9.0 million and $8.6 million in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Prior to 2010 we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses, but did not record charge-offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon.   Net charge-offs for covered loans were $18.1 million, $9.8 million, and $0 in for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The charge-offs of covered loans were primarily a result of declining collateral values on collateral dependent nonaccrual loans.   In 2011 and 2010, our provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs were concentrated in loans classified as “real estate – construction, land development & other land loans.” This category of loans is primarily comprised of land acquisition and development loans and other types of lot loans. These types of loans have been particularly hard hit by the decline in real estate development and property values. As can be seen in Table 10, although we have reduced our exposure to this category of loans, we continue to have exposure to this sector and future significant losses could result.   Non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million and $92 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% and 3.10% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also see “Nonperforming Assets” below for additional discussion.   See the section entitled “Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience” below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses.     42     Table of Contents         Noninterest Income   Our noninterest income amounted to $26.2 million in 2011, $29.1 million in 2010, and $89.5 million in 2009.   As shown in Table 4, core noninterest income excludes gains from acquisitions, foreclosed property write-downs and losses, indemnification asset income, securities gains or losses, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. Core noninterest income amounted to $23.2 million in 2011, a 4.7% increase from $22.1 million in 2010. The 2010 core noninterest income of $22.1 million was 1.2% higher than the $21.9 million recorded in 2009.   See Table 4 and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income.   Service charges on deposit accounts in 2011 amounted to $12.0 million, a 2.9% decrease compared to $12.3 million recorded in 2010. The $12.3 million recorded in 2010 was 5.9% less than the 2009 amount of $13.1 million. Legislation that became effective on July 1, 2010 reduced our fees earned on overdrafts in 2010 and 2011, which was the primary reason for the declines in this component of noninterest income. Specifically, the legislation now prohibits us from charging an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to our payment of overdrafts for these transactions. Additional regulations on overdraft fees became effective July 1, 2011 that further reduced our overdraft fees, although to a lesser extent than the 2010 changes. In April 2011, we implemented new fees on deposit accounts, such as fees for customers that elect to receive paper statements, that have helped to replace a large portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the overdraft legislation.   Other service charges, commissions and fees amounted to $8.1 million in 2011, a 24.0% increase from the $6.5 million earned in 2010. The 2010 amount of $6.5 million was a 13.6% increase from the $5.7 million earned in 2009. This category of noninterest income includes items such as electronic payment processing revenue (which includes fees related to credit card transactions by merchants and customers and fees earned from debit card transactions), ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The growth in this category for both years was primarily attributable to increased debit card usage by our customers, as we earn a small fee each time our customers make a debit card transaction. Also, part of the increase in this category is due to the overall growth in our total customer base, including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions.   Fees from presold mortgages amounted to $1.6 million in 2011, $1.8 million in 2010, and $1.5 million in 2009. We continue to experience higher mortgage refinance activity due to lower interest rates.   Commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $1.5 million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009. This line item includes commissions we receive from three sources - 1) sales of credit life insurance associated with new loans, 2) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long-term care insurance products, and 3) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item:     43     Table of Contents             ($ in thousands)       2011       2010       2009     Commissions earned from:                             Sales of credit life insurance       $ 70           107           281       Sales of investments, annuities, and long term care insurance         760           531           503       Sales of property and casualty insurance         682           838           740       Total       $ 1,512           1,476           1,524     Noninterest income not considered to be “core” resulted in a net contribution to total noninterest income of $3.0 million in 2011, $7.0 million in 2010, and $67.6 million in 2009. The components of non-core noninterest income are shown in Table 4 and the significant components thereof are discussed below.   In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $27.8 million and $35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed properties, respectively, of which $24.5 million and $34.5 million related to write-downs on covered properties, respectively. Consistent with the other failed bank accounting adjustments discussed earlier, the bottom line impact to pretax income of these write-downs on covered properties was 20% of the gross write-downs.   Indemnification asset income for 2011 and 2010 amounted to $20.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively (with no corresponding amount in 2009). This income primarily relates to upward adjustments to the amount expected to be received from the FDIC under loss share agreements as a result of higher than anticipated loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs, as follows:       ($ in millions)       2011       2010     Higher expected FDIC claims for covered loans experiencing a deterioration in quality       $ 12.7         $ 20.9       Lower expected FDIC claims for covered loans related to loan discount accretion and principal paydowns/payoffs         (11.6 )         (3.2 )     Foreclosed property losses and write-downs - covered         24.5           34.5       Total adjustment to expected FDIC loss-share claims         25.6           52.2       Expected reimbursement rate         80 %         80 %     Indemnification asset income       $ 20.5         $ 41.8     In 2011 and 2009, as previously discussed, we realized gains from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of failed banks amounting to $10.2 million and $67.9 million, respectively, which were the amounts by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed in each transaction.   The line item “Other gains (losses)” was positively impacted in 2010 by the sale of our merchant credit card processing portfolio, which resulted in a gain of $850,000.   Noninterest Expenses   Noninterest expenses for 2011 were $96.1 million, compared to $87.0 million in 2010 and $78.6 million in 2009. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years.   As reflected in the amounts noted above, noninterest expenses increased 10.5% in 2011 and 10.7% in 2010. The increases in noninterest expenses over the past three years have occurred in almost every line item of expense and have been primarily a result of our significant growth. Due to acquisition and internal growth, over the past three years our number of bank branches has increased from 74 to 97, and the number of full time equivalent employees has increased from 650 at December 31, 2008 to 830 at December 31, 2011. Additionally, from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2011, the amount of loans outstanding increased 9.9% and deposits increased 32.8%.     44     Table of Contents         Total personnel expense increased by approximately $6.1 million, or 13.6%, in 2011. Salaries expense comprised $4.7 million of this increase, which was primarily a result of an initiative to progressively build our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities, and overall growth of the Company, as well as to prepare for future growth. Another factor in the increase in salaries expense in 2011 was the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011, which added approximately 35 employees. Higher employee health insurance costs also played a role in the increase in personnel expense in 2011. Employee health insurance expense amounted to $4.4 million in 2011, an increase of $1.3 million over the $3.1 million incurred in 2010. We self-insure our employees’ health care expense; therefore, incurred health care costs directly impact the expense we record.   In 2010, salaries expense increased $4.3 million, primarily due to a full year of salaries related to employees assumed in the June 2009 Cooperative acquisition. The increase in salary expense was partially offset by lower health care expenses of $0.4 million and lower pension expense in 2010 of $0.6 million. Pension expense decreased during 2010 primarily due to investment gains experienced by the pension plan’s assets in 2009.   In 2011 and 2009, we incurred acquisition expenses of approximately $0.6 million in connection with The Bank of Asheville acquisition and $1.3 million in connection with the Cooperative Bank acquisition, respectively. Acquisition expenses for both periods consisted primarily of professional fees.   FDIC deposit insurance expense declined in each of the past two years. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, we incurred approximately $5.5 million, $4.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense. The $5.5 million in FDIC insurance expense for 2009 included a special assessment, which applied to all banks, of $1.6 million. As previously discussed, the FDIC changed its premium assessment methodology in April 2011, which was favorable for our company and reduced our expense in 2011.   Due to higher levels of delinquencies and foreclosure activity, including those associated with our covered assets, we recorded $5.5 million in repossession and collection expenses, net of FDIC reimbursements, in 2011, compared to $4.8 million in 2010 and $1.7 million in 2009.   Within the “non-credit losses” presented in Table 5, we recorded $1 million in 2011 in connection with a fraud loss.   Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes was $7.4 million in 2011, $5.0 million in 2010, and $37.6 million in 2009.   Table 6 presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 35.1% compared to 33.2% in 2010 and 38.4% in 2009. The variances in effective tax rates are primarily due to changes in the proportion of tax-exempt interest income to pretax income. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35% in 2012.   Stock-Based Compensation   We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock-based compensation.     45     Table of Contents         ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION   Overview   Over the past two years, our total assets have decreased from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009 to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011, which was primarily due to declines in our outstanding loans and deposits. Changes in our loans and deposit balances occur as a result of organic growth or decline, as well as acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2011, we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC-assisted failed bank transaction.

Positively impacting loans outstanding was our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville on January 21, 2011, which added $102 million in loans. However, this increase was more than offset by loan payoffs, foreclosures and loan charge-offs. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million that reduced our loan balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions. Also, loan demand in most of our market areas has remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations. In addition, we have de-emphasized certain types of lending, most notably acquisition and development land loans and non-owner occupied commercial real estate.     46     Table of Contents         However, for the first time since our loans outstanding began trending downward in 2008, we experienced sequential quarterly growth in our non-covered loan portfolio during each of the last two quarters of 2011, with non-covered loans increasing by $28 million during the last half of 2011. We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our SBLF preferred stock (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information).   To start 2011, our total deposits increased by $193 million as a result of the January acquisition of The Bank of Asheville. For the remainder of the year, as our loans declined, we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding, including internet deposits and time deposits, which resulted in generally declining deposit balances. Our lowest cost deposits, noninterest bearing demand accounts and NOW accounts, experienced positive internal growth of $24 million and $99 million, respectively. In addition to our bank-wide emphasis to grow these types of low-rate accounts, the increase in NOW accounts was impacted by $38 million in customer funds that were shifted from repurchase agreements (securities sold under agreements to repurchase) to NOW accounts during late 2011. In July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act repealed certain sections of the Federal Reserve Act that prohibited payment of interest on commercial demand deposits. With this prohibition removed, we began to pay interest on certain types of commercial demand accounts, and we encouraged our customers with repurchase agreements to switch to commercial NOW accounts, which eliminated the need to sell/pledge our investment securities.   For the same reasons as discussed above for 2011, we experienced a decline in loans of 7.5% in 2010. In 2010, we also experienced a decline in deposits of 9.6%, with most of the decline occurring in retail time deposits. Retail time deposits are generally a high cost source of funds for us, and during 2010 we decided not to match promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources, and consequently we experienced a loss of time deposits.   Also declining significantly in 2010 was our level of internet time deposits. Our level of time deposits gathered from internet posting services declined from $128 million at December 31, 2009 to $47 million at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of our internet deposits during 2010 were assumed in the Cooperative acquisition in 2009. Prior to its closing, Cooperative was prohibited from originating or renewing brokered deposits and accordingly, they enhanced liquidity by offering relatively high interest rates on internet posting services. As these time deposits have matured, the internet depositors, mostly credit unions, have elected not to renew the time deposits at the interest rates we have proposed. In 2010, we replaced most of the lost internet deposits with brokered deposits, which had more favorable interest rates. As a result, our brokered deposits increased from $76 million at December 31, 2009 to $144 million at December 31, 2010.   We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds in the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program. This program previously provided unlimited FDIC insurance for interest bearing transaction accounts earning interest rates up to 0.25%. Subsequent to this change, the only accounts with unlimited FDIC insurance are non-interest bearing transaction accounts.   Our overall liquidity increased slightly during 2011 compared to 2010. We experienced a $103 million increase in deposits, while loans decreased $24 million. With the excess deposits, we were able to reduce our borrowings by approximately $63 million during 2011. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to 15.7% at December 31, 2011.   Our capital ratios improved in 2011. All of our capital ratios have continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for “well-capitalized” status for all periods covered by this report.     47     Table of Contents         Due to the continued economic slowdown, our asset quality ratios remain at unfavorable levels compared to most of our company’s history. Our non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets ratio was 4.30% at December 31, 2011 compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010, and 3.10% at December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our ratio of net non-covered charge-offs to average non-covered loans was 1.52% compared to 1.55% for 2010, and 0.56% for 2009.   Distribution of Assets and Liabilities   Table 7 sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.   Our balance sheet distribution has remained relatively stable over the past three years. The increase in NOW deposits discussed earlier resulted in an increase in this category from 9% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010 to 13% in 2011. Also, over the past two years we have experienced a decline in retail time deposits less than $100,000 (“other time deposits”) that has resulted in other time deposits declining from 23% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in 2009 to 18% in 2011.   Securities   Information regarding our securities portfolio as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is presented in Tables 8 and 9.   The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for the vast majority of our investment securities from a third-party investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation service on a quarterly basis.   Total securities amounted to $240.6 million, $235.2 million, and $214.2 million, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   The majority of our “government-sponsored enterprise” securities are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank and carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature. At December 31, 2011, of the $35 million (carrying value) in government-sponsored enterprise securities, $21 million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $14 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system.   Our $124 million of mortgage-backed securities have all been issued by either Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the Small Business Administration, each of which are government-sponsored corporations. We have no “private label” mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans.   Included in mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2011 were collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) with an amortized cost of $1.5 million and a fair value of $1.5 million. The CMOs that we have invested in are substantially all “early tranche” portions of the CMOs, which minimizes our long-term interest rate risk.     48     Table of Contents         At December 31, 2011, our $12.5 million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following:       ($in thousands)           S&P Issuer       Maturity       Amortized       Market          Issuer           Ratings (1)       Date       Cost       Value          First Citizens Bancorp (South Carolina) Bond           Not Rated         4/1/15         $ 2,996           3,102            Bank of America Trust Preferred Security           BB         12/11/26           2,039           1,780            Bank of America Trust Preferred Security           BB         4/15/27           5,046           4,588            First Citizens Bancorp (North Carolina) Trust Preferred Security           BB         3/1/28           2,108           2,278            First Citizens Bancorp (South Carolina) Trust Preferred Security           Not Rated         6/15/34           1,000           740            Total investment in corporate bonds                         $ 13,189         12,488                     (1)     The ratings are as of January 26, 2012.   Substantially all of our investment in equity securities at each year end was comprised of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). The FHLB requires us to purchase their stock in order to borrow from them. The amount they require us to invest is based on our level of borrowings from them. At December 31, 2011, our investment in capital stock of the FHLB amounted to $10.9 million of our total investment in equity securities of $11.4 million. Until February 27, 2009, the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as borrowings were repaid. On February 27, 2009, the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when loans are repaid. Instead, they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis. During 2010 and 2011, the FHLB repurchased $1.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of their stock from the Company.   The fair value of securities held to maturity, which we carry at amortized cost, was $4,766,000 more than the carrying value at December 31, 2011 and $706,000 less than the carrying value at December 31, 2010. Our $58.0 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout our market area. We have only two municipal bonds with a denomination greater than $2,000,000 and we have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity, with the single largest exposure to any one entity being $3,700,000. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations.   At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, a net unrealized gain of $3,896,000, $2,478,000, and $1,832,000, respectively, was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale. During the past three years, interest rates have generally declined, which typically increases the value of our investment securities. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains, net of applicable deferred income taxes, of $2,376,000, $1,512,000, and $1,117,000 have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders’ equity (accumulated other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was 3.01% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds, the maturity date for all other non-mortgage-backed securities, and the expected life for mortgage-backed securities, was 5.2 years.   The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was 5.78% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities, was 6.6 years.     49     Table of Contents         The following table provides the names of issuers for which the Company has investment securities totaling in excess of 10% of shareholders’ equity and the fair value and amortized cost of these investments as of December 31, 2011. All of these securities are issued by government sponsored corporations.       ($ in thousands)                             Issuer       Amortized Cost       Fair Value       % of Shareholders’ Equity     Ginnie Mae       $ 66,888           70,016           20.3 %     Small Business Administration         39,034           39,055           11.3 %     Total       $ 105,922           109,071                 Loans   Table 10 provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends.   As previously discussed, in our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC, which afford us significant protection from losses on all loans and other real estate acquired in those acquisitions. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the financial risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans is significantly different from assets not covered under the loss share agreements. Accordingly, we present separately loans subject to the FDIC loss share agreements as “covered loans” and loans that are not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered loans.” Table 10a presents a breakout of covered and non-covered loans as of December 31, 2011.   The loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans. We restrict virtually all of our lending to our 36 county market area, which is located in western, central and eastern North Carolina, four counties in southern Virginia and five counties in northeastern South Carolina. The diversity of the region’s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment.   In 2011, loans outstanding decreased $23.7 million, or 1.0% to $2.43 billion. In 2010, loans outstanding decreased $198.7 million, or 7.5% to $2.45 billion. As previously discussed, the declines for both years were mainly due to loan payoffs and loan foreclosures exceeding new loan growth as loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak.   The majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans, with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising 86% to 90% of our outstanding loan balances. Except for real estate construction, land development and other land loans, the majority of our “real estate” loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower’s occupation or business is the primary repayment source, with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source.   Table 10 indicates that the two types of loans that have had the largest variances in the amount outstanding as a percent of total loans have been construction/land development loans and residential mortgage loans. In 2005 we expanded our branch network to what was then the fast-growing southeast coast of North Carolina, which had a high demand for construction and land development loans. In 2008, due to recessionary conditions, particularly in the new housing market, loan demand for these types of loans weakened and we tightened our loan underwriting criteria for these types of loans, which reduced growth. Due to economic conditions, for the past three years we have made very few new acquisition and land development loans, and we expect this trend to continue.     50     Table of Contents         Our concentration of residential mortgage loans increased in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, because Cooperative’s loan portfolio was heavily concentrated in residential mortgages.   In 2011, due to The Bank of Asheville acquisition, our percentage of commercial real estate loans increased slightly as that bank’s primary business had been commercial lending.   Table 11 provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods, with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately. Approximately 23% of our accruing loans outstanding at December 31, 2011 mature within one year and 67% of total loans mature within five years. As of December 31, 2011, the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were 47% and 53%, respectively. We intentionally make a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk.   Nonperforming Assets   Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and other real estate. As a matter of policy we place all loans that are past due 90 or more days on nonaccrual basis, and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were 90 days past due and still accruing interest.   Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful. Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because (i) interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income, (ii) future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and (iii) principal charged-off, if appropriate, may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms.   Table 12 summarizes our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, we present separately nonperforming assets subject to the loss share agreements as “covered” and nonperforming assets that are not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered.”   Due largely to the economic downturn that began in late 2007 and continued to worsen over the past few years, we have experienced increases in our non-covered nonperforming assets. Our total nonperforming assets were also significantly impacted by the Cooperative acquisition in 2009.   Table 12a presents our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 by general geographic region and further segregated into “covered” nonperforming assets and “non-covered” nonperforming assets. The majority of our nonperforming assets are located in the Eastern North Carolina region, which has experienced the most negative effects of the recession of any of our regions.   Non-covered nonperforming loans totaled $85.2 million, $96.0 million, and $83.5 million, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Total non-covered nonperforming loans as a percentage of total non-covered loans amounted to 4.12%, 4.61%, and 3.91%, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, non-covered troubled debt restructurings amounted to $11.7 million, $33.7 million, and $21.3 million, respectively. The decline in 2011 is primarily a result of troubled debt restructurings that re-defaulted and were placed on nonaccrual status. The increase in 2010 was the result of our initiative to work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by modifying certain loan terms.     51     Table of Contents         We also had $14.2 million and $14.4 million of covered troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to none in 2009.   The following is the composition, by loan type, of all of our nonaccrual loans at each period end, as classified for regulatory purposes:       ($ in thousands)       At December 31, 2011 (1)       At December 31, 2010 (1)     Commercial, financial, and agricultural       $ 3,300           2,595       Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans         48,467           54,781       Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages         24,133           36,715       Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit         7,255           8,584       Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other         28,491           17,578       Installment loans to individuals         3,392           539       Total nonaccrual loans       $ 115,038           120,792     (1) Includes both covered and non-covered loans.   The following segregates our nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2011 into covered and non-covered loans, as classified for regulatory purposes:       ($ in thousands)       Covered Nonaccrual Loans       Non-covered Nonaccrual  Loans       Total Nonaccrual Loans     Commercial, financial, and agricultural       $ 469           2,831           3,300       Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans         21,203           27,264           48,467       Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages         10,134           13,999           24,133       Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit         1,231           6,024           7,255       Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other         8,212           20,279           28,491       Installment loans to individuals         223           3,169           3,392       Total nonaccrual loans       $ 41,472           73,566           115,038     The following segregates our nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 into covered and non-covered loans, as classified for regulatory purposes:       ($ in thousands)       Covered Nonaccrual Loans       Non-covered Nonaccrual Loans       Total Nonaccrual Loans     Commercial, financial, and agricultural       $ 163           2,432           2,595       Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans         30,846           23,935           54,781       Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages         16,343           20,372           36,715       Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit         4,059           4,525           8,584       Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other         7,039           10,539           17,578       Installment loans to individuals         16           523           539       Total nonaccrual loans       $ 58,466           62,326           120,792     The tables above indicate that covered nonaccrual loans declined from $58.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $41.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily a result of many of the nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 being either charged-off or being foreclosed upon in 2011 and their balances being transferred to other real estate during the year.   Non-covered nonaccrual loans increased from $62.3 million at December 31, 2010 to $73.6 million at December 31, 2011, which was the result of continued economic hardship in our market areas, particularly for the commercial real estate business.     52     Table of Contents         If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $8,724,000, $8,136,000 and $9,800,000 for nonaccrual loans and $1,873,000, $1,943,000 and $1,200,000 for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $2,578,000, $3,195,000 and $2,147,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status), and $1,351,000, $1,342,000, and $866,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming.   Management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that, in management’s opinion, have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans. In addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above, management believes that an estimated $5 million of non-covered loans and $16 million of covered loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December 31, 2011 have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general. Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 (see discussion below).   Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources, or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms.   Other real estate includes foreclosed, repossessed, and idled properties. Non-covered other real estate has increased over the past three years, amounting to $37.0 million at December 31, 2011, $21.1 million at December 31, 2010, and $8.8 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we also held $85.3 million, $94.9 million and $47.4 million, respectively, in other real estate that is subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC. We believe that the fair values of the items of other real estate, less estimated costs to sell, equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented.   The following table presents the detail of our other real estate at each of the past two year ends:             At December 31, 2011 (1)       At December 31, 2010 (1)     Vacant land       $ 76,341           81,185       1-4 family residential properties         33,724           28,146       Commercial real estate         12,230           6,641       Other         —           —       Total other real estate       $ 122,295           115,972     (1) Includes both covered and non-covered real estate.     53     Table of Contents         The following segregates our other real estate at December 31, 2011 into covered and non-covered:             Covered Other Real Estate       Non-covered Other Real Estate       Total Other Real Estate     Vacant land       $ 59,994           16,347           76,341       1-4 family residential properties         17,362           16,362           33,724       Commercial real estate         7,916           4,314           12,230       Other         —           —           —       Total other real estate       $ 85,272           37,023           122,295     The following segregates our other real estate at December 31, 2010 into covered and non-covered:             Covered Other Real Estate       Non-covered Other Real Estate       Total Other Real Estate     Vacant land       $ 72,878           8,307           81,185       1-4 family residential properties         18,691           9,455           28,146       Commercial real estate         3,322           3,319           6,641       Other         —           —           —       Total other real estate       $ 94,891           21,081           115,972     Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience   The allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations (known as a “provision for loan losses” for the period in which the charge is taken). Losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans, in management’s opinion, become uncollectible. The recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance. We consider our procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy. See the heading “Critical Accounting Policies” above for further discussion.   The factors that influence management’s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions.   We use a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. In this program, credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an independent third party consulting firm. The testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses, loans past due 90 days or more, loans originated by new loan officers, nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations.   We strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market areas. Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies. We have no foreign loans, few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions. Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries. The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as “real estate” loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan. Collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within our principal market area.   The allowance for loan losses amounted to $41.4 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $49.4 million at December 31, 2010 and $37.3 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $5.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses is attributable to covered loans that have exhibited credit quality deterioration due to lower collateral valuations, while the allowance for loan losses for non-covered loans amounted to $35.6 million and $38.3 million at those dates. For all prior periods, the entire allowance for loan losses is attributable to non-covered loans.     54     Table of Contents         The ratio of the allowance for non-covered loan losses to non-covered loans was 1.72%, 1.84%, and 1.75%, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The decrease in the percentage for 2011 is primarily attributable to lower specific reserves at December 31, 2011. The increased allowance percentage in 2010 was necessary due to the higher level of delinquencies and classified and nonperforming loans.   Table 13 sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated. The amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories. Table 13a segregates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 into covered and non-covered categories. As indicated in Tables 13 and 13a, the amount of the allowance allocated to “Real Estate – Construction and Land Development” declined by $5-$6 million from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This decline was due to charge-offs and the foreclosure and transfer to “other real estate” of a significant amount of covered land development loans.   Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date. It must be emphasized, however, that the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans. No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of conditions and factors then prevailing, will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings.   In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations.   For the years indicated, Table 14 summarizes our balances of loans outstanding, average loans outstanding, and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses.   Table 14a presents a detailed rollforward of the 2011 and 2010 activity for the allowance for loan losses segregated into covered and non-covered activity.   Net loan charge-offs of non-covered loans amounted to $31.2 million in 2011, $32.7 million in 2010, and $12.1 million in 2009. The elevated amounts in 2010 and 2011 reflect the impact of deteriorating loan quality that has been impacted by the economic downturn. Also in 2010 and 2011, we recorded $8.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loans losses, but did not record charge-offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon. Net non-covered charge-offs as a percentage of average non-covered loans represented 1.52%, 1.55%, and 0.56%, during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   We recorded $18.1 million and $9.8 million in charge-offs of covered loans during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals that reflected lower valuations.     55     Table of Contents         Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase   At December 31, 2011, deposits outstanding amounted to $2.755 billion, an increase of $103 million from December 31, 2010. To begin 2011, deposits initially grew by $193 million as a result of the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. For the remainder of the year, our deposit base declined by $90 million as a lack of loan growth allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits. Our NOW deposits increased approximately $131 million during 2011, with $31 million being assumed in The Bank of Asheville acquisition and another $38 million of the growth resulting from customers shifting their funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to a commercial interest bearing NOW account (discussed earlier). In 2011, despite the addition of $62 million in time deposits and $43 million in internet deposits from The Bank of Asheville acquisition, we experienced overall net declines in these categories of $73 million and $17 million, respectively, due to our ability to lessen our reliance on these higher cost deposits as a result of weak loan demand and growth in our other lower-cost deposit categories.   In 2010, deposits declined from $2.933 billion to $2.653 billion, a decrease of $281 million, or 9.6%, from December 31, 2009. Approximately $237 million, or 84%, of the decline in deposits was attributable to decreases in time deposits. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds during the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program.   The nature of our deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page 46. The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends:               2011       2010       2009     Noninterest-bearing deposits         12 %         11 %         9 %     NOW deposits         15 %         11 %         12 %     Money market deposits         19 %         19 %         17 %     Savings deposits         5 %         6 %         5 %     Brokered deposits         6 %         5 %         3 %     Internet deposits         1 %         2 %         4 %     Time deposits > $100,000 - retail         21 %         23 %         24 %     Time deposits < $100,000 - retail         21 %         23 %         26 %     Total deposits         100 %         100 %         100 %     Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as     a percent of total deposits         1 %         2 %         2 %    The deposit mix remained relatively consistent from 2009 to 2011. Our mix has gradually shifted over the past few years to a heavier concentration in transaction accounts and less concentration in our time deposits. The percentages for retail time deposits have declined because we have chosen not to match certain promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources. Our growth in other categories of deposits and our weak loan demand eliminated the need to match the higher competitor rates.   We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services.   Table 15 presents the average amounts of our deposits and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.     56     Table of Contents         As of December 31, 2011, we held approximately $753.2 million in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Table 16 is a maturity schedule of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2011. This table shows that 66% of our time deposits greater than $100,000 mature within one year.   At each of the past three year ends, we have no deposits issued through foreign offices, nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors.   Borrowings   We had borrowings outstanding of $133.9 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $196.9 million at December 31, 2010 and $176.8 million at December 31, 2009. Borrowings decreased from 2010 to 2011 primarily as a result of a decline in loans and growth in deposits that provided funds to pay down our borrowings. During most of 2010, we held a lower level of borrowings until late in the year when we obtained borrowings to offset a portion of the liquidity decline we experienced as a result of the loss of deposits that was previously discussed. Table 2 shows that average borrowings were $122.7 million in 2011 compared to $79.8 million in 2010 and $151.2 million in 2009.   At December 31, 2011, the Company had four sources of readily available borrowing capacity – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, of which $88 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $62 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $33 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s (FRB) discount window, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $55 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4) a $10 million holding company line of credit with a commercial bank (none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010).   Our line of credit with the FHLB can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by our FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, none of the $88 million outstanding with the FHLB were overnight borrowings. All the FHLB borrowings were at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 1.36% and maturity dates ranging from April 2012 to June 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately $76 million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 1.49%. The maximum amount of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011 was $92 million.   In addition to the outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, our borrowing capacity was further reduced by $203 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each of those dates.   Our correspondent bank relationship allows us to purchase up to $50 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). We had no borrowings under this line at December 31, 2011. We had $33 million outstanding under this line at December 31, 2010 with a weighted average interest rate of 0.65%. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month-end during 2011.   We also have a line of credit with the FRB discount window. This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate loans). Based on the collateral that we owned as of December 31, 2011, the available line of credit was approximately $79 million. At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line. At December 31, 2010, we had $55 million in borrowings outstanding under this line. There were no FRB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011.     57     Table of Contents         At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a $10 million holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by 100% of the common stock of our bank subsidiary. This line of credit expires and is subject to renewal in March of each year. The line of credit had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2011 or 2010, and was not drawn upon during 2011 or 2010.   In addition to the lines of credit described above, in which we had $88 million and $150 million outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, we also had a total of $46.4 million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010. We have initiated three trust preferred security issuances since 2002 totaling $67.0 million, with one of those issuances for $20.6 million being redeemed in 2007. These borrowings each have 30 year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date. We issued $20.6 million of this debt on October 29, 2002 (which we called in 2007), an additional $20.6 million on December 19, 2003, and $25.8 million on April 13, 2006. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70% for the securities issued in 2003, and three-month LIBOR plus 1.39% for the securities issued in 2006.   Liquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies   We have a pending agreement to purchase eleven branches of another bank with approximately $180 million in total deposits and $98 million in total loans. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.   Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds, and our ability to maintain required reserve levels, pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments. Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash.   As noted above, in addition to internally generated liquidity sources, we currently (March 2012) have the ability to obtain borrowings from the following four sources – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the FRB’s discount window and 4) a holding company line of credit with a limit of $10 million.   Our overall liquidity increased slightly during 2011 compared to 2010. Our loans decreased by $24 million, while our deposits increased by $103 million. As a result, our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to 15.7% at December 31, 2011.   We continue to believe our liquidity sources, including unused lines of credit, are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate.   In the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows.   Table 18 reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Any of our $88 million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in our condition or if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement.     58     Table of Contents         In the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the financial statements. The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December 31, 2011:       ($ in millions)                                                           Type of Commitment       Fixed Rate       Variable Rate       Total     Outstanding closed-end loan commitments       $ 39           278           317       Unfunded commitments on revolving lines of credit, credit cards and home equity loans         32           185           217       Total       $ 71           463           534     At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we also had $7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a guarantee made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above. In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already executed by the customer, becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, we have had to honor only a few standby letters of credit, which involved insignificant amounts of funds and have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any loss to us. We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations.   It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits, thus not requiring any net cash outflow. Based on that assumption, management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations.   We are not involved in any legal proceedings that, in management’s opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company.   Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity   Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 amounted to $345.2 million compared to $344.6 million at December 31, 2010. The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders’ equity are net income, which increases shareholders’ equity, and dividends declared, which decreases shareholders’ equity. Additionally, any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders’ equity.   In 2011, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were the redemption of $65.0 million of our Series A Preferred Stock issued under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program (also known as TARP) and the simultaneous issuance of $63.5 million of Series B Preferred Stock under the Treasury’s Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). Net income of $13.6 million for 2011 increased equity, while common stock dividends declared of $5.4 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.2 million reduced equity. We also recorded accretion of the discount on preferred stock of $2.9 million due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. (See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions.) Another significant factor negatively impacting equity in 2011 was a $4.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss that was caused by an increase in our pension liability. The increase in the pension liability was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on the actuarial calculations involved in determining the liability. Our policy is to use the Citigroup Pension Index yield curve in the computation of the pension liability. At December 31, 2011, that index had a weighted average rate of 4.39%, which was a decline from the rate of 5.59% at December 31, 2010. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity.     59     Table of Contents         In 2010, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were net income of $10.0 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.4 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.3 million, which reduced equity. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity.   In 2009, the most significant item that impacted our equity was our issuance of $65 million in preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, other significant factors were net income of $60.3 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.3 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.2 million, which reduced equity. See the consolidated financial statements for other less significant factors that impacted equity in 2009.   We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations.   The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of “Tier 1” capital to total risk-weighted assets (“Tier I Capital Ratio”) and total capital to risk-weighted assets (“Total Capital Ratio”) of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders’ equity, excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale, less intangible assets, and total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus certain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted assets refer to the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in FRB and FDIC regulations.   In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described above, the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined above) to quarterly average total assets (“Leverage Ratio) of 3.00% to 5.00%, depending upon the institution’s composite ratings as determined by its regulators. The FRB has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to the Company.   Table 21 presents our regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report.   In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above, the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank’s classification as “well capitalized.” The specific guidelines are as follows – Tier I Capital Ratio of at least 6.00%, Total Capital Ratio of at least 10.00%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5.00%. If a bank falls below “well capitalized” status in any of these three ratios, it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits. The Bank’s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for “well-capitalized” status at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 – see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a table that presents the Bank’s regulatory ratios.     60     Table of Contents         In addition to shareholders’ equity, we have supplemented our capital in past years with trust preferred security debt issuances, which because of their structure qualify as regulatory capital. This was necessary in past years because our balance sheet growth outpaced the growth rate of our capital. Additionally, we have frequently purchased bank branches over the years that resulted in our recording intangible assets, which negatively impacted regulatory capital ratios. As discussed in “Borrowings” above, we have issued a total of $67.0 million in trust preferred securities since 2002, with the most recent issuance being a $25.8 million issuance that occurred in April 2006. We currently have $46.4 million in trust preferred securities outstanding.   In this economic environment, our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least 200 basis points higher than the “well-capitalized” thresholds set for banks. At December 31, 2011, our total risk-based capital ratio was 16.72% compared to the 10.00% “well-capitalized” threshold.   In addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (“TCE Ratio”). Our TCE ratio was 6.58% at December 31, 2011 compared to 6.52% at December 31, 2010.   See “Supervision and Regulation” under “Business” above and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect our capital resources.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments   Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities.   Derivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. We have not engaged in derivatives activities through December 31, 2011 and have no current plans to do so.   Return on Assets and Equity   Table 20 shows return on assets (net income available to common shareholders divided by average total assets), return on common equity (net income available to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders’ equity), dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by net income per common share) and shareholders’ equity to assets ratio (average total shareholders’ equity divided by average total assets) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011.   Interest Rate Risk (Including Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Item 7A.)   Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings. Notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits, our level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to our various categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It is our policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection, to the extent practical, against wide interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard GAP reports, maturity reports, and an asset/liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates, expected future interest rates, and various intervals of “shock” interest rates. Over the years, we have been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets (net interest margin). Over the past five calendar years, our net interest margin has ranged from a low of 3.74% (realized in 2008) to a high of 4.72% (realized in 2011). During that five year period, the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of 3.25% (which was the rate as of December 31, 2011) to a high of 8.25%. The consistency of the net interest margin is aided by the relatively low level of long-term interest rate exposure that we maintain. At December 31, 2011, approximately 82% of our interest-earning assets are subject to repricing within five years (because they are either adjustable rate assets or they are fixed rate assets that mature) and substantially all of our interest-bearing liabilities reprice within five years.     61     Table of Contents         Table 17 sets forth our interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011, using stated maturities for all fixed rate instruments except mortgage-backed securities (which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback) and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called (which are shown in the period of their expected call). As illustrated by this table, at December 31, 2011, we had $682 million more in interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets. This generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment. However, this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings, market value, or management actions. Also, interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. In addition to the effects of “when” various rate-sensitive products reprice, market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products. For example, included in interest-bearing liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at December 31, 2011 are deposits totaling $1.084 billion comprised of NOW, savings, and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management. These types of deposits historically have not repriced with, or in the same proportion, as general market indicators.   Overall we believe that in the near term (twelve months), net interest income will not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates. Similarly, we would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates. Generally, when rates change, our interest-sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change, while our interest-sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change. In the short-term (less than six months), this results in us being asset-sensitive, meaning that our net interest income benefits from an increase in interest rates and is negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates. However, in the twelve-month horizon, the impact of having a higher level of interest-sensitive liabilities lessens the short-term effects of changes in interest rates.   The Federal Reserve has made no changes to interest rates since 2008, and since that time the difference between market driven short-term interest rates and longer-term interest rates has generally widened, with short-term interest rates steadily declining and longer term interest rates not declining by as much. The higher long term interest rate environment enhanced our ability to require higher interest rates on loans. As it relates to funding, we have been able to reprice many of our maturing time deposits at lower interest rates. We were also able to generally decrease the rates we paid on other categories of deposits as a result of declining short-term interest rates in the marketplace and an increase in liquidity that lessened our need to offer premium interest rates. Our net interest margin increased throughout 2010 and 2011. Our net interest margin was 4.72% for 2011, a 33 basis point increase from the 4.39% margin realized in 2010.   As previously discussed in the section “Net Interest Income,” our net interest income was impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments related primarily to our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville. The purchase accounting adjustments related to the premium amortization on loans, deposits and borrowings are based on amortization schedules and are thus systematic and predictable. The accretion of the loan discount on loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, which amounted to $11.6 million and $7.6 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, is less predictable and could be materially different among periods. This is because of the magnitude of the discounts that were initially recorded ($280 million in total) and the fact that the accretion being recorded is dependent on both the credit quality of the acquired loans and the impact of any accelerated loan repayments, including payoffs. If the credit quality of the loans declines, some, or all, of the remaining discount will cease to be accreted into income. If the underlying loans experience accelerated paydowns or are paid off, the remaining discount will be accreted into income on an accelerated basis, which in the event of total payoff will result in the remaining discount being entirely accreted into income in the period of the payoff. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and susceptible to volatility.     62     Table of Contents         Based on our most recent interest rate modeling, which assumes no changes in interest rates for 2012 (federal funds rate = 0.25%, prime = 3.25%), we project that our net interest margin for 2012 will remain relatively consistent with the net interest margins recently realized. With interest rates having been stable for a relatively long period of time, most of our interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities have been repriced at rates near today’s interest rates.   We have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes, nor do we maintain any foreign currency positions. Table 19 presents the expected maturities of our other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments. Table 19 also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Our assets and liabilities have estimated fair values that do not materially differ from their carrying amounts.   See additional discussion regarding net interest income, as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin, in the section entitled “Net Interest Income” above.   Inflation   Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature (payable in fixed determinable amounts), the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same. The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses.   Current Accounting Matters   We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”). Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic, the FASB frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) reviews significant factors with respect to our financial condition and results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. The following MD&A concerning our operations is intended to satisfy three principal objectives: Provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to see the company through the eyes of management;    Enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which our financial information should be analyzed; and,   Provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. Management’s discussion and analysis, like other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. However, our anticipated future financial performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis should be considered in light of that cautionary statement.   This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes, tables, and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. All figures are in thousands, except per share data and per employee data.       16     Table of Contents      EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW   Results of Operations   Earnings reached a record high of $3.37 per share in 2011 (on net income of $5,305) compared to earnings of $3.04 per share in 2010 (on net income of $4,754), an increase of 11% per share. During 2011, higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income $386, or 2%, while credit and foreclosure costs remained historically high at $2,587 compared to $2,644 during 2010. Noninterest and fee income during 2011 was largely unchanged compared to 2010, while operating expenses, excluding loss on foreclosed assets, declined $495, or 3%, from $277 lower FDIC insurance premium expense and $145 lower debit card losses following a significant fraud loss during 2010.   During 2011, total nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1%, due to a $3,837 increase in troubled debt that has been restructured but continues to pay according to its restructured terms. However, nonaccrual assets decreased $315, or 3.5%, and foreclosed assets decreased $2,028, or 40.8% during 2011. Total nonperforming assets were $17,883, or 2.87% of total assets as of December 31, 2011 compared $16,389, or 2.64% of total assets as of December 31, 2010.   During 2012, we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during 2011, based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin. While interest rates are not expected to change significantly during 2012, an initial period of rising interest rates should be expected to reduce net interest margin and potentially net interest income as funding costs increase with rising rates but floating rate loan yields remain at their floors for a time. In addition, a falling rate environment would lower loan yields to a greater extent than further deposit price reductions, pressuring net interest margin and income. During 2012, credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write-down of foreclosed asset values compared to 2011. However, we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned. Due to stabilization of historically low long-term interest rates on residential mortgages, we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during 2012. In addition, regulatory changes effective during 2010 for overdraft fee income and in 2011 for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during 2012. Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs. Taken together, net income growth during 2012 is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during 2011 and 2010.   Earnings were $3.04 per share in 2010 (on net income of $4,754) compared to earnings of $2.00 per share in 2009 (on net income of $3,116). During 2010, higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income $2,103, or 12%, while income also benefited from a $2,186, or 45%, decline in credit and foreclosure losses compared to 2009. Net interest income increased primarily from maintenance of interest rate floors on adjustable rate loans while deposit costs continued to fall. Offsetting this increase to income was decreased noninterest and fee income, down $213 during 2010, or 4%, primarily from 2009 recognition of a $521 gain on sale of securities. Operating expenses increased $1,096, or 7%, and included increased salaries and employee benefits of $1,015, up 14%, and higher all other operating expenses (excluding foreclosure costs) of $362, or 6%. Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily from an annual increase in base pay, fewer deferred loan origination costs, and increased year-end incentive and profit sharing expense based on net income levels achieved.   Earnings were $2.00 per share in 2009 (on net income of $3,116) compared to earnings of $2.13 per share in 2008 (on net income of $3,301). However, both years experienced nonrecurring items related to sale of securities and disposal of premises and equipment. Pro-forma net income before these special items was $2,859 in 2009 and $3,909 in 2008, a net income decline of 27% during 2009. The 2009 decline was due to significantly higher provision for loan losses, loss on sale of foreclosed assets, and higher FDIC insurance expense. Offsetting a portion of these increased expenses during 2009 were increases in net interest income from higher net interest margin and record levels of mortgage banking income. Each of these factors was influenced by falling market interest rates occurring during the national recession then in effect.   Liquidity   Total assets increased $1,774, or less than 1%, to $622,867 at December 31, 2011 compared to $621,093 at December 31, 2010. While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged, disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased $5,221, or 5%. Total net loans receivable increased $5,756, or 1%, to $437,557 at December 31, 2011. Offsetting this increase in assets was a $4,154 decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets. Asset growth during 2012 is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt. Core deposits increased $14,872 during 2011 from a $17,366 increase in year-end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Increased 2011 deposits were used to repay $11,820 of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year-end. Wholesale borrowings, including brokered and national deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale repurchase agreements increased $425 during 2011. Wholesale borrowings were $138,190 at December 31, 2011 compared to $137,765 at December 31, 2010.   Our most significant sources of liquidity and wholesale funding include federal funds purchased from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, brokered and national certificates of deposit, and Federal Discount Window advances. In addition to the federal funds sold position of $21,571, we have $237,982 of unused funding available at December 31, 2011, which is considered adequate to meet customer, operational, and growth needs during 2012. Most of our wholesale funding sources require either pledging of assets, maintenance of well-capitalized regulatory status, or additional purchases of FHLB capital stock (or all of these items) to continue or expand participation in the funding program. In particular, $42,099 of potential FHLB advance funding considered available at December 31, 2011, would require additional purchase of up to $2,105 of their capital stock, which pays a nominal dividend and for which no trading market exists.       17     Table of Contents      Due in part to an expected reduction to future debit card income in response to Dodd-Frank legislation and a qualifying account structure which required payment of a significantly greater than market rate of interest, we discontinued sale of our Rewards Checking product during 2011. Rewards Checking was a retail high yield interest bearing checking account with account usage qualifications to earn the premium interest rate. Qualifications included receipt of the monthly account statement via email, at least 10 debit card purchases per month, and at least 1 electronic transfer per month. During 2011, Rewards Checking paid qualifying accounts a 2.01% annual percentage yield on the first $25,000 of balance and reimbursed customer ATM fees. Since its introduction during 2007, Rewards Checking had been our primary source of retail deposit growth. Absence of the Reward Checking product from our retail deposit product line could negatively impact future deposit growth.   Total assets increased $14,239, or 2%, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The majority of the increase was in cash and cash equivalents, up $13,994, as core deposits increased $16,186, or 5%. The core deposit increase in 2010 was driven by a $9,989 increase in our Rewards Checking high yielding NOW account and a large $7,167 commercial money market account opened during 2010 by a related party. A decline in net loans receivable of $5,832, or 1%, primarily from lower commercial related loans was offset by increased investment securities and purchased bank certificates of deposit totaling $4,678, up 4%. An increase in other borrowings and stockholders’ equity of $7,521 along with the increase in deposits previously mentioned contributed to a reduction in wholesale deposits and FHLB advances of $11,089 during 2010. Brokered deposits, FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements were $137,765 at December 31, 2010, down $18,089, or 12%, from $155,854 at December 31, 2009   Capital Resources   We are considered well-capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of 14.99% at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.27% at December 31, 2010 and 12.49% at December 31, 2009. Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of 10.00% to be considered well-capitalized. During 2011, regulatory capital increased from higher retained earnings (up 14% over earnings retained during 2010) while risk adjusted assets increased just 2%. During 2010, total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to 50% risk weighting, rather than the 100% risk weighting assigned in prior years. In addition, we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during 2010 which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio. These changes, along with retained 2010 net income, increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than 2009. On a book basis, total tangible common equity reflected on the December 31, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheets was 8.09% compared to 7.52% at December 31, 2010 and 6.97% at December 31, 2009. In response to Dodd-Frank legislation, banking regulatory agencies are expected to announce higher minimum capital standards for banks to be considered well capitalized during 2012.   We issued $7,000 of 8% senior subordinated notes during 2009 which may be repaid in full during 2012 at our option and mature in 2019. Approximately 21% of our total regulatory capital is comprised of debt instruments including junior and senior debentures and notes which, unlike common stock, require quarterly payments of interest. Therefore, although no current plans exist, future capital needs during the next several years would likely be met by issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock as needed. We expect to continue to pay our traditional semi-annual cash dividend assuming continued profitable operations and projections of adequate future capital levels for growth and credit risk. In addition, any future growth through merger and acquisition activities should be expected to drain excess capital levels and could increase the likelihood of a new common or preferred stock capital raise, potentially diluting existing stockholders.   Several years of low asset growth and high earnings levels have raised book and regulatory capital ratios to historically high levels. For example, our total regulatory capital ratio has increased from 10.63% at December 31, 2008 to 14.99% at December 31, 2011. Due to projected low levels of organic loan growth available in our existing markets and expectations for improving problem loan trends, we are evaluating actions which could utilize excess capital to build shareholder value. Our primary focus is on market and core deposit expansion via merger and acquisition of other banks with relatively low credit risk profiles and near our current markets. If value added merger and acquisition options do not materialize in the near term, we may consider repayment of our existing senior subordinated notes or resumption of our traditional stock repurchase program on the open market. Such actions would decrease existing capital ratios but would be expected to increase net income or net book value per share.   Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Our largest volume off-balance sheet activity involves our servicing of payments and related collection activities on approximately $262 million of residential 1 to 4 family mortgages sold to FHLB and FNMA, up $2 million from $260 million at December 31, 2010. Serviced mortgage loans increased from customer refinance activity, a trend which began during 2009 when serviced loans increased $52 million, or 28%, and continued with serviced loans increasing $22 million, or 9.4% during 2010. As expected we experienced significantly slower growth during 2011 and we may not see significant organic growth in serviced loans in future years. Proposals by the U.S. Treasury concerning FNMA and the FHLB could reduce the amount of annual servicing income (currently .25% of serviced mortgage balances annually) paid to us to service future mortgages originated and sold to them.       18     Table of Contents      We have provided a credit enhancement against FHLB loss on approximately 20% of the serviced principal, up to a maximum guarantee of $1.9 million in the aggregate. However, we would incur such loss only if the FHLB first lost $1.9 million on this loan pool of approximately $52 million. No sold loans have received our credit enhancement guarantee of principal since October 2008 and we have no intentions of originating future loans with the guarantee. Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in 2000, only $0.3 million of $425 million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss, all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account.   All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities. Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations. During 2011, we experienced a $37 loss from repurchase of a foreclosed loan with underwriting violations related to private mortgage insurance. We reviewed our remaining portfolio of loans with similar origination circumstances and do not have a material exposure to future loss for loans underwritten in the same manner. Absent this 2011 loss, we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since 2000 and have not been required to repurchase any other loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expected to be required to repurchase loans in the near term.   We provide various commitments to extend credit for both commercial and consumer purposes totaling approximately $99 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $98 million at December 31, 2010. These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon.   Our primary long-term contractual obligations are related to repayment of funding sources such as FHLB advances, long-term other borrowings, and customer time deposits, which make up 93% of our total long-term contractual obligations. For all contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2011, 34% will require repayment or refinancing during 2012 although virtually 100% of these 2012 obligations represent time deposits taken in the normal course of business.   During 2011, we originated a program to offer certain high credit quality customers fixed interest rate swaps to hedge their risk on variable rate commercial real estate loans with us. Fixed interest rate swaps sold to customers (in which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate) are simultaneously offset by our purchase of a variable interest rate swap from a correspondent bank (in which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate). Such swap sale programs are often referred to “back to back” interest rate swaps as the resulting fixed interest rate risk with our customer is offset by our variable rate risk with our counterparty. At December 31, 2011, there were $14,324 in back to back swaps outstanding with variable rate commercial real estate loan customers.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Earnings   Table 1 of Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K presents various financial performance ratios and measures for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011. A number of separate or nonrecurring factors impacted our earnings during 2007 through 2009 but none have had a significant impact to net income during 2011 and 2010. Table 2 presents our net income for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011, before certain tax-adjusted nonrecurring income and expense items.   Table 2: Summary Operating Income       Years ended December 31,       2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                                                               Net income before special items, net of tax       $ 5,277         $ 4,770         $ 2,859         $ 3,909         $ 3,932                                                                         Net gain (loss) on write-down and sale of securities         19           (12 )         316           (600 )         –       Net gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment         9           (4 )         (59 )         (8 )         8       Reduction to tax expense from favorable Tax Court decision         –           –           –           –           200                                                                         Net income       $ 5,305         $ 4,754         $ 3,116         $ 3,301         $ 4,140                                                                         Diluted earnings per share before special items       $ 3.35         $ 3.05         $ 1.83         $ 2.52         $ 2.50                                                                         Diluted earnings per share as reported       $ 3.37         $ 3.04         $ 2.00         $ 2.13         $ 2.64         19     Table of Contents        2011 compared to 2010   Net earnings during 2011 were $5,305, or $3.37 per diluted share, compared to $4,754, or $3.04 per diluted share during 2010, an increase of $551 ($.33 per share), up 11.6%. 2011 net income increased over the prior year due to increased net interest income of $458, up 2.4%, due to a slight increase in net margin and average earning assets. Credit costs totaled $2,587 during 2011, a slight decline of $57, or 2.2%, compared to 2010, primarily from lower provision for loan losses while loss on foreclosed assets increased from higher partial write-downs of value. Noninterest income decreased $26 during 2011, or 0.5%, from a decline in service charges (primarily overdraft charges) and mortgage banking totaling $253 which was partially offset by $207 in swap sale commission income (a new product during 2011). Excluding credit costs, noninterest expenses declined $495, or 3.3%, primarily from a $277 reduction in FDIC insurance premiums. Return on average assets was .87% and .79% during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.78% and 10.59% during 2011 and 2010, respectively.   During 2012, we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during 2011, based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin. During 2012, credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write-down of foreclosed asset values compared to 2011. However, we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned. Due to stabilization of historically low long-term interest rates on residential mortgages, we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during 2012. In addition, regulatory changes effective during 2010 for overdraft fee income and during 2011 for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during 2012. We expect 2012 noninterest income to be less than 2011 due to these factors. Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs. Taken together, net income growth during 2012 is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during 2011 and 2010.   2010 compared to 2009   Earnings reached a then record high of $3.04 per share during 2010, an increase of 52% over 2009 earnings of $2.00 per share. Increased earnings were led by higher net interest income of $2,148 (up 12.7% from increased net interest margin) and significantly lower credit and foreclosure costs, down $2,186 (45%) from 2009. 2010 earnings also benefited from continued high levels of mortgage banking refinance income, which although less than in 2009, continued at historically high levels. Service fees increased $338, or 23.3% from changes to our customer courtesy overdraft program during 2010 which recognized increased customer overdraft activity.   These increases to income were offset by higher salaries and employee benefits, up $1,105 (13.6%) from several factors including an annual increase in base wages, lower deferral of direct loan origination expenses, and higher year-end incentive costs from meeting income growth goals. Data processing costs increased $217, or 22.7%, due in part to conversion to a new service bureau data processing system and related training and implementation costs. Because the initial data processing contract called for reduced fees during the initial implementation period, data processing fees are expected to increase significantly during 2011.   Return on average assets was .79% and .54% during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.59% and 7.38% during 2010 and 2009, respectively.   2009 compared to 2008   Earnings were $2.00 per share during 2009 on net income of $3,116 which declined 6% from 2008 earnings of $2.13 per share on net income of 3,301. However, earnings per share before special or nonrecurring items were $1.83 in 2009 on pro-forma net income of $2,859 compared to $2.52 in 2008 on pro-forma net income of $3,909, a decline of $1,050, or 27%. The net decline in 2009 was due primarily to significantly greater credit related costs including combined provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed assets expense of $4,830 during 2009 compared to $891 in 2008, an increase of over 500%. These increased credit costs reduced 2009 net income by approximately $2,387 after income tax benefits compared to 2008. During 2009, a national economic recession that began during 2008 reduced borrower ability to repay loans due to us, increasing current net charge offs during 2009 as well as our expectation of future charge offs from existing economic factors in effect at that time. The majority of the loss on foreclosed assets was a $1,004 loss on a large land development foreclosure taken to auction during 2009.   In addition to credit losses, FDIC insurance expense premiums increased from $284 in 2008 to $986 in 2009 as Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserves declined from payouts to certain depositors of failed banks in the United States. FDIC insured banks as an industry were required to pay increased quarterly premiums as well as a special assessment to recapitalize the DIF. Increased 2009 FDIC insurance expense lowered net income by approximately $425 after tax benefits compared to 2008.   Offsetting these increased expenses, tax adjusted net interest income and mortgage banking income increased $3,365 during 2009 compared to 2008 due to falling market interest rates caused by the economic recession. The low interest rate environment prompted customers to refinance residential mortgages with us which we subsequently sold on the secondary market. We also increased net interest income as very low short-term interest rates were used to fund moderately longer dated and higher yielding loans and securities including adjustable rate loans with interest rate floors. These factors increased 2009 net income by approximately $2,039 after tax expense.       20     Table of Contents      Return on average assets was .54% and .61% during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 7.38% and 8.63% during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the 2008 FNMA preferred stock write-down, return on average assets would have been .72% during 2008 and return on average equity would have been 10.20%.   Balance Sheet Changes and Analysis   Summary balance sheets at December 31 for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011 are presented in Table 1 of Item 6 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total assets increased $1,774, or 0.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2011, after increasing $14,239 (2.3%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 and increasing $36,368 (6.4%) during the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2011 asset growth rate continued a decline first seen during 2010 related to low customer loan demand as customers sought to reduce their debt obligations amidst economic uncertainty. Presented in Table 3 below is a summary balance sheet for the five years ended December 31, 2011 as a percentage of total assets.   Table 3: Summary Balance Sheet as a Percent of Total Assets       As of December 31,       2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                                                               Cash and cash equivalents         6.1 %         6.5 %         4.3 %         2.3 %         4.0 %     Securities         17.5 %         17.4 %         17.5 %         18.0 %         18.2 %     Total loans receivable, net of allowance         70.3 %         69.5 %         72.1 %         74.4 %         72.5 %     Premises and equipment, net         1.6 %         1.7 %         1.7 %         1.9 %         2.1 %     Bank owned life insurance         1.8 %         1.8 %         1.7 %         1.7 %         1.6 %     Other assets         2.7 %         3.1 %         2.7 %         1.7 %         1.6 %                                                                       Total assets         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %                                                                       Total deposits         77.4 %         75.0 %         75.5 %         75.0 %         75.3 %     FHLB advances         8.0 %         9.2 %         9.6 %         11.4 %         10.7 %     Other borrowings         3.2 %         5.1 %         4.6 %         4.5 %         4.9 %     Senior subordinated notes         1.1 %         1.1 %         1.2 %         0.0 %         0.0 %     Junior subordinated debentures         1.2 %         1.2 %         1.3 %         1.4 %         1.4 %     Other liabilities         1.0 %         0.9 %         0.8 %         0.7 %         0.8 %     Stockholders’ equity         8.1 %         7.5 %         7.0 %         7.0 %         6.9 %                                                                       Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %         100.0 %   2011 compared to 2010   Total assets increased $1,774, or less than 1%, to $622,867 at December 31, 2011 compared to $621,093 at December 31, 2010. While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged, disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased $5,221, or 5%. Total net loans receivable increased $5,756, or 1%, to $437,557 at December 31, 2011. Offsetting this increase in assets was a $4,154 decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets. Asset growth during 2012 is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt in current economic conditions.   Core deposits increased $14,872 during 2011 from a $17,366 increase in year-end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Increased 2011 deposits were used to repay $11,820 of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year-end. Wholesale borrowings, including brokered and national deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale repurchase agreements increased $425 during 2011 and were $138,190 at December 31, 2011 compared to $137,765 at December 31, 2010. Wholesale funding to total assets was 22.2% at December 31, 2011 and 2010.   2010 compared to 2009   Total assets were $621,093 at December 31, 2010 compared to $606,854 at December 31, 2009, an increase of $14,239, or 2.3%. The majority of the increase was reflected in increased cash and cash equivalents, up $13,994, or 53% during 2010. Commercial related loans declined $9,128 (2.7%) as locally owned small and medium sized business credit demand declined and we continued to work out of existing problem credits. Offsetting the decline in loan balances were increased investment securities and purchased certificates of deposit, which increased $4,678, or 4.4%, and an increase in residential mortgage lending, up $4,506, or 4.4%.       21     Table of Contents      Core deposits increased $16,186, or 4.9% during 2010, although increases in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of $25,512 (13.6%) offset a $7,819 decline (7.0%) in local certificates of deposit. The combination of low customer loan demand and unusually high local competitor certificate of deposit pricing lessoned our demand for local certificate of deposit funding and contributed to the decline in balances. At December 31, 2010, money market funding included $7,167 from a new account relationship obtained during the year from a related party. In addition to the increase in local deposits, overnight repurchase agreement funding from local customers (reflected as other borrowings) increased $10,101, or 128%, during 2010 from acquisition of a new account relationship totaling $8,585 at December 31, 2010. These two large commercial relationships totaling $15,752 at December 31, 2010 were seasonal and declined significantly during 2011.   Increased local deposits were used to repay wholesale deposits and FHLB advances during 2010, which declined $11,089, or 8.2%. All wholesale funding, including brokered deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale other borrowings declined $18,089, or 11.6%, to $137,765 during 2010 compared to $155,854 at December 31, 2009. Wholesale funding to total assets was 22.2% and 25.7% at December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   Net Interest Income   Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them. Interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income. Additionally, net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies. Net interest income is our most significant item of revenue generated by operations.   Table 4 presents changes in the mix of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three years ending December 31, 2011. In general, net interest income earned on loans funded by savings and demand deposits is greater than that earned on securities funded by time deposits. Therefore, a balance sheet that contains a growing allocation of loans funded by a growing allocation of savings and demand deposits would normally provide greater net interest income than a growing allocation of securities funded by a growing allocation of time deposits.   Table 4: Mix of Average Interest Earning Assets and Average Interest Bearing Liabilities       Year ending December 31,

Compared to 2010, loan yield declined from 5.77% to 5.55% (22 basis points) while the tax adjusted investment security yield declined from 4.51% to 3.87% (64 basis points). Continued low overall interest rate levels and very low investment security reinvestment rates caused yield on earning assets to decline as did the cost of paying liabilities, which declined from 2.12% to 1.77% (35 basis points). The market rate decline experienced in the national economy during the 2008-2009 recession continues, and loans, securities, and funding continue to reprice lower to current rate levels. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $8,086 during 2011 compared to $10,506 during 2010. Based on the average loan yield during 2011, the decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2011 increased net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately 8 basis points.   Average earning assets grew $4,007, or 0.7% during 2011, driven by a $6,297 increase in taxable securities, primarily mortgage related investment securities. Average interest bearing liabilities decreased $4,891, or 1.0% during 2011. The primary funding source that decreased was time deposits, declining $13,287, or 7.2%. The changes made to the Rewards Checking account structure and removal of the product from our retail deposit lineup were effective late in 2011, which allowed average product balances to continue to increase during 2011. Average Rewards Checking balances were $48,674 during 2011 compared to $43,264 in 2010, an increase of $5,410, or 12.5%. Average Rewards Checking balances had increased $11,651, or 36.9% during 2010 after growing $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009. Since the account changes, product balances have declined slightly and were $47,578 at December 31, 2011.       24     Table of Contents      We have increased net interest margin since 2009 by inserting interest rate floors in commercial-related loans and retail residential home equity lines of credit to avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin from a sustained low interest rate environment and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market. The coupon rate on approximately 22% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately 139 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate. At December 31, 2011, approximately 82% of our $122 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and, of those loans with floors, virtually 100% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate, approximately 76% of principal have “in the money” loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. If current interest rate levels were assumed to remain the same, the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin would be approximately $1,387 and .24%, respectively, based on those existing loan floors and average total earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2011. During a period of rising short-term interest rates, we expect average funding costs (which are not currently subject to contractual caps on the interest rate) to rise while the yield on loans with interest rate floors would remain the same until those loans’ adjustable rate index caused coupon rates to exceed the loan rate floor. The speed in which short-term interest rates increase is expected to have a significant impact on net interest income from loans with interest rate floors. Quickly rising short-term rates would allow adjustable rate loans with floors to reprice to rates higher than the existing floor more quickly, impacting net interest income less adversely than if short-term rates rose slowly or deliberately.   Because a future increase in short-term funding rates could cause a mismatch between floating rate loan yields and short-term funding costs due to existing interest rate floors, such positions are modeled and reviewed as part of our asset-liability management strategy each quarter. Current interest rate simulations based on more extreme rate scenarios such as short-term rates up 500 basis points combined with a flattening of the yield curve during a 12 month period could reduce net interest income by 4.9% to 8.4% ($577 to $958 after tax impacts) per year during the first three years of the rate increase. We seek to minimize this interest rate risk exposure in part by maintaining the fixed rate period of wholesale funding typically longer than the average term for local deposit funding. Wholesale funding is approximately 22% of total assets and carried an approximately 28 month fixed rate term as of December 31, 2011.   Reinvestment yields for investment security cash flows remain very low and our securities portfolio yield is expected to continue to decline throughout 2012 as cash flows are reinvested in this low rate environment. In addition, loan yields are expected to decline slightly due to competitive pressures as banks seek to increase loan originations while quality credit demand remains weak. These declines in earning asset rates are expected to be only partially offset by further declines in certificate of deposit funding costs and nonmaturity deposit costs with 2012 net interest margin anticipated to continue in a range of 3.45% to 3.55% during 2012.   During 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act repealed the prohibition on paying interest on commercial checking accounts. We currently provide an earnings credit against account fees in lieu of an interest payment and do not expect costs to increase because of this change in the short term. Despite the law change, we do not sell or promote an interest bearing commercial checking account at this time. However, the change could have greater long-term implications as competitor banks begin to use premium interest rate levels on commercial deposits in attempts to raise deposits in coming years.   Also during 2011, President Obama’s administration announced changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), a program first initiated in March 2009. The original program was intended to allow homeowners to refinance their mortgages if they were current on payments and owed between 80% and 105% the value of their homes. Because a limited number of borrowers took advantage of the plan, HARP has now been expanded to allow current borrowers to refinance their mortgage no matter how far the mortgage exceeds the home value. This change could impact the speed of prepayments experienced by investors such as us who hold mortgage related securities backed by borrowers who could benefit from program participation. New or unexpected prepayment on mortgage related securities can impair unamortized purchase premiums paid to obtain high coupon investments in the existing low interest rate environment. At December 31, 2011, we held only three mortgage related securities with high loan coupons expected to be impacted by the HARP program changes. Each of the securities carries an investment coupon of 5.50% and is backed by 30 year fixed rate mortgages issued between 2005 to 2008. Fair value of these securities was $4,340 (approximately 7% of our total mortgage related security portfolio) with an amortized cost of $4,012 and yielding 5.52% at December 31, 2011. Because the securities were held at an aggregate unamortized purchase discount of $5, accelerated purchase premium amortization for accelerated repayments do to the HARP program is not a concern. However, any prepayments on these or other mortgage related securities would be subject to reinvestment at much lower rates, lowering future net interest income, or reducing unrealized gains on securities currently held.   2010 compared to 2009   Cost of funding continued to decline much faster than loan yields during 2010 as loan yields were supported by placement of interest rate floors on floating rate loans. Tax adjusted net interest income increased 11.8% during 2010 with net interest margin increasing to 3.51% from 3.25% in 2009. The coupon rate on approximately 23% of gross loans at December 31, 2010 was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately 150 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate.       25     Table of Contents      Impacts during and following the close of a national recession and government actions to support the economy, including actions by the Federal Reserve, reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads remained high for borrower risk across the banking industry. During 2010, loan yields were stable at 5.77% compared to 5.76% during 2009, while the cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing deposits) declined .47% to 1.53% from 2.00% during 2009. This .48% improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from 3.25% to 3.51% during 2010, an increase of .26%. Tempering the increase in loan to deposit spreads was a decline in yields on securities and other earnings assets of .71% to 3.93% while non-deposit liability funding (including Senior Subordinated Note and junior subordinated debenture funding) declined just .16% to 3.64%. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $10,506 during 2010 compared to $12,190 during 2009. Based on the average loan yield during 2010, the decrease in nonaccrual loans increased net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately 11 basis points.   Average earning assets grew $20,493, or 3.7% during 2010, driven by an increase in overnight interest bearing funds of $7,912, or (138%) and an increase in average loans of $8,029, or 1.8%. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $19,929, or 4.2% during 2010. The primary source of increased average local funding was in our Rewards Checking product, which increased $11,651, or 36.9% during 2010 after growing $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009.   Tax adjusted net interest income increased $2,103, or 11.8% to $19,911 during 2010 compared to $17,808 in 2009. An increase in average earning assets (changes in volume) contributed $480 of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed $1,623 of the increase.   As in 2011, during 2010, loan yields were supported by interest rate floors that increase net interest margin. At December 31, 2010, approximately 94% of our $111 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and, of those loans with floors, approximately 98% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate, approximately 76% of principal had “in the money” loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. If those prior year rates were assumed to remain the same, the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately $1,537 and .27%, respectively, based on those existing loan floors and total earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2010.   2009 compared to 2008   Cost of funding declined much faster than loan yields during 2009 in part due to systematic insertion of loan interest rate floors upon renewal during the year. Tax adjusted net interest income increased nearly 17% during 2009 with net interest margin increasing to 3.25% from 2.98% in 2008. The coupon rate on approximately 24% of gross loans at December 31, 2009 was supported by an average interest rate floor 150 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate.   During 2009, falling short-term interest rates caused by a national recession and government actions to support the economy, including actions by the Federal Reserve, reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads increased for borrower risk across the banking industry. During 2009, loan yields declined .46% to 5.76% while the cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing deposits) declined .86% to 2.00%. This .40% improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from 2.98% to 3.25% during 2009, an increase of ..27%. Tempering the increase in loan to deposit spreads was a decline in yields on securities and other earnings assets of .52% to 4.64% while non-deposit liability funding (including Senior Subordinated Note and junior subordinated debenture funding) declined just .30% to 3.80%. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $12,190 during 2009 compared to $6,810 during 2008. Based on the average loan yield during 2009, the increase in nonaccrual loans lowered net interest margin by approximately 6 basis points during 2009 compared to 2008.   Average earning assets grew $35,121, or 6.9% during 2009, driven by an increase in average loans of $29,836, or 7.4%. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $28,474, or 6.3% with the remaining source of average funding coming from a 8.1% increase in noninterest bearing deposits ($4,105) and increased stockholders’ equity of $3,960. The primary source of increased average local funding was in our Rewards Checking product, which increased $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009.   Tax adjusted net interest income increased $2,555, or 16.8% to $17,808 during 2009 compared to $15,253 in 2008. An increase in average earning assets (changes in volume) contributed $1,164 of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed $1,391 of the increase.   As short term interest rates continued to fall during 2009, yields on adjustable rate loans tied to the prime and 30 day LIBOR rates had the potential to reprice at very low yields. To avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market, we began to systematically insert interest rate floors on commercial related adjustable rate loans and residential mortgage home equity lines of credit upon renewal. At December 31, 2009, approximately 85% of our $129 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors, approximately 97% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. The weighted average amount in which actual loan yields were supported by the “in the money” loan rate floor was approximately 150 basis points on $106 million of adjustable rate loans at December 31, 2009. The annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately $1,588 and .28%, respectively based on these existing loan floors and total average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2009 if interest rates were assumed to remain the same.       26     Table of Contents      Net interest income during 2009 benefited from incremental investment income from a leveraged security purchase completed late in 2007. In the transaction, we purchased approximately $15,000 in mortgage backed securities funded by $13,500 of a mix of floating rate and fixed rate structured repurchase agreement funding. The initial spread on the transaction was 1.39% at closing. During 2009, an increase in credit spreads on mortgage related products combined with falling short-term rates worked together to increase the transaction spread to an average of 2.97% during 2009 compared to an average spread of 2.24% during 2008. This transaction added approximately $99 in additional net interest income during 2009 compared to 2008 and approximately $401 of total gross leveraged investment net interest income during 2009. Details on the structure of the related purchase agreements can be found in Item 8, Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The funding source for this leverage security transaction reset from a short-term floating rate to a long-term fixed rate late in 2009, reducing the current transaction spread to less than 1.00%. The decline in transaction spread reduced 2010 net interest income from this arrangement by approximately $266 compared to 2009. By December 31, 2011, spread on the transaction had declined to .12% and was not a significant contributor to net interest income during 2011. As investment security yields continue to fall while the related funding source remains fixed, we expect the transaction to produce a small amount of negative spread (or loss) to net interest income during 2012 and likely through 2014 when $8,000 of the funding matures.   Interest Rate Sensitivity   We incur market risk primarily from interest-rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We actively monitor and manage our interest-rate risk exposure. The measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments (such as loans and deposits) is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on- and off-balance sheet transactions are aggregated, and the resulting net positions are identified. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in Item 8, Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Our primary objective in managing interest-rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital, while adjusting the asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. We rely primarily on our asset-liability structure reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to control interest-rate risk. In general, longer-term earning assets are funded by shorter-term funding sources allowing us to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates. However, a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings, to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. We do not engage in significant trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes.   Our overall strategy is to coordinate the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of interest rate movement on the net interest margin. Table 8 represents our earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2011. It is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment, particularly during periods when the interest yield curve is flattening or steepening. The following repricing methodologies should be noted:   1. Public or government fund MMDA and NOW accounts are considered fully repriced within 60 days. Higher yielding retail and non-governmental money market and NOW deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within 90 days. Rewards Checking NOW accounts and lower rate money market deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within one year. Other NOW and savings accounts are considered “core” deposits as they are generally insensitive to interest rate changes. These core deposits are generally considered to reprice beyond five years. 2. Nonaccrual loans are considered to reprice beyond 5 years.     3.                        Assets and liabilities with contractual calls or prepayment options are repriced according to the likelihood of the call or prepayment being exercised in the current interest rate environment.     4.                        Measurements taking into account the impact of rising or falling interest rates are based on a parallel yield curve change that is fully implemented within a 12-month time horizon.     5.                        Bank owned life insurance is considered to reprice beyond 5 years.   Table 8 reflects an asset sensitive (“positive”) gap position during the next year, with a cumulative one-year gap ratio as of December 31, 2011 of 107.9% compared to a negative gap (liability sensitive position) of 93.0% at December 31, 2010. In general, a current positive gap position would be favorable in a rising rate environment, but unfavorable in a falling rate environment. However, net interest income is impacted not only by the timing of product repricing, but the extent of the change in pricing which could be severely limited from local competitive pressures. This factor can result in changes to net interest income from changing interest rates different than expected from review of the gap table.       27     Table of Contents      Table 8: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis         December 31, 2011       (dollars in thousands)       0-90 Days         91-180 days         181-365 days         1-2 yrs.         Beyond. 2-5 yrs.         Beyond 5 yrs.         Total             Earning assets:                                                                                         Loans       $ 163,494         $ 47,429         $ 61,699         $ 76,321         $ 70,597         $ 25,997         $ 445,537       Securities         8,020           6,488           12,518           17,430           33,967           30,254           108,677       FHLB stock                                                                     3,250           3,250       CSV bank-owned life insurance                                                                     11,406           11,406       Other earning assets         23,400           500           –           248           1,736           –           25,884                                                                                                 Total       $ 194,914         $ 54,417         $ 74,217         $ 93,999         $ 106,300         $ 70,907         $ 594,754       Cumulative rate sensitive assets       $ 194,914         $ 249,331         $ 323,548         $ 417,547         $ 523,847         $ 594,754                                                                                                             Interest-bearing liabilities                                                                                         Interest-bearing deposits       $ 167,866         $ 18,132         $ 96,743         $ 35,142         $ 46,710         $ 41,618         $ 406,211       FHLB advances         11,000                                   8,075           31,049                       50,124       Other borrowings         6,191                                               8,000           5,500           19,691       Senior subordinated notes                                                                     7,000           7,000       Junior subordinated debentures                                                                     7,732           7,732                                                                                                 Total       $ 185,057         $ 18,132         $ 96,743         $ 43,217         $ 85,759         $ 61,850         $ 490,758       Cumulative interest sensitive liabilities       $ 185,057         $ 203,189         $ 299,932         $ 343,149         $ 428,908         $ 490,758                                                                                                             Interest sensitivity gap for                                                                                         the individual period       $ 9,857         $ 36,285         $ (22,526 )       $ 50,782         $ 20,541         $ 9,057                   Ratio of rate sensitive assets to                                                                                         rate sensitive liabilities for                                                                                         the individual period         105.3%           300.1%           76.7%           217.5%           124.0%           114.6%                                                                                                             Cumulative interest sensitivity gap       $ 9,857         $ 46,142         $ 23,616         $ 74,398         $ 94,939         $ 103,996                   Cumulative ratio of rate sensitive                                                                                         assets to rate sensitive liabilities         105.3%           122.7%           107.9%           121.7%           122.1%           121.2%                 We use financial modeling policies and techniques to measure interest rate risk. These policies are intended to limit exposure of earnings at risk. A formal liquidity contingency plan exists that directs management to the least expensive liquidity sources to fund sudden and unanticipated liquidity needs (Refer to the section labeled “LIQUIDITY” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We also use various policy measures to assess interest rate risk as described below.       28     Table of Contents      Interest Rate Risk Limits   We balance the need for liquidity with the opportunity for increased net interest income available from longer term loans held for investment and securities. To measure the impact on net interest income from interest rate changes, we model interest rate simulations on a quarterly basis. Our policy is that projected net interest income over the next 12 months will not be reduced by more than 15% given a change in interest rates of up to 200 basis points. Table 9 presents the projected impact to net interest income by certain rate change scenarios and the change to the one year cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities.   Table 9: Net Interest Margin Rate Simulation Impacts       As of December 31:       2011       2010       2009           Cumulative 1 year gap ratio                                         Base         108%           93%           88%       Up 200         104%           89%           84%       Down 100         111%           95%           92%                                                 Change in Net Interest Income – Year 1                                         Up 200 during the year         -2.1%           -2.5%           -3.3%       Down 100 during the year         -0.7%           -1.0%           -1.1%                                                 Change in Net Interest Income – Year 2                                         No rate change (base case)         -5.1%           -2.4%           0.1%       Following up 200 in year 1         -3.5%           -2.6%           -2.0%       Following down 100 in year 1         -9.8%           -7.5%           -5.9%         Note:     Simulations after December 2007 reflect net interest income changes from a down 100 basis point scenario, rather than a down 200 basis point scenario.   To assess whether interest rate sensitivity beyond one year helps mitigate or exacerbate the short-term rate sensitive position, a quarterly measure of core funding utilization is made. Core funding is defined as liabilities with a maturity in excess of 60 months and capital. Core deposits including DDA, NOW, and non-maturity savings accounts (except high yield NOW such as Rewards Checking deposits and money market accounts) are also considered core long-term funding sources. The core funding utilization ratio is defined as assets that reprice in excess of 60 months divided by core funding. Our target for the core funding utilization ratio is to remain at 80% or below given the same 200 basis point changes in rates that apply to the guidelines for interest rate risk limits exposure described previously. Our core funding utilization ratio after a projected 200 basis point increase in rates was 61.9% at December 31, 2011 compared to 76.7% and 81.6% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This ratio declined during 2011 due to a decrease in the average life within the investment security portfolio combined with an increase in the core deposit categories noted above.   The high level of the core funding utilization ratio at December 31, 2009 in the up 200 basis point scenario was due to projected extension in principal payments on residential mortgage loans held in the loan portfolio as well as residential mortgage related securities held in the investment securities portfolio. At December 31, 2009, in the up 200 basis point scenario, securities and loan principal to reprice in 5 years or longer increased approximately $16,635, or 25%. Over 80% of this change was due to changes related to residential mortgage loans or related securities. Although above the internal target of 80%, this level was considered manageable and monitored quarterly.       29     Table of Contents      At December 31, 2011, internal interest rate simulations that project interest rate changes that maintain the current shape of the yield curve (often referred to as “parallel yield curve shifts”) estimated relatively small projected changes to future years’ net interest income, even in more extreme periods of interest rate changes such as up 400 basis points during a 24 month period. However, if interest rates were to increase more quickly than anticipated and if the yield curve flattened at the same time, such as in a “flat up 500 basis point” change occurring during 2012, net interest income would decline during the first three years of the simulation in amounts ranging from 4.9% to 8.4% of the base simulation’s net interest income ($953 to $1,581 per year). When the yield curve flattens, repriced short-term funding cost, such as for terms of one year or less increases, while maturing fixed rate balloon loans, such as with terms from 3 to 5 years, increase much less. During flattening periods, assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but to a much different extent. Current net interest income sensitivity to a rising and flattening yield curve is similar to that seen at December 31, 2010 when similar “flat up 500 basis point” projections indicated net interest income would decline during the first two years of the simulation in amounts ranging from 4.9% to 5.0% of the base simulation’s net interest income.   While not expected during 2012, in future years interest rates could rise to levels significantly greater than today and exhibit a flattening interest yield curve. To minimize such interest rate risk, we typically extend the average fixed term of our wholesale funding portfolio of brokered certificates and FHLB advances. Extending such funding may decrease net interest income in the current environment (since funding with short-term interest rate costs would be less expensive), but does provide additional protection against rising interest rates in future years. At December 31, 2011, the average fixed rate term of the wholesale funding portfolio was 28 months. During 2012, we expect the average fixed term of the wholesale portfolio to decline in anticipation of an extended period of low interest rates and to better manage net interest income in an extended low rate environment. Wholesale funding was 22.2% of total assets at December 31, 2011.   Although the flat up 500 basis points simulation is projected to negatively impact net interest income, we have significant risk to a prolonged period of low or falling rates in the already low rate environment. In this situation, loan and security yields continue to decline while funding costs reach effective lows, reducing net interest margin, particularly if average credit spreads were to decline to levels seen prior to 2008 (pre recessionary levels). In the down 100 basis point scenario in the December 31, 2011 income simulations, net interest income is projected to decline as follows compared to the current “base rate” scenario:               $         %                                 Year 1 -       $ 141           0.7%       Year 2 -       $ 903           4.9%       Year 3 -       $ 1,379           7.4%       Year 4 -       $ 1,954           10.0%       Year 5 -       $ 2,286           11.7%     Despite recent rate volatility and periodic continued declines in market interest rates, management does not consider such a protracted low interest rate environment to be likely, but continues to monitor its asset-liability position in light of this potential long-term risk to net interest income levels.   Investment Securities Portfolio   The investment securities portfolio is intended to provide us with adequate liquidity, flexible asset/liability management, and a source of stable income. During 2009, all securities were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses were excluded from earnings, but reported as other comprehensive income in a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income tax. However, during 2010, the municipal security portfolio and nonrated trust preferred securities and senior subordinated notes with fair value totaling $54,130 (including unrealized gain of $2,552) were transferred from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. These securities were transferred to better reflect our intent and practice to hold these long-term securities until maturity and to minimize potential volatility to stockholders’ equity from future changes in unrealized gains and losses in a rising interest rate environment. As securities held to maturity, changes in unrealized gains and losses after the transfer date are not reflected in stockholders’ equity and these securities are recorded at amortized cost. The original unrealized gain of $2,552 on the security transfer date is being amortized against the new cost basis (equal to transfer date fair value) over the remaining life of the securities. Table 10 presents the fair value of securities held by us at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009.       30     Table of Contents      Table 10: Investment Securities Distribution – At Fair Value               As of December 31               2011         2010         2009               Fair         % of         Fair         % of         Fair         % of       Securities available for sale :       Value         Portfolio         Value         Portfolio         Value         Portfolio                                                                         U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies       $ 518           0.47%         $ 1,041           0.97%         $ 10,227           9.63%                                                                                     Obligations of states and political subdivisions         –           0.00%           –           0.00%           47,178           44.44%                                                                                     U.S. agency residential mortgage backed securities         19,816           18.00%           17,690           16.54%           23,868           22.48%                                                                                     U.S. agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations         38,573           35.02%           35,511           33.21%           22,346           21.04%                                                                                     Privately issued residential collateralized mortgage obligations         429           0.39%           980           0.92%           936           0.88%                                                                                     Nonrated trust preferred securities         –           0.00%           –           0.00%           1,562           1.47%                                                                                     Other equity securities         47           0.04%           51           0.05%           68           0.06%                                                                                     Total securities available for sale         59,383           53.92%           55,273           51.69%           106,185           100.00%                                                                                     Securities held to maturity :                                                                                                                                                           Obligations of states and political subdivisions         49,010           44.50%           49,806           46.58%           –           0.00%                                                                                     Nonrated trust preferred securities         1,332           1.21%           1,456           1.36%           –           0.00%                                                                                     Nonrated senior subordinated notes         409           0.37%           400           0.37%           –           0.00%                                                                                     Total securities held to maturity         50,751           46.08%           51,662           48.31%           –           0.00%                                                                                     Total investment securities       $ 110,134           100.00%         $ 106,935           100.00%         $ 106,185           100.00%     At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any single issuer where the aggregate carrying value of such securities exceeded 10% of stockholders’ equity, except for combined senior debentures and guaranteed mortgage related securities issued by U.S. Agencies such as the FHLB, FNMA, or FHLMC.   Securities with an approximate fair value of $56,659, and $60,111, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were pledged primarily to secure public deposits, customer overnight repurchase agreements (classified as other borrowings), and for other purposes required by law, representing approximately 53% and 57% of securities eligible for pledging at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Securities considered ineligible for pledging include privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations, other equity securities, and nonrated trust preferred and senior subordinated note securities.   As a member of the FHLB system, we are required to hold stock in the FHLB based on borrowings advanced to Peoples State Bank. This stock has a purchase cost and par value of $100 per share. We held $3,250 of FHLB Chicago stock at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The current capital stock level supports FHLB total advances of $65,000. The stock is recorded at cost which approximates market value. Transfer of the stock is substantially restricted. The FHLB may pay dividends in both cash and additional shares of stock. An annualized dividend rate of .10% was paid on FHLB stock during 2011. No dividends were paid during 2010 or 2009. The FHLB of Chicago currently operates under a capital management plan required by their regulatory oversight body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We cannot predict if the cash dividends will continue or if they may be increased. Due to a heightened level of regulatory oversight and in recognition of stock transfer restrictions, our investment in FHLB stock has been evaluated for impairment, with no other than temporary impairment write-down deemed necessary at December 31, 2011.   Table 11 categorizes securities by scheduled maturity date as of December 31, 2011 and does not take into account the existence of optional calls held by the security issuer. Therefore, actual funds flow from maturing securities may be different than presented below. Maturity of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, some of which call for scheduled monthly payments of principal and interest, are categorized by average principal life of the security. Yields by security type and maturity are based on amortized security cost.       31     Table of Contents      Table 11: Investment Securities Maturities and Rates                           After one but             After five but                           Within one year         within five years         within ten years         After ten years       As of December 31, 2011       Amount         Yield            Amount         Yield            Amount         Yield                  Amount         Yield                                                                                    Securities available for sale :                                                                                                                                                                                                           U.

Investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions declined $796, or 1.6% as maturity proceeds were reinvested in mortgage related securities. Upon purchase, the mortgage related securities carried average principal lives generally ranging from 3 to 5 years with well defined repayment cash flows.   During 2011, we purchased no additional Qualified School Construction Bonds such as we did in 2010 and 2009 and held $4,803 of such bonds at December 31, 2011 compared to $4,995 and $3,872 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These bonds do not carry a stated interest rate, but instead pay a federal income tax credit as a fixed percentage of the bond principal that we use to offset our federal taxable income. At December 31, 2011, this portfolio carried a tax adjusted yield of 4.97% and an average stated maturity of approximately 5.9 years and were considered a general obligation of the issuing local government authority. Virtually all of our municipal investment holdings are considered general obligations of the local taxing authority. At December 31, 2011, approximately 77% of all municipal obligations in the portfolio were from issuers in Wisconsin compared to 79% of all municipal obligations at December 31, 2010.   The privately issued residential mortgage obligations held of $429 and $980 at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as shown in Table 10 are rated AAA and represent fully amortizing mortgage loan pools originated during 2004 or prior years which are considered to carry very low risk of loss. These whole loan pools include loans which could be classified as conforming loans with FNMA or FHLMC except that loan principal was greater than the jumbo loan limit of these agencies at the time the loans were originated. Principal repayment of these securities is not guaranteed against loss by any government agency but is wholly dependent on borrower repayments and strength of the home values in the collateral pool.       32     Table of Contents      The non-rated trust preferred securities were issued by three banks headquartered in Wisconsin with management teams known to us including Johnson Financial Group, Inc., River Valley Bancorporation, Inc., and Northern Bankshares, Inc. The non-rated senior subordinated notes were issued by McFarland State Bank, a subsidiary of Northern Bankshares, Inc. After a significant loss during 2010, Johnson Financial Group, Inc. elected to defer payments of interest on their trust preferred security issue, causing us to classify the $750 par value investment as a nonperforming asset. During 2011, the owners of Johnson Financial Group entered into an agreement with regulators to recapitalize the bank, significantly improving its capital position and stability. We cannot predict when Johnson Financial Group may resume payment of interest on this issue and we intend to classify it as nonperforming until interest payments begin. We regularly review the financial performance of Johnson Financial Group and the other banks associated with our trust preferred and senior subordinated note investments. None of the securities were considered other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011.   The fair value of the securities available for sale as a percentage of book value based on original amortized cost trended higher during 2011 as falling market reinvestment rates improved the value of fixed rate securities already held in our portfolio. At December 31, 2011, fair value was 103.0% of amortized cost compared to 100.3% of amortized cost at December 31, 2010. As noted previously, during 2010, municipal securities were reclassified from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. Fair value of municipal securities at the transfer date is reflected in stockholders’ equity as comprehensive income and will be amortized against the new cost basis over the remaining life of the securities. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial States for additional information. The net unrealized gain on securities transferred to securities held to maturity and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity was $1,124, net of taxes of $760 at December 31, 2011. The net unrealized gain on securities available for sale, recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity, was $1,162, net of deferred taxes of $727 at December 31, 2011. Unrealized securities gains and losses, net of income tax effects, do not impact the level of regulatory capital under current banking regulations. We believe investment security yields have a stabilizing effect on net interest margin during periods of interest rate swings and expect to hold existing securities until maturity or repayment unless such funds are needed for liquidity due to unexpected loan growth or depositor withdrawals or if the sale is beneficial to our interest rate risk and return profile. Periods of rising interest rates would likely decrease the unrealized fair value of fixed rate securities in our portfolio.   During 2012, we expect to reinvest maturing securities cash flow into securities with average lives generally between 3 to 4 years and to minimize growth in our municipal securities portfolio whose securities have fixed terms generally from 10 to 11 years. These actions are designed to reduce our interest rate and market risks inherent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at this time. In addition, agency securities are considered to be a higher quality collateral asset for pledging purposes than municipal securities, which increases contingency liquidity sources.   2010 compared to 2009   During 2010, fair value of investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions as shown in Table 10 increased $2,628, or 5.6% while agency mortgage related securities increased $6,987, or 15.1%, and agency debentures declined $9,186, or 90%. Agency debentures matured during a period of very low reinvestment rates for similar debentures so funds were invested in higher yielding U.S. Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”).   The fair value of the investment portfolio as a percentage of book value based on original amortized cost trended higher for most of 2010 as falling market reinvestment rates improved the value of fixed rate securities already held in our portfolio. However, transfer of the municipal security portfolio during 2010 from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity increased the amortized cost basis to the fair value of the securities at the time of transfer. Following the transfer, longer-term interest rates increased, which caused fair value of fixed rate municipal securities to fall below their new book value. At December 31, 2010, fair value was 100.3% of amortized cost compared to 102.8% of amortized cost at December 31, 2009. The net unrealized gain on securities transferred to securities held to maturity and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity was $1,471, net of taxes of $929 at December 31, 2010. The net unrealized gain on securities available for sale, recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity, was $1,071, net of deferred taxes of $669 at December 31, 2010.       33     Table of

are originated for a broad range of business purposes including non-owner occupied office rental space, multi-family rental units, owner occupied manufacturing facilities, and owner occupied retail sales space. Approximately 75% of fully disbursed commercial real estate loans (excluding construction and development loans) are considered to be owner occupied at December 31, 2011. We have little lending activity for agricultural purposes. Our management is involved in the communities we serve and believes it has a strong understanding of the local economy, its business leaders, and trends in successful business development. Based on this knowledge, we offer flexible terms and efficient approvals which have allowed us to grow and manage this type of lending.   As part of the asset/liability and interest rate sensitivity management strategy, we generally do not retain long-term 20 to 30 year fixed rate mortgages in our own portfolio. Therefore, it is our practice to sell the majority of long-term fixed rate mortgage loan originations to secondary market agencies in exchange for a fee. From time to time, we retain second mortgage loans, on certain high value homes requiring total financing above the conforming secondary market limit, after selling the first mortgage into the secondary market. In addition, some local borrowers require mortgage financing that does not fit one of the secondary market programs, cannot qualify for secondary market financing because they cannot obtain a qualifying appraisal due to lack of comparable sales, or the borrower prefers us to hold the loan in our own portfolio. First and second mortgage loans on the balance sheet generally carry fixed rate balloon payment terms of five years or less.   Consumer and individual loans include short-term personal loans, automobile and recreational vehicle installment loans, and credit card loans. We experience extensive competition from local credit unions offering low rates on installment loans and therefore direct resources toward more profitable lending categories such as residential fixed rate mortgages and commercial real estate lending. However, due to income tax advantages, many customers borrow on a tax deductible home equity line of credit for many purposes formerly funded by a consumer installment loan. Therefore, we consider consumer purpose lending to be represented by the combination of consumer and individual lending and residential mortgage home equity.       34     Table of Contents      2011 compared to 2010   Loans held for investment continue to consist primarily of commercial related loans, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 74% of total loans at December 31, 2011 compared to 75% of total loans at December 31, 2010. All construction and land development loans, including commercial and 1-4 family residential construction loan commitments were approximately 7.4% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2011 compared to 7.9% at December 31, 2010. Loans in this classification are primarily short-term loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate, such as multi-family or other commercial development projects. We retain permanent financing on these projects following completion of construction in a majority of cases. Construction loans also include residential new construction single family homes originated in the normal course of business which are typically sold in the secondary market upon completion of construction.   Loan growth opportunities were limited during calendar 2011 and 2010 and gross loans outstanding (including loans held for sale) at December 31, 2011 increased $5,340, or 1.2%. Gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2010 decreased $5,047, or 1.1%, compared to December 31, 2009. Our prospect customer and loan pipeline report increased modestly over that seen during 2010 but primarily from companies with larger credit needs as larger companies appear to be recovering from a slow economy faster than smaller companies. In addition, pipeline growth has been with relationships estimated to have a 40% to 80% likelihood of closing. Until small business credit quality and demand improve, our loan growth is likely to be volatile as we seek to originate larger credits with relatively healthy companies while competing against many banks seeking to organically grow their loan portfolios.   Significantly, our organic local loan growth was difficult during 2011 as economic conditions have lowered borrower demand for debt in our markets. In addition, large regional banks in our markets, including BMO Harris Bank, who during 2011 acquired M&I Bank’s market leading share position, are aggressively pursuing loan growth with our market’s highest credit quality customers with low loan coupon rates and spreads. These actions could keep loan growth levels low during 2012 or contribute to a decline in our net interest margin as we compete within our markets. Based on availability of local funding during 2012, we may seek out participation purchased loans originated by other banks on properties in Wisconsin with an emphasis on credit quality as the primary purchase criteria if local loan growth is not available to meet budgeted asset growth. Total participation loans purchased and held in our loan portfolio totaled $12,196, or 2.7% of gross loans presented in Table 12 at December 31, 2011 compared to $13,305, or 3.0% of gross loans at December 31, 2010.   2010 compared to 2009   Total loans receivable presented in Table 12 decreased $3,738, or ..8%, to $445,124 during 2010 after increasing 2.7% to $448,862 during 2009. Local commercial customer demand for increased credit for expansion decreased significantly during the second half of 2009 and remained low during all of 2010 with commercial related loans declining in 3 out of 4 quarters. When combined with real estate construction and development loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased $5,070 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The decline in commercial real estate loans was due in part to work out of a problem construction and development loan with a loan balance of $3,446 at December 31, 2009 that was resolved in 2010 with net amounts transferred to foreclosed assets of $1,700. The transfer represented 56% of all loan principal transferred to foreclosed assets during 2010. This decline was offset by a $4,796, or 7.2%, increase in closed end residential mortgage loans. Although we normally sell originations of long-term fixed rate residential mortgages, late in 2010 we retained $10,589 of such loan originations with an average fully amortizing term of 215 months and a fixed rate of 4.53% using investment security cash flows due to very low security reinvestment rates. All construction and land development loans, including commercial and 1-4 family residential construction loan commitments were approximately 7.9% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2010 compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2009.   Loans Receivable Maturities   Table 13 categorizes loan principal by scheduled maturity at December 31, 2011, and does not take into account any prepayment options held by the borrower. The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic conditions. At December 31, 2011, no concentrations existed in our portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans except for a geographical concentration of borrowers and collateral located in Marathon County, Wisconsin in which we have the majority of our branches and operations representing approximately 73% of the loan portfolio.       35     Table of Contents      Table 13: Loan Maturity Distribution and Interest Rate Sensitivity               Loan Maturity               One year         Over one year         Over       As of December 31, 2011:       or less         to five years         five years                                                 Commercial, industrial, municipal, and agricultural       $ 66,988         $ 47,590         $ 12,614       Commercial real estate mortgage         57,701           112,354           14,305       Real estate construction         22,005           10,311           1,181       Residential real estate mortgage         16,266           24,860           36,988       Residential real estate mortgage held for sale         39                               Residential real estate home equity         23           22,264           906       Consumer and individual         1,301           2,247           184                                                 Totals       $ 164,323         $ 219,626         $ 66,178                                                 Fixed rate                   $ 164,531         $ 53,059       Variable rate                     55,095           13,119                                                 Totals                   $ 219,626         $ 66,178     Credit Quality   Provision for Loan Losses   The loan portfolio is our primary asset subject to credit risk. Our process for monitoring credit risk includes quarterly analysis of loan quality, delinquencies, nonperforming assets, and potential problem loans. An allowance for loan losses is maintained for incurred losses inherent but yet unidentified in the loan portfolio due to past conditions as well as for specifically identified problem loans. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio based on current economic conditions. Provisions to the allowance for loan losses are recorded as a reduction to income. Actual loan loss charge offs are charged against the allowance for loan losses.   The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed via ongoing credit quality review and grading of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, trends in past due and nonperforming loans, existing economic conditions, loss exposure by loan category, and estimated future losses on specifically identified problem loans. We have an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality. Accordingly, the amount charged to expense is based on our multi-factor evaluation of the loan portfolio. It is our policy that when available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, including impaired loans, are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the allowance. In addition to coverage from the allowance for loan losses, nonperforming loans are secured by various collateral including business, real estate and consumer collateral. Loans charged off are subject to ongoing review and specific efforts are taken to maximize recovery of principal, accrued interest, and related expenses.   Nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1%, to $17,883 (2.87% of total assets) at December 31, 2011, from $16,389 (2.64% of total assets) at December 31, 2010 as restructured loans to troubled borrowers that performed according to restructured terms increased by $3,837, or 161.0%. Although these restructured loans are accruing interest, they are still classified as nonperforming loans. Approximately 52% of total nonperforming assets are made up of nine individual nonperforming assets greater than $500 at December 31, 2011. Approximately 46% of total nonperforming assets were made up of seven individual nonperforming assets greater than $500 at December 31, 2010. As shown Table 31, total nonperforming assets as a percentage of tangible common equity including the allowance for loan losses (the “Texas Ratio”) were 31.32% at December 31, 2011 compared to 30.61% at December 31, 2010 and 35.04% at December 31, 2009. For the purpose of this measurement, tangible common equity is equal to total common stockholders’ equity less mortgage servicing right assets.   Provision for estimated loan losses declined to $1,390 in 2011 from $1,795 in 2010. The provision for loan losses decreased during 2011 compared to 2010 due to a reduction in seriously delinquent nonaccrual loans of $1,065, or 11.8%, during 2011 and identification of fewer new problem loans as the local economy and borrower credit stabilized. However, loss on foreclosed assets increased $348, or 41.0% to $1,197 during 2011 compared to $849 during 2010 from a larger amount of partial write-downs to foreclosed properties. Partial write-downs were $992 during 2011 and $405 during 2010. Total credit costs as represented by the provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed property was largely unchanged and was $2,587 during 2011 and $2,644 during 2010.       36     Table of Contents      Nonperforming loans are reviewed to determine exposure for potential loss within each loan category. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed based on credit quality and other pertinent loan portfolio information. The adequacy of the allowance and the provision for loan losses is consistent with the composition of the loan portfolio and recent internal credit quality assessments. We maintain our headquarters and one branch location in the City of Wausau, Wisconsin, and maintain the majority of our deposits (including five of our eight locations), and loan customers in Marathon County, Wisconsin. During 2011, the Marathon County, Wisconsin unemployment rate declined from 7.1% in December 2010 to 6.5% in December 2011. Late in 2011, two large local manufacturing employers located in Marathon County announced local factory closures which were reported to eliminate approximately 1,000 jobs, a significant amount in our local economy. It is possible the unemployment rate will increase and remain elevated during 2012. The annualized level of loan loss provision during 2012 is expected to be similar to the level recorded during 2011, although loss on foreclosed assets is expected to decline during 2012 compared to the prior year. Future provisions will be impacted by the actual amount of impaired and other problem loans identified by internal procedures or regulatory agencies. In addition, fair value of existing foreclosed assets continue to be reviewed in light of recent local market data and may be subject to a further write-down of value during 2012.   Loans are placed on a nonaccrual status when they become contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. All interest accrued but not collected for loans (including applicable impaired loans) that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income. Nonaccrual loans and restructured loans maintained on accrual status remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated. In general, uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated when the borrower has displayed a history of regular loan payments using a market interest rate that is expected to continue as if a typical performing loan. Some borrowers continue to make loan payments while maintained on non-accrual status. We apply all payments received on nonaccrual loans to principal until the loan is returned to accrual status or repaid.   Table 14: Loan Loss Experience       Years ended December 31       2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                                                               Average balance of loans for period       $ 443,709         $ 443,293         $ 435,264         $ 405,428         $ 384,265                                                                         Allowance for loan losses at beginning of year       $ 7,960         $ 7,611         $ 5,521         $ 4,850         $ 4,478                                                                         Loans charged off:                                                                                                                                   Commercial, industrial, municipal, and agricultural         867           454           479           156           60       Commercial real estate mortgage         236           448           951           –           –       Residential real estate mortgage         367           462           123           53           19       Consumer and individual         117           101           83           75           55                                                                         Total charge-offs         1,587           1,465           1,636           284           134                                                                         Recoveries on loans previously charged-off:                                                                                                                                   Commercial, industrial, municipal, and agricultural         166           7           19           63           17       Commercial real estate mortgage         6           –           –           –           –       Residential real estate mortgage         –           8           –           –           –       Consumer and individual         6           4           7           7           9                                                                         Total recoveries         178           19           26           70           26                                                                         Net loans charged-off         1,409           1,446           1,610           214           108       Provision for loan losses         1,390           1,795           3,700           885           480                                                                         Allowance for loan losses at end of year       $ 7,941         $ 7,960         $ 7,611         $ 5,521         $ 4,850                                                                         Ratio of net charge-offs during the year to average loans         0.32%           0.33%           0.37%           0.05%           0.03%                                                                         Ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans receivable at end of year         1.78%           1.81%           1.71%           1.28%           1.24%     The allocation of the year-end allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years based on our estimate of loss exposure by category of loans is shown in Table 15. Our allocation methodology focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, the geographic and industry mix of the loan portfolio, and historical losses by category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio. Management allocates the allowance for loan losses by pools of risk and by loan type. We combine estimates of the allowance needed for loans analyzed individually and loans analyzed on a pool basis. The determination of allocated reserves for larger commercial loans involves a review of individual higher-risk transactions, focused on loan grading, and assessment of projected cash flows and possible resolutions of problem credits. While we use available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and future impacts to specific borrowers.       37     Table of Contents      The majority of gross loan charge-offs during 2011 were related to six borrowers totaling $1,143, or 72% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge off of $700 related to a line of credit to a building supply company. The majority of gross loan charge-offs during 2010 were related to five borrowers totaling $1,064, or 73% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge-off of $448 related to a nonowner multi-use, multi-tenant commercial real estate development, the majority of which was sold during 2011. During 2009, the majority of gross loan charge-offs were related to four borrowers totaling $1,187, or 73% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge off of $737 related to an out of state syndicated loan participation development project which remains in foreclosed assets at December 31, 2011 and is outlined in Table 17.   Table 15: Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses       As of December 31,       2011       2010       2009       2008       2007                       % of                 % of                 % of                 % of                 % of             Dollar         principal       Dollar         principal       Dollar         principal       Dollar         principal       Dollar         principal                                                                                                                                   Commercial, industrial,                                                                                                                                municipal, and agricultural       $ 1,743           1.44 %       $ 2,736           2.14 %       $ 2,602           1.98 %       $ 2,889           2.20 %       $ 2,670           2.44 %     Commercial real estate mortgage         2,290           1.17 %         3,304           1.72 %         2,641           1.36 %         1,876           0.98 %         1,802           0.96 %     Residential real estate mortgage         627           0.56 %         211           0.19 %         191           0.19 %         97           0.10 %         103           0.10 %     Consumer and individual         103           2.81 %         213           5.42 %         189           4.34 %         112           2.46 %         55           1.27 %     Impaired loans         3,178           18.46 %         1,496           13.10 %         1,988           15.03 %         547           5.65 %         220           10.19 %                                                                                                                                   Totals       $ 7,941           1.78 %       $ 7,960           1.81 %       $ 7,611           1.71 %       $ 5,521           1.28 %       $ 4,850           1.24 %   During the March 2011 quarter, we underwent a comprehensive update of our process to categorize impaired loans, estimate the related allowance for loan losses on impaired loans, and estimate inherent losses on other portfolio loans not considered to be impaired. This review did not significantly increase or decrease the amount of allowance for loan losses required on the bank wide portfolio compared to our previous method of estimating loss allowances. However, our new method did allocate a greater amount of the reserve to impaired loans. During 2011, we streamlined internal criteria to classify a loan as impaired which now includes all nonaccrual loans, all restructured loans (whether performing or not), and other loans with the potential to become nonaccrual or restructured in the next year. Prior to 2011, impaired loans were generally defined to include larger commercial purpose loans only and did not include all nonaccrual or restructured loans. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the loan loss activity by loan category during 2011 and 2010.   Nonperforming loans are defined as loans 90 days or more past due but still accruing, nonaccrual loans, including those defined as impaired under current accounting standards, and restructured loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed, and future payments received are applied in full to reduce remaining loan principal. No income is accrued or recorded on future payments until the loan is returned to accrual status. Upon return to accrual status, the interest portion of past payments that were applied to reduce nonaccrual principal is taken back into income. The interest that would have been reported in 2011 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $647 in comparison to $124 actually recorded in income. The interest that would have been reported in 2010 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $784 in comparison to $430 actually recorded in income. The interest that would have been reported in 2009 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $851 in comparison to $557 actually recorded in income.   Troubled debt restructured loans (“TDR”) are also included in nonperforming loans. Restructured loans involve the granting of concessions to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, or capitalization of unpaid real estate taxes or unpaid interest that the lender would not normally grant. The majority of restructured loans represent conversion of amortizing commercial purpose loans to interest only loans for a temporary period to increase the problem borrower’s cash flow. The remaining restructured loans granted a lower interest rate to borrowers for a temporary period to increase borrower operating cash flow. Such loans are subject to management review and ongoing monitoring and are made in cases where the borrower’s delinquency is considered short-term from circumstances the borrower is believed able to overcome or which would reduce our estimated total credit loss on the relationship. Nonaccrual loans (including nonaccrual restructured loans) remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated. Therefore, some borrowers continue to make substantially all required payments while maintained on non-accrual status.       38     Table of Contents      Substantially all of our residential mortgage loans originated for and held in our loan portfolio were based on conventional and long standing underwriting criteria and are secured by first mortgages on homes in our local markets. We were not an originator of higher risk loans such as option ARM products, high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, interest only loans, subprime loans, or loans with initial teaser rates that can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. At December 31, 2011, approximately $2.3 million of loans receivable were 1 – 4 family home equity or junior lien mortgage loans in which the maximum commitment amount of the line of credit plus existing senior liens is greater than 100% of the underlying real estate value, or were a loan in a 3 rd mortgage position or lower, compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. Such loans were not originated as part of a program to add higher yielding loans to our portfolio but were loans made on a case by case basis and individually underwritten with the borrower customized to their need. We do not maintain a formal residential mortgage modification program for delinquent residential mortgage borrowers. At December, 31, 2011, the inherent credit loss allocation on non-problem open ended home equity lines of credit was .78% of loan principal compared to .50% during 2010 and 2009 to reflect the risk of future credit losses on such junior lien mortgages from current economic conditions.   Nonperforming assets include: (1) loans that are either contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, on a nonaccrual status, or the terms of which have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal (restructured loans), (2) investment securities in default as to principal or interest, and (3) foreclosed assets. Table 16 presents nonperforming loans and assets by category for the five years ended December 31.   Table 16: Nonperforming Loans and Foreclosed Assets       As of December 31,       2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                                                                         Nonaccrual loans (excluding restructured loans)       $ 5,893         $ 7,127         $ 11,829         $ 10,590         $ 3,144       Nonaccrual restructured loans         2,081           1,912           1,469           –           –       Restructured loans not on nonaccrual         6,220           2,383           –           748           653       Accruing loans past due 90 days or more         –           –           –           –           –                                                                         Total nonperforming loans         14,194           11,422           13,298           11,338           3,797       Nonaccrual trust preferred investment security         750           –           –           –           –       Foreclosed assets         2,939           4,967           3,776           521           653                                                                         Total nonperforming assets       $ 17,883         $ 16,389         $ 17,074         $ 11,859         $ 4,450       Impaired loans considered to be performing       $ 3,026         $ 6,398         $ 3,774         $ 2,504         $ 1,522                                                                         Total nonperforming loans as a percent of gross loans         3.19%           2.60%           2.99%           2.64%           0.97%       Total nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets         2.87%           2.64%           2.81%           2.08%           0.83%     2011 compared to 2010   The provision for loan losses was $1,390 in 2011 compared to $1,795 in 2010. Non-performing loans relative to total loans increased significantly from 2.60% at December 31, 2010 to 3.19% at December 31, 2011 due to addition of $3,837 of restructured loans which continue to perform on their restructured terms. However, foreclosed assets decreased from $4,967 at December 31, 2010 to $2,939 at December 31, 2011. Including the trust preferred investment security issued by Johnson Financial Group, total nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1% to $17,883 at December 31, 2011. After 2010, when the decline in local economic conditions stabilized, the local economy remained slow to recover, which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2011, the unemployment rate was 6.6% in Wisconsin and 6.5% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from 7.1% at December 31, 2010) compared to a rate of 8.5% for the United States.   During 2012, we expect restructured loans to increase as we work with problem borrowers to minimize the level of potential future charge-offs and maximize cumulative total principal repayment. In addition, regulatory pressures and a change in generally accepted accounting principles regarding identification of restructured loans are likely to increase loans disclosed as troubled debt restructurings. Although some restructured loans may continue on accrual status, the restructured designation would still increase total nonperforming loans and could increase the provision for loan losses.       39     Table of Contents      Approximately 52% of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties greater than $500 at December 31, 2011:   Table 17: Largest Nonperforming Assets at December 31, 2011 ($000s)       Collateral Description     Asset Type       Gross Principal         Specific Reserves                                            Northern Wisconsin hotel     Accrual TDR       $ 1,767         $ –            Cranberry producing agricultural real estate     Accrual TDR         1,578           –            Vacation home/recreational properties (three)     Foreclosed         1,280           n/a            Multi-family rental apartment units and vacant land     Accrual TDR         1,240           302            Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate and equipment     Accrual TDR         764           47            Johnson Financial Group (WI) Capital Trust III debentures     Nonaccrual         750           –            Owner occupied multi use, multi-tenant real estate     Accrual TDR         688           195            Owner occupied restaurant real estate and business assets     Nonaccrual         675           150            Out of area condo land development - loan participation     Foreclosed         587           n/a                                                 Total listed nonperforming assets             $ 9,329         $ 694            Total bank wide nonperforming assets             $ 17,883         $ 2,659            Listed assets as a percent of total nonperforming assets               52%           26%            Table 18: Largest Performing, but Impaired Loans at December 31, 2011 ($000s)       Collateral Description     Asset Type       Gross Principal         Specific Reserves                                                 Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate and equipment     Impaired       $ 790         $ 98            Owner occupied manufacturer real estate & equipment     Impaired         615           –                                                 Total listed performing, but impaired loans             $ 1,405         $ 98            Total performing, but impaired loans             $ 3,026         $ 519            Listed assets as a % of total performing, but impaired loans               46%           19%          During 2011, we restructured commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a hotel in Northern Wisconsin to change borrower payments from amortizing to interest only due to a decline in revenue. This loan relationship is included in Table 17 as $1,767 of gross principal. This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan is classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan. A collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December 31, 2011. We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout 2012.   During 2011, we restructured commercial mortgage loans collateralized by cranberry producing agricultural real estate to change from amortizing payments to interest only payments as the property owner sought to sell the operation or partner with new investors. This loan relationship is included in Table 17 as $1,578 of gross principal. This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan was classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan. A collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December 31, 2011. We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout 2012 unless the borrower sells the operation to a new investor.   During 2009, $3.3 million of foreclosed properties originally related to a $5.8 million land development loan were sold at auction at a loss of $452 excluding a previously expensed $125 auction marketing fee. The remaining $2,477 foreclosed asset was further written down $427 to an estimated fair value of $2,050 at December 31, 2009 for total valuation losses on the property of $1,004 during 2009 when including the marketing fee. During 2010, one of the four remaining individual properties was sold and the entire $283 sale proceeds were applied to reduce cost basis of the remaining properties. During 2011, the remaining properties were further written down an additional $487 due to declining real estate values for this type of vacation property. As shown in Table 17, three properties remain with cost basis of $1,280 at December 31, 2011. During 2011, the northern Wisconsin area where these properties are located experienced few vacation property transactions in excess of $1 million, such as would be appropriate for this foreclosed property. We actively market these remaining properties for sale but cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset.       40     Table of Contents      During 2010, we entered into a restructuring agreement on a $1,177 commercial real estate loan with a local developer and owner of multi-family apartment complexes to extend the amortization period on existing debt to increase cash flow available to the developer to meet real estate tax and other obligations. At December 31, 2011, this $1,240 debt as reflected in Table 17 is maintained on accrual status and no reduction in stated interest rate was made in the modification. We obtained a new collateral appraisal during 2011 which indicated the property value has declined. We estimated various scenarios for future borrower payments on this loan including a liquidation scenario in the current environment. Based on our analysis, a $302 allowance for loan losses was maintained against the loan at December 31, 2011.   During 2010, we restructured the loan terms on $754 of loan principal to lower the interest rate on existing debt with a borrower in the cabinetry contracting industry to increase cash flow during a large decline in customer sales. During 2011, the borrower sold the business to a competitor but retained a mortgage on the production facility which is leased to the new owner and gave a purchase option within three years to the new business owner. We expect the new owner to exercise the purchase option near the end of the three year term. The remaining $764 principal is maintained on accrual status and reflected in Table 17 at December 31, 2011. Based on projected cash flows to be received from our borrower from rental payments received by the new business owner, we maintained a $47 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 compared to a loan loss reserve of $75 in the prior year.   During 2011, we were informed by Johnson Financial Capital Trust of its intent to defer payment of interest on its 7% trust preferred capital debentures. Johnson Financial Group is the holding company for Johnson Bank, headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin and is the second largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin. Our investment in the $750 debentures was placed on nonaccrual status and no interest income was recorded during 2011. Later in 2011, the family ownership of Johnson Financial Group agreed with regulators to recapitalize the bank with approximately $235 million in equity capital. The new capital is expected to be fully contributed to the bank by 2012. Our internal evaluation has determined this investment is not other than temporarily impaired and no charge against net income for impairment has been recorded.   During 2011, we restructured an owner occupied commercial real estate loan with a local insurance agent. The building was constructed during 2008 and included additional space to rent to unrelated service businesses. The debt was restructured to extend the amortization period to support declining borrower cash flow as portions of the building remained vacant. The restructured loan continues to be maintained on accrual status. The $688 loan is reflected in Table 17 at December 31, 2011. We obtained a new collateral appraisal during 2011 which identified that the value of the property had declined. We estimated various cash payment scenarios from the borrower including cash flow in connection with a liquidation and sale under current market conditions. We maintained an allowance for loan losses against this loan of $195 at December 31, 2011.   During 2009, we restructured a $613 loan secured by an owner occupied restaurant to increase borrower cash flow and allow the business to continue operating. During 2010, the borrower’s residential mortgage loan was also classified as a nonperforming loan which increased net nonperforming principal by $93 to $706 at December 31, 2010. The loan is maintained on nonaccrual status and all payments received are used to lower the principal balance. During 2011, $31 of payments were received reducing the balance to $675 as shown in Table 17. A new collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and various cash flow scenarios were analyzed including liquidation of the collateral under current market conditions. At December 31, 2011 an allowance for loan losses of $150 was maintained against this credit compared to the $100 allowance maintained at December 31, 2010. We cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this problem loan.   During 2007, we entered into a syndicated construction loan agreement sold by Bankers’ Bank Madison, Wisconsin, for construction of vacation condos and an adjacent water park near Hollister, Missouri. The construction loan was intended to be repaid by the proceeds from a municipal tax incremental financing debt issue by the local municipality. When the credit markets for such financing dried up, the project was unable to continue and land development work ceased. The loan participants obtained the property in foreclosure during 2009. The original fair value estimate of the completed project was approximately $24 million. At the time of foreclosure, we valued our asset using a new liquidation value appraisal based on our approximately 7% ownership of the project resulting in a cost basis of $792 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. During 2011, a new appraisal identified a further decline in value and the loan was written down an additional $205 to its new cost basis of $587 as reflected in Table 17. At this time, we are unable to determine the final resolution of this property and further write-downs of value could be required during 2012 when updated appraisals are obtained.   2010 compared to 2009   The provision for loan losses was $1,795 in 2010 compared to $3,700 in 2009. Non-performing loans relative to total loans declined slightly and was 2.60% at December 31, 2010 compared to 2.99% at December 31, 2009. However, foreclosed assets increased from $3,776 at December 31, 2009 to $4,967 at December 31, 2010. Therefore, total nonperforming assets were $16,389, or 2.64% of total assets at December 31, 2010 compared to $17,074, or 2.81% of total assets at December 31, 2009. During 2010, the decline in local economic conditions stabilized but at low levels, which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2010, year-end, the unemployment rate was 7.0% in Wisconsin and 7.1% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from 8.9% at December 31, 2009) compared to a rate of 9.1% for the United States. The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked 29 th out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties for December 2010 (from lowest to highest unemployment rate).       41     Table of Contents      A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year-end. If impaired loans and related specific reserves (if any) were disregarded, the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans would have been 1.47% at December 31, 2010 and 1.30% at December 31, 2009 as we continued to increase inherent losses on the loan portfolio during 2010 reflecting the uncertainty of ongoing customer credit stress and high delinquency ratios.   Approximately 46% of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties greater than $500 at December 31, 2010:   Table 19: Largest Nonperforming Assets at December 31, 2010 ($000s)       Collateral Description      Asset Type       Gross Principal         Specific Reserves       Vacation home/recreational properties (aggregate of three)      Foreclosed       $ 1,767           n/a         Nonowner occupied multi use, multi-tenant real estate      Foreclosed         1,450           n/a         Multi-family rental apartment units and vacant land      TDR         1,177           –       Building supply inventory and accounts receivable      Nonaccrual         823           700       Out of area condo land development – participation      Foreclosed         792           n/a         Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate      TDR         754           75       Owner occupied restaurant and business assets      Nonaccrual         706           100                                           Total listed assets             $ 7,469         $ 875       Total bank wide nonperforming assets             $ 16,389         $ 1,989       Listed assets as a % of total nonperforming assets               46%           44%     Activity for non-performing assets held at December 31, 2010 as shown in Table 19 that are still held at December 31, 2011 and reflected in Table 17 was described previously. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2010 that are no longer included as part of our largest nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 are described below.   At December 31, 2009, we held a $3,446 loan secured by commercial real estate collateral located in Weston, Wisconsin, and marketable equity investments shown in Table 19 on which we completed foreclosure during 2010 and charged off $448 of loan principal. Later in 2010, we recorded a further partial write-down of $250 for a remaining cost of $1,450 as shown in Table 19. During 2011, we sold the building and a significant portion of the vacant and recorded a loss on the sale of $183. The remaining foreclosed property consists of vacant land with a $342 balance at December 31, 2011. We actively market this property for sale but at this time are unable to determine the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset. We do not expect further significant losses on resolution of the foreclosed asset.   During 2009, our borrower in the building supplies industry ceased payments on a $961 loan secured by construction inventory and accounts receivable in part due to uncollected large accounts receivable due to a dispute between our customer and the account payer. During 2010, we collected $138 in payments which were applied to principal which totaled $823 as shown in Table 19. Due to poor collateral position, we reserved $700 against the loan relationship at December 31, 2009 which was maintained at December 31, 2010. After receipt of final payment, during 2011, we charged-off the remaining $700 of the balance due, representing our largest loan charge-off during 2011.   2009 compared to 2008   The provision for loan losses was $3,700 in 2009 compared to $885 in 2008. Non-performing loans relative to total loans continued to increase and was 2.99% at December 31, 2009 compared to 2.64% at December 31, 2008. In addition, foreclosed assets increased from $521 at December 31, 2008 to $3,776 at December 31, 2009. Therefore, total nonperforming assets were $17,074, or 2.81% of total assets at December 31, 2009 compared to $11,859, or 2.08% of total assets at December 31, 2008. Non-performing loans increased primarily from declining general and local economic conditions which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2009, the unemployment rate was 8.3% in Wisconsin and 8.9% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers) compared to a rate of 9.7% for the United States. The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked 39 th out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties for December 2009.   A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year-end. If impaired loans and related specific reserves (if any) were disregarded, the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans would have been 1.30% at December 31, 2009 and 1.18% at December 31, 2008 as we increased inherent losses on the loan portfolio during 2009 reflecting the ongoing stress and rising delinquency ratios.       42     Table of Contents      Noninterest Income   Table 20 presents a common size income statement showing the changing mix of income and expense relative to traditional loan and deposit product net interest income (before tax adjustment) for the five years ending December 31, 2011.

During 2011, service fees declined $154, or 8.6%, due to lower customer usage of our courtesy overdraft program (and related overdraft fees) in response to new regulation concerning this product effective in August 2010. The new regulation requires that certain payments by consumers who did not opt into the bank’s overdraft program are not paid by the bank, reducing overdraft fee income. In addition, the new regulation and negative publicity concerning banks and their overdraft protection programs continue to lower customer usage of the product and we could see further service fee income declines during 2012 related to overdrafts. In addition, mortgage banking income declined $99, or 6.7% as residential mortgage rates began to settle at historically low levels during 2011. Offsetting these declines was commission income on sale of fixed interest rate swaps to commercial adjustable rate loan customers of $207 during 2011. The swap product was a new product during 2011 and is included in other operating income in Table 21 above. Certain commercial customers with adjustable rate loans with us may choose to enter into an interest rate swap with us to convert their floating rate interest payments to a fixed rate. We simultaneously sell these fixed rate hedge contracts to a correspondent bank in exchange for a fee.       43     Table of Contents      During 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act related to debit card interchange income, often referred to as the “Durbin Amendment.” These new changes cap the amount of debit card interchange income that may be collected by large banks from merchants for processing card activity. While the new rules technically do not apply to us as a smaller bank, the impacts are expected to become uniform for the industry over time as merchants use their new authority and options to process customer card activity across a wider number of providers. While the timing is uncertain, these fully implemented changes could lower our annualized debit card interchange revenue by approximately $234, down approximately 36% from revenue levels prior to the regulatory change. In general, the banking industry has begun to respond to lower debit card fee revenue by reducing customer account reward programs and related costs and increasing account service fees. We continue to investigate the nature and timing of potential future retail checking account changes in response to the expected reduction of debit card income.   Many important sources of noninterest income are impacted by recent and coming federal regulation, including overdraft service fee income and debit card income as noted previously. In addition, the prolonged period of declining residential mortgage rates is gradually lowering the level of mortgage refinanced activity. In addition, we discontinued selling the Rewards Checking NOW product during 2011 which rewarded customers for higher levels of debit card activity. We expect lower usage of debit cards due to this change. Because we expect overdraft income, debit card income, and mortgage income to decline during 2012, we expect total noninterest income to decline during 2012 compared to 2011.   2010 compared to 2009   During 2010, total noninterest income declined $213, or 3.8%, to $5,363 compared to $5,576 during 2009. However, excluding nonrecurring net gains (losses) on security sales, 2010 noninterest income increased $328, or 6.5% compared to 2009. Although 2010 mortgage banking income declined $378 as more borrowers refinanced their residential mortgages when rates fell significantly during 2009 compared to 2010, several other types of income experienced significant increases. For example, service charge income increased $338, or 23.3%, from higher overdraft fee income, and investment and insurance sales commissions increased $221, or 57.0%, from higher gross sales activity. Prior to new regulation which lowered overdraft activity, the bank had rolled out an updated courtesy overdraft product early in 2010 which increased year over year overdraft income and service fee income despite the regulatory change. Lastly, interchange income from credit and debit cards increased $115, or 18.7% during 2010 compared to 2009.   Many of the increases in 2010 were in areas expected to be impacted by continued regulatory changes including overdraft fees and card interchange income. Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in 2010 due to increased Rewards Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account. We discontinued selling the Rewards Checking account to new customers in 2011 which is likely to decrease debit card interchange income in future years.   New consumer banking regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve concerning customer overdraft programs went into effect during August 2010. The new regulation prevents banks from assessing an overdraft fee related to a transaction conducted at a point of sale such as those using a debit card unless the consumer has specifically “opted into” the program. From the effective date of the regulation to the end of 2010, we experienced an approximately 18% reduction in gross overdraft activity compared to activity prior to the regulatory change.   Prior to 2009, bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance. However, limited further investments in this asset class are expected.   2009 compared to 2008   Noninterest income excluding gain (loss) on sale of securities increased 21% during 2009 from a record year of mortgage banking income totaling $1,850 (up 78% over 2008) as customers refinanced their long-term fixed rate residential mortgages. Residential loan principal sold to the secondary market during 2009 was approximately 2.3 times and 3.9 times the levels seen during 2008 and 2007, respectively. This activity was promoted by historically low long-term mortgage rates.   During 2009, total noninterest income was $5,576 compared to $3,184 during 2008, an increase of $2,392, or 75.1%. The most significant components of the change include a gain on sale of securities of $521 as well as increased 2009 mortgage banking income of $810 in addition to a loss on FNMA stock of $991 incurred during 2008. Excluding these special items, noninterest income would have increased $70, or 2.2% during 2009.   United States Treasury programs and open market mortgage related asset purchases by the Federal Reserve during 2009 dramatically lowered long-term residential mortgage rates, contributing to a wave of mortgage refinancing during 2009. Our mortgage banking income was $1,850 during 2009 compared to $1,040, an increase of $810. During 2009, our mortgage loan portfolio serviced for others increased 28% reaching $237.8 million at December 31, 2009. The components of mortgage banking income may be found in Item 8, Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in 2009 due to increased Reward Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account. Prior to 2009, bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance during 2009 and 2008.       44     Table of Contents      Noninterest Expense   Table 22 outlines the components of noninterest expenses for the three years ending December 31, 2011.   Table 22: Noninterest Expense       Years Ended December 31,       2011       2010       2009                       % of net                 % of net                 % of net                       margin &                 margin &                 margin &             Amount         other income*       Amount         other income*       Amount         other income*                                                                       Wages, except incentive compensation       $ 6,121           23.88 %       $ 6,207           24.56 %       $ 5,991           25.62 %     Health and dental insurance         852           3.32 %         941           3.72 %         882           3.77 %     Incentive compensation         589           2.30 %         610           2.41 %         378           1.62 %     Payroll taxes and other employee benefits         587           2.29 %         613           2.44 %         553           2.38 %     Profit sharing and retirement plan expense         470           1.83 %         446           1.76 %         274           1.17 %     Deferred compensation plan expense         136           0.53 %         125           0.49 %         77           0.33 %     Restricted stock plan vesting expense         78           0.30 %         43           0.17 %         25           0.11 %     Deferred loan origination costs         (496 )         -1.93 %         (518 )         -2.05 %         (708 )         -3.03 %                                                                                   Total salaries and employee benefits         8,337           32.52 %         8,467           33.50 %         7,452           31.88 %     Occupancy expense         1,702           6.64 %         1,863           7.37 %         1,822           7.79 %     Data processing other office operations         1,382           5.39 %         1,174           4.65 %         957           4.09 %     Loss on foreclosed assets         1,197           4.67 %         849           3.36 %         1,130           4.83 %     FDIC insurance expense         505           1.97 %         782           3.09 %         986           4.22 %     Directors fees and benefits         367           1.43 %         295           1.17 %         262           1.12 %     Legal and professional expenses         333           1.30 %         339           1.34 %         322           1.38 %     Advertising and promotion         291           1.14 %         355           1.40 %         355           1.52 %     Debit card and deposit losses         136           0.53 %         356           1.41 %         166           0.50 %     Other expenses         1,528           5.96 %         1,445           5.72 %         1,543           6.59 %                                                                                   Total noninterest expense       $ 15,778           61.55 %       $ 15,925           63.01 %       $ 14,829           63.42 %   * Net interest income (net margin) is calculated on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34%.   2011 compared to 2010   During 2011, total noninterest expenses were $15,778 compared to $15,925 during 2010, a decrease of $147, or 0.9%. However, operating expenses before foreclosure costs would have declined $495, or 3.3%, during 2011 compared to 2010 with $277 of the decline coming from lower FDIC insurance premiums and $220 of the decline coming from lower debit card and deposit losses. Dodd-Frank legislation effective during 2011 changed the method in which deposit insurance premiums are calculated. Premium levels are now assessed based on net assets after deducting Tier 1 regulatory capital rather than being assessed based on the level of deposits held. The effect of this change was to transfer a greater portion of total industry deposit insurance premiums to the nation’s largest banks as they typically maintain a lower percentage of deposits to assets compared to smaller banks like us. Debit card losses were higher in 2010 due to sustaining a net $110 loss from a concentrated fraud involving certain of our customer accounts. Salaries and employee benefits declined $130, or 1.5%, from $8,467 in 2010 to $8,337 in 2011 due primarily to an $89 decrease (9.5%) in health and dental insurance expense.   During 2011, data processing expenses increased $208, or 17.7%, compared to 2010 due to outsourced data processing costs associated with the new computer system placed in service during June 2010. However, occupancy and facilities expense declined $161 during 2011 in part from lower computer equipment depreciation expense previously incurred with the prior in-house computer system and categorized as occupancy expenses. During 2012, data processing expense is expected to increase at a rate similar to that seen during 2011 as we experience a full year of regular contract charges. Following the June 2010 conversion, we had enjoyed discounted monthly vendor charges to help offset conversion related costs incurred during the first year of using the new system.   During 2012, wages and benefits are expected to increase minimally with average base pay increases of 2.5% granted January 1, 2012 compared to average base pay increases of 2.7% granted for 2011. Although less than seen during 2010, employee incentive costs remained historically high as 2011 net income exceeded the target. Depending on net income growth during 2012, such increased incentives may not recur, potentially reducing employee costs. For example, if our 2012 net income was the same as in 2011, incentive costs could decline 25% to 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. Health and dental insurance costs are incurred under a self insured plan subject to a maximum stop loss. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We expect 2012 health and dental costs to increase closer to levels experienced during 2010.       45     Table of Contents      Foreclosed asset expense is expected to decline during 2012 due to lower levels of partial charge-offs of foreclosed properties as local real estate values stabilize. Partial charge-offs of foreclosed property from value declines were $992 in 2011 compared to $405 during 2010 and $477 during 2009. In addition we expect to experience lower 2012 holding costs as the remaining investment in foreclosed assets remains near current levels, which is significantly lower than seen during 2010.   Changes to FDIC insurance assessment methods as part of the Dodd-Frank legislation are expected to keep our FDIC insurance premium expense during 2012 similar to 2011 levels. However, the FDIC insurance rate is subject to the level of industry wide bank closures and related deposit insurance fund losses which is unpredictable and could be greater in future years than seen during 2011. Although not expected during 2012, accelerated or unexpected levels of bank failures within the industry could cause the FDIC to increase premiums or collect special assessments to make up insurance fund shortfalls. Lastly, our specific insurance rating is dictated in large part by results of our annual regulatory exam. While not expected, negative regulatory exam results could significantly increase our FDIC insurance premium expense.   During 2012, advertising and promotional expense is expected to increase modestly as we roll out a new retail checking account line up. Taken together, noninterest expense excluding foreclosed property write-downs and gains and losses on sales of properties is expected to increase by an inflationary amount during 2012.   2010 compared to 2009   During 2010, total noninterest expenses were $15,925 compared to $14,829 in 2009, an increase of $1,096, or 7.4%. The majority of the increase was in the form of higher salaries and employee benefits which increased $1,015, or 13.6% during 2010. Base wages represented $215 of the increase, growing 3.6% over 2009 with increased overtime pay representing $59 of the increase related to the June 2010 quarter core processing system conversion. Excluding overtime pay, base wages increased 2.6% during 2010. Other factors included fewer deferred direct loan origination costs of $190, increased health and dental insurance plan expense of $59, and higher year-end incentive and discretionary profit sharing plan allocations of $404, up 62%, based on exceeding 2010 net income targets.   FDIC insurance expense declined $204, or 20.6% during 2010 compared to 2009 due to the prior year including a special FDIC insurance assessment totaling $264. Prior to the special assessment, 2010 FDIC insurance expense increased $60, or 8.3%. Offsetting the 2010 decline in FDIC expense was an increase in data processing and other office operations expense of $217, or 22.7%, due to a change in core processing computer system during June 2010 from an internally maintained system to an outsourced vendor system. Following the June 2010 conversion date, the system vendor provided a contractual reduction in monthly service fees that expired during 2011. The new system, while increasing data processing costs, provides significant operating efficiencies and capacity for customer and product growth compared to the prior system maintained in house since 1997. The prior in house data processing system recognized a significant portion of the cost as elements of depreciation expense, reflected as occupancy expense, while software maintenance charges were reflected as data processing costs.   During 2010, we incurred a $110 loss related to debit card fraud, net of insurance reimbursements, that resulted from a coordinated external fraud targeting us and our debit card customers. Even excluding this individual loss, debit card losses of $57 were significantly higher than seen during 2009. Along with debit card losses, deposit losses increased from $96 during 2009 to $180 during 2010 as we increased the benefit limit of our courtesy overdraft program. The increased deposit losses on the courtesy overdraft program during 2010 were approximately 22% of the increased 2010 overdraft fee income.   2009 compared to 2008   Noninterest expenses totaled $14,829 during 2009 quarter compared to $12,566 during 2008, an increase of $2,263, or 18.0%. During 2009, loss on foreclosed assets increased $1,124 compared to 2008 to a total of $1,130 from a $1,004 loss on a large land development foreclosure partially sold at auction and $126 in foreclosure costs related to all other properties.   In addition, the FDIC increased regular quarterly insurance premiums and charged a onetime special assessment during 2009 to recapitalize the FDIC insurance fund in light of ongoing and expected bank failures. During 2009, our FDIC insurance expense was $986 compared to $284 during 2008, an increase of $702. During December 2009, we prepaid $2.6 million to the FDIC representing estimated insurance premiums during 2010 through 2012 as required by the FDIC. This prepayment is amortized as FDIC insurance expense based on assessment rates then in effect as measured on a quarterly basis.   Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $608, or 8.9% during 2009 primarily from base wage increases and a slightly larger employee base (together representing $379 of increased expense). Incentive and profit sharing payments related to loan fees, deposit growth, mortgage banking, and return on equity performance to banking peer group increased $163, or 33% during 2009 compared to 2008. An increase in health insurance expense of $54, or 6.5%, during 2009 compared to 2008 made up the remainder of increased salaries and benefits expense.       46     Table of Contents      Income Taxes   The effective tax rate was 31.3% during 2011 compared to 29.5% in 2010 and 22.1% in 2009. The 2011 and 2010 effective rates increased as the percentage of tax-exempt income from securities and bank owned life insurance declined relative to total pre-tax income. Tax-exempt interest on securities and bank-owned life insurance reduced tax expense by $621 in 2011, $666 in 2010, and $697 during 2009. These reductions represented 23.6%, 29.1%, and 51.3% of tax expense at the statutory tax rate during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The reductions have come from higher levels of pretax income during 2011 and 2010 combined with lower tax exempt yields on municipal securities and life insurance as long-term rates declined in the overall market. Refer to Item 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax information. Due to declining average reinvestment rates on tax-exempt municipal securities, we expect the effective tax rate to increase slightly during 2012 compared to 2011.   The 2009 effective tax rate increased over 2008 from a change in State of Wisconsin income tax law to a combined reporting model. This change subjected investment income earned on investment securities held by PSB Investments, Inc., Peoples State Bank’s investment subsidiary, to state income taxes. Previously, income on these investments was not subject to Wisconsin income taxes. This change in taxation method increased our provision for income taxes by $162 during 2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 effective tax rate would have been 18.0% without the state tax regulation change.   Critical Accounting Policies   Allowance for Loan Losses   As noted previously, during the quarter ended March 31, 2011, we changed our methodology to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. The changes were made in response to several regulatory and industry factors including greater transparency in allowance and loss activity by loan segment and class, greater reliance on various external and internal factors to determine contingency reserves on loans not considered to be impaired, and greater reliance on estimates of future cash flows on impaired loans to estimate required allowances with lesser reliance on impaired loan collateral fair value to determine required allowances.   Current accounting standards call for the allowance for loan losses to include both specific losses on identified impaired problem loans and inherent contingent losses on existing loan pools not yet considered problem loans. Determination of the allowance for loan losses at period-end is based primarily on subjective factors and management assessment of risk in the existing portfolio. Actual results, if significantly different from those using estimates at period-end, could have a material impact on the results of operations. For example, losses incurred on loans not previously identified as carrying significant loss potential would increase the provision for loan losses expense equal to the amount of the loan principal charged off. Refer to Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on allocation of the allowance for loan losses between different credit risk categories and for impaired loans as well as our system to review changes in credit risk on individual loans.   Loans receivable, for the purpose of estimating the allowance for loan losses, are separated into 12 loan categories:   Performing loans (5 categories, all of which are assigned inherent loss reserves):   Residential mortgages Home equity lines of credit Consumer and individual loans Commercial real estate loans – credit risk grades 1 (“high quality”) through grade 4 (“acceptable risk”) Commercial and industrial loans – grades 1 through 4 Problem loans assigned inherent loss reserves (4 categories):   Commercial real estate loans – grade 5 (“watch”) and grade 6 (“substandard”) loans Commercial and industrial loans – grade 5 (“watch”) and grade 6 (“substandard”) loans Impaired loans assigned specific reserves (3 categories):   Commercial real estate loans - grade 7 (“impaired”) Commercial and industrial loans – grade 7 (“impaired”) Residential mortgage, consumer, and other personal loans – grade 7 (“impaired”) Commercial purpose loans are subcategorized into the credit risk “grades” based on an internal determination of risk established during credit analysis and updated no less than annually. Determination of risk grades takes into account several factors including collateral, cash flow, borrower’s industry environment, financial statement strength, and other factors. Identified impaired problem loans under current accounting standards are classified into the lowest quality risk grade (grade 7). Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, loans identified as restructurings of troubled debt, and loans accruing interest with elevated risk of default in the near term based on a variety of credit factors.       47     Table of Contents      Inherent loss reserves are assigned as a percentage of estimated loss on principal within each category and are based on the following historical and subjective factors:   Weighted average historical net charge-off of principal by category during the past 12 quarters. Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of external factors including: changes in economic conditions, changes in nature/volume of portfolio, changes in collateral values, changes in regulatory requirements, and changes in peer data. Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of internal factors including: changes in bank policies, changes in underwriting criteria, changes in volume of past due loans, changes in internal local review processes, and management turnover. Inherent loss reserves for loans categories graded 5 (watch) and grade 6 (substandard) are provided additional contingency reserves beyond those described above to reflect the emerging credit risk represented by loans within these categories. These additional contingency reserves are based on the average specific reserves calculated for impaired loans by category at period end. Grade 5 (watch ) loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to 25% of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category. Grade 6 (substandard) loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to 50% of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category.   Specific reserves are calculated on each individual borrower by estimating future cash flows associated with borrower payments and foreclosure value of collateral associated with the loan. Cash flows expected from foreclosure of collateral are discounted for closing costs and based on estimated current collateral and property values. Estimated cash flows are discounted by the loan contract rate to determine the present value of future cash flows. For loans considered to be restructurings of trouble debt, the cash flows are discounted using the loan contract rate in place prior to any loan modifications. Loans considered collateral dependent are assigned reserves based on the net cash value of collateral without consideration of discounted estimated cash flows.   After calculating the estimate of required allowances for loan losses using the steps above, a further subjective analysis of current and projected economic conditions, problem loan trends, and other factors may cause additional unallocated reserves to be recorded to reflect this additional risk of loss before it is recognized by the change in commercial credit risk grades, or the increase in the historical inherent loss percentage assigned to loan categories. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no unallocated loan loss allowances were recorded.   Estimates of inherent losses on non-problem loans are a significant accounting estimate due to the many economic and subjective factors involved in estimating future losses based on existing negative factors associated with unidentified future problem loans currently making payments. Reliance on historical charge off activity and subjective factors related to external and internal factors is expected to increase volatility in allowance for loan losses, which could increase volatility in quarterly net income as conditions change and increase or decrease the existing allowance for loan losses. For example, if the actual inherent losses on the five performing loan categories evaluated using inherent loss estimates as described above were 25% greater than those currently applied to meet reserve needs, the December 31, 2011 allowance for loan losses would have increased $843 (10.6%) and have decreased 2011 net income by approximately $511 after income taxes.   In addition, an unexpected downgrade of loans classified grade 5 (watch) and grade 6 (substandard) to impaired status could significantly increase total allowance for loan losses as those downgraded loans are allocated allowances based on projected cash flow or collateral values on an individualized basis. For example, at December 31, 2011, if all of the loans graded 6 (substandard) and 50% of loan principal graded 5 (watch) were reclassified as impaired loans and experienced the average loss allocation currently reflected in the impaired loan portfolio, the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 would have increased $1,215 (15.3%) and decreased 2011 net income by approximately $736 after income taxes.   Mortgage Servicing Rights   As required by current accounting standards, we record a mortgage servicing right asset (“MSR”) when we continue to service borrower payments and perform maintenance activities in exchange for an annual servicing fee of .25% of average serviced mortgage principal on loans in which the principal has been sold to the FHLB or other secondary market investors. Our initial value of servicing rights is calculated on an individual loan level basis and uses public financial market information for many of the significant estimates. In the period in which the principal is sold to the secondary market investors, we increase the gain on sale of the loan by the value of the initial MSR. If the actual value was less than we recorded, such as if the estimated future servicing period or average serviced principal was less than estimated, the gain recorded on origination of the MSR would be overstated. Recognition of impairment of excess mortgage servicing rights would decrease income, causing our accounting for mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy. For example, if the actual value of initial MSR on 2011 secondary market sales were 25% less than that recorded, gain on sale of loans (a component of mortgage banking income) during 2011 would have declined approximately $105 before income taxes. In addition, if the actual value of the entire December 31, 2011 MSR were 25% less than recorded, net servicing revenue (a component of mortgage banking income) would have declined approximately $301 before income taxes.       48     Table of Contents      We make the following estimates and perform the following procedures when accounting for MSRs:       1.                        Serviced loans are stratified by risk of prepayment criteria. Currently, strata are first based on the year in which the loan was originated, then on term, and then on the range of interest rates within that term.        2.                        We use a discount approach to generate the initial value for the OMSR. The calculation takes the average of the current dealer consensus on prepayment speeds as reported by Andrew Davidson & Company or the prepayment speed implied in the mortgage backed security prices for newly created loans along with other assumptions to generate an estimate of future cash flows. The present value of estimated cash flows equals the fair value of the OMSR. We capitalize the lower of fair value or cost of the OMSR.    Refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for significant fair value and cost estimates other than the estimate of public dealer consensus of prepayment speeds. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would change the initial value recorded for OMSRs and change the gain on sale of mortgage loans recorded in the income statement.       3.                        Amortization of the OMSR is calculated based on actual payment activity on a per loan basis. Because all loans are handled individually, curtailments decrease MSRs as well as regularly scheduled payments. The loan servicing value is amortized on a level yield basis.       4.                        Significant declines in current market mortgage interest rates decrease the fair value of existing MSRs due to the increase in anticipated prepayments above the original assumed speed. Accounting standards require that impairment testing be performed and that MSRs be recorded at the lower of fair value or amortized cost. We perform quarterly impairment testing on our MSRs. Actual prepayment speeds (based on our actual customer activity on a loan level basis) are compared to the assumed prepayment speed on the date of the last quarterly impairment testing (or the origination prepayment speed if a recently originated loan). The fair value assumptions other than prepayment speed are combined with the new estimated prepayment speed to create a new fair value. An impairment allowance is recorded for any shortfall between the new fair value and the original cost after adjusting for past amortization and curtailments.   LIQUIDITY   Because total assets increased just $1,774, or 0.3% during 2011, the $14,872 increase in core deposits (up 4.3%) was used to pay down other borrowings by $11,820 during 2011 while wholesale borrowings increased $425. During 2010, the majority of the $14,239 in asset growth was funded by an increase in retail and local deposits of $16,890 (up 4.4%). During 2009, local deposits increased $18,584 (5.1%) and brokered certificates increased $12,346 (19.0%) to fund net loan growth of $22,355 and repayment $6,841 of FHLB advances.       49     Table of Contents      Wholesale funding includes FHLB advances, brokered and national certificates of deposits, wholesale repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased. These sources of wholesale funding are limited by the wholesale lender’s ability to raise individual depositor funds, our regulatory capital classification, our ability to generate positive earnings performance, our sources of collateral acceptable to the wholesale lender, by our internal policy limitations on aggregate exposure to use of such funds, and in the case of the FHLB, our level of FHLB capital stock relative to our aggregate amount of FHLB advances.

We consider core retail deposits to include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand and savings deposits, money market demand deposits, and retail time deposits less than $100. Core retail deposits represented 57.9% and 55.7% of total assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition to core certificates of deposit, funding from local certificates with balances greater than $100 made up 7.4% and 8.4% of total assets at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Despite being held by local customers, these large certificates are not considered core funds as the balances may be temporary and subject to placement with any financial institution offering the highest interest rate bid. Our retail deposit growth is continuously influenced by competitive pressure from other financial institutions, as well as other investment opportunities available to customers.

Such deposits are typically greater than $100 in balance and average balances of CDARS deposits were $16,384 during 2011, $21,409 during 2010, and $14,795 during 2009. Average 2011 CDARS balances declined as local municipalities that fueled 2010 growth seeking 100% FDIC protection withdraw balances for operational needs as well as to invest in other deposit products outside the CDARS program. For regulatory purposes, these deposits are considered brokered deposits and disclosed as such on quarterly regulatory filings. However, for internal and external reporting other than for Call Report purposes, these deposits are considered to be retail deposits since the terms of the account are set directly between us and our local customer on a retail basis. Accordingly, these deposits are included as “Retail time deposits $100 and over” in the Tables in this section. Total CDARS deposits totaled $11,825 and $19,618 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   Originally available under the TARP legislation passed by the federal government during 2008 and now required under the provisions of Dodd-Frank, we participated in the FDIC program, which provided unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest bearing deposits in excess of $250 through December 31, 2012. Although our individual costs of this program beginning in 2011 are not separately stated by the FDIC, additional FDIC insurance fees to participate in this program were approximately $22 and $24 during 2010 and 2009, respectively.       51     Table of Contents      Table 25 provides a breakdown of deposit categories as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.   Table 25: Period-End Deposit Composition       As of December 31,       2011       2010                  $         %            $         %                                                   Non-interest bearing demand       $ 75,298           15.6 %       $ 57,932           12.5 %     Interest-bearing demand and savings         136,950           28.4 %         131,231           28.1 %     Money market deposits         102,993           21.4 %         105,866           22.8 %     Retail time deposits less than $100         45,653           9.5 %         50,993           11.0 %                                                           Total core deposits         360,894           74.9 %         346,022           74.4 %     Retail time deposits $100 and over         46,049           9.6 %         52,404           11.3 %     Broker & national time deposits less than $100         835           0.2 %         1,028           0.2 %     Broker and national time deposits $100 and over         73,731           15.3 %         65,803           14.1 %                                                           Totals       $ 481,509           100.0 %       $ 465,257           100.0 %   Table 26 provides a summary of changes in key deposit categories during 2011 and 2010.   Table 26: Change in Deposit Composition                                   % Change from prior year     At December 31,       2011         2010         2011       2010                                                   Total time deposits $100 and over       $ 119,780         $ 118,207           1.3 %         -0.1 %     Total broker and wholesale deposits         74,566           66,831           11.6 %         -13.4 %     Total retail time deposits         91,702           103,397           -11.3 %         -7.0 %     Core deposits, including money market deposits         360,894           346,022           4.3 %         4.9 %   Table 27 outlines maturities of time deposits of $100 or more, including broker and retail time deposits as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.   Table 27: Maturity Distribution of Certificates of Deposit of $100 or More               2011       2010     As of December 31,       Balance         Rate       Balance         Rate                                                   3 months or less       $ 20,068           1.34 %       $ 17,162           1.67 %     Over 3 months through 6 months         9,972           1.70 %         12,198           1.87 %     Over 6 months through 12 months         25,923           1.54 %         22,031           1.68 %     Over 1 year through 5 years         63,817           2.42 %         66,816           2.70 %     Over 5 years         –           0.00 %         –           0.00 %                                                           Totals       $ 119,780           1.99 %       $ 118,207           2.27 %   2011 compared to 2010   Local core deposits increased $14,872, up 4.3%, at December 31, 2011 compared December 31, 2010. An increase in commercial noninterest-bearing checking of $15,197, or 40.9% led the increase. However, this increase was largely from year-end seasonal deposits that were withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Rewards Checking, a high yield retail NOW account that was the primary driver of deposit growth since 2007 declined $2,609, or 5.2%, to $47,578 at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010. We discontinued sale of Rewards Checking during 2011 and modified the account structure to reduce cost in response to very low short-term national rates and an anticipated decline in debit card interchange income.   Retail time deposits less $100 declined $5,340, or 10.5%, during 2011 as rates paid on certificates of deposit in the current market approached those paid on money market and NOW accounts. Therefore, customers appeared to move funds out of time deposits into nonmaturity accounts that allowed them to access the funds without penalty such as when deposited into a time deposit. Nonmaturity money market and NOW accounts increased $2,846 during 2011.       52     Table of Contents      Rewards Checking was the primary driver of increased deposit growth since its introduction in June 2007 through December 2010. During this period, Rewards Checking supplied approximately 64% of our net core deposit growth. During 2011, we grandfathered existing Rewards Checking customers but discontinued selling the product. Rewards Checking operated as a traditional interest bearing checking account but paid a premium interest rate and reimbursement of foreign ATM fees if the customer meet certain account usage requirements. In general, the account required customers to use their debit card at least 10 times per month, deposit their employer paycheck via ACH, and receive their periodic checking account statement via email from our home banking website. The premium rewards annual percentage yield (“APY”) paid was 2.29% and 3.01% on the first $25 of balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the premium rate paid was 2.01% on the first $15 of deposit balances. The Rewards Checking interest rate is adjustable at our discretion, but was intended to provide the highest potential retail deposit rate product available to customers. The debit card usage requirement substantially increased the amount of debit card interchange income through 2010 as described previously under the section titled “Noninterest income”.   Prior to 2011, the incremental “all-in” cost of Rewards Checking deposits was less than wholesale funding alternatives and was believed to be a long-term cost effective source of funds in addition to providing PSB with a competitive advantage in the retail banking environment and greater control over the repricing of local deposits in a rising rate environment. Rewards Checking balances were $47,578 and $50,187 at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The average interest cost of Rewards Checking balances (excluding debit card interchange fees, savings from delivery of electronic periodic statements and vendor software costs of maintaining the program) was 1.59% in 2011 compared to 2.10% in 2010 and 2.80% in 2009. Average balances in Rewards Checking are expected to remain between $40 million and $45 million during 2012.   Changes to debit card interchange income contained in Dodd-Frank and proposed by the Federal Reserve were anticipated to have a dramatic impact to the profitability of Rewards Checking. We are currently evaluating other product options attractive to our customers that meet market needs and minimize our operating expenses and servicing costs in light of reduced interchange income. These products could replace Rewards Checking or be priced in a manner more attractive than Rewards Checking in light of the potential decrease to debit card interchange income. Because Rewards Checking deposit growth has been the significant driver of local deposit growth in past years, changes to this account structure could reduce future deposit growth.   Although government deposits grew significantly during 2009 from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account, nonmaturity government balances continued a decline of $8,662, or 21.2%, to $32,145 at December 31, 2011, after a decline of $2,890, or 6.6%, to $40,807 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. As loan growth slowed significantly during 2010, we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances. We held $35.3 million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts from our ten largest deposit customers, making up approximately 9% of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December 31, 2011. Many of the balances at year-end were seasonal deposits and expected to be withdrawn during the first several months of 2012. In light of the seasonal nature of many large accounts at year-end and expected low organic loan growth during 2012, we expect small increases to local deposit growth in our existing markets during 2012.   2010 compared to 2009   Local core deposits increased $16,186, up 4.9%, at December 31, 2010 compared December 31, 2009. An increase in commercial money market funds of $13,258, or 42.5%, led the increase in deposits. The increase of $9,989, or 24.9%, in Rewards Checking balances supported a decline in core certificates of deposit of $8,523, or 14.3% during the year. The premium rewards annual percentage yield (“APY”) paid was 2.29% and 3.01% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Rewards Checking balances were $50,187 and $40,198 at December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   Commercial money market balances increased in part from a significant new account opened by a related party during the December 2010 quarter which increased money market deposits by $7,167 at December 31, 2010. These funds were seasonal and declined early in 2011.   Government deposits grew significantly during 2009 from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account but declined $2,890, or 6.6%, to $40,807 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. As loan growth slowed significantly during 2010, we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances. If a new overnight repurchase agreement account opened in 2010 were also included, we held $49.8 million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts form the ten largest customers, making up approximately 12% of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December 31, 2010. Many of the balances at year-end were seasonal deposits and were withdrawn during the first several months of 2011.   Wholesale Funding Sources and Available Liquidity   Our asset-liability management process provides a unified approach to management of liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk, as well as providing adequate funds to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flow of our customers. We view liquidity as the ability to raise cash at a reasonable cost or with a minimum of loss and as a measure of balance sheet flexibility to react to marketplace, regulatory, and competitive changes.       53     Table of Contents      The primary short-term and long-term funding sources we use other than retail deposits include federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks, repurchase agreements from security pledging, advances from the FHLB, use of wholesale time deposits, and advances taken from the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window. Table 29 outlines the available and unused portion of these funding sources (based on collateral and/or company policy limitations) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Currently unused but available funding sources along with a significant amount of overnight liquid funds at December 31, 2011 are considered sufficient to fund anticipated 2012 asset growth.   We maintain formal policies to address liquidity contingency needs and to manage a liquidity crisis. Table 28 provides a summary of how the wholesale funding sources normally available to us would be impacted by various operating conditions.   Table 28: Environmental Impacts on Availability of Wholesale Funding Sources:             Normal     Moderately     Highly           Operating     Stressed     Stressed           Environment     Environment     Environment     Repurchase Agreements     Yes     Likely*     Not Likely     FHLB (primary 1-4 REM collateral)     Yes     Yes*     Less Likely*     FHLB (secondary loan collateral)     Yes     Likely*     Not Likely     Brokered CDs     Yes     Likely*     Not Likely     National CDs     Yes     Likely*     Not Likely     Fed Funds Lines     Yes     Less Likely*     Not Likely     FRB (Borrow-In-Custody)     Yes     Yes     Less Likely*     FRB (Discount Window securities)     Yes     Yes     Yes     Holding Company line of credit     Yes     Yes     Less Likely*   * May be available but subject to restrictions   Table 29 summarizes the availability of various wholesale funding sources at December 31, 2011 and 2010.   Table 29: Available but Unused Funding Sources other than Retail Deposits:               December 31, 2011         December 31, 2010               Unused, but         Amount         Unused, but         Amount               Available         Used         Available         Used                                                     Overnight federal funds purchased       $ 28,000         $ –         $ 25,500         $ –       Federal Reserve discount window advances         100,000           –           94,980           –       FHLB advances under blanket mortgage lien         22,559           50,124           15,056           57,434       Repurchase agreements and other FHLB advances         34,416           19,691           17,177           31,511       Wholesale and national deposits         50,007           74,566           57,388           66,831       Holding company secured line of credit         3,000           –           1,000           –                                                             Totals       $ 237,982         $ 144,381         $ 211,101         $ 155,776                                                             Funding as a percent of total assets         38.2%             23.2 %            34.0%              25.1%     The following discussion examines each of the available but unused funding sources listed in the table above and the factors that may directly or indirectly influence the timing or the amount ultimately available to us.   2011 compared to 2010   Overnight federal funds purchased   Our aggregate federal funds purchased availability of $28,000 is from three correspondent banks. The most significant portion of the total is $15,000 from our primary correspondent bank, Bankers’ Bank located in Madison, Wisconsin, an increase from $12,500 at December 31, 2010. We make regular use of the Bankers’ Bank line as part of our normal daily cash settlement procedures, but rarely have used the lines offered by the other two correspondent banks. Federal funds must be repaid each day and borrowings may be renewed for up to 14 consecutive business days. To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line, we need to maintain a “composite ratio” as defined by Bankers’ Bank of 40% or less. Bankers’ Bank defines the composite ratio to be nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets divided by tangible capital including the allowance for loan losses calculated at our subsidiary bank level. Due to existence of the composite ratio, an increase in nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets could impact availability of the line or subject us to further review. In addition, a rising composite ratio could cause our other two correspondent banks to reconsider their federal funds line with us since they do not also serve as our primary correspondent bank. Our subsidiary bank’s composite ratio was approximately 16% and 21% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and less than the 40% benchmark used by Bankers’ Bank.       54     Table of Contents      Federal Reserve discount window advances   We have a $100,000 line of credit with the Federal Reserve Discount Window supported by a pledge of both commercial and commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve under their Borrower in Custody (“BIC”) program. During 2011, the annualized interest rate applicable to Discount Window advances was .75%. Under the BIC program, we provide a monthly listing of detailed loan information on the loans provided as collateral. We are subject to annual review and certification by the Federal Reserve to retain participation in the program. The Discount Window represents the primary source of liquidity on a daily basis following our federal funds purchased lines of credit discussed above. We were limited to a maximum advance of $100,000 and $94,980 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, based on the BIC loan collateral pledged. Discount Window advances must be repaid or renewed each day. No Discount Window advances were used during 2011.   Only performing loans are permitted as collateral under the BIC and each individual loan is subject to a haircut to collateral value based on the Federal Reserve’s review of the listing each month. In general, approximately 75% of the loan principal offered as collateral is able to support Discount Window advances. Similar to the federal funds purchased lines of credit, an increase in nonperforming loans would decrease the amount of collateral available for Discount Window advances.   Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances   We maintain an available line of credit with the FHLB of Chicago based on a pledge of 1 to 4 family mortgage loan collateral, both first and secondary lien positions. We may borrow on the line to the lesser of the blanket mortgage lien collateral provided, or 20 times our existing FHLB capital stock investment. Based on the our existing $3,250 capital stock investment, total FHLB advances in excess of $65,000 require us to purchase additional FHLB stock equal to 5% of the advance amount. At December 31, 2011, we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to $14,876 of the $22,559 available without the purchase of FHLB stock. At December 31, 2010, we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to $7,566 of the $15,056 available without the purchase of FHLB stock. Further advances of the remaining $7,683 available at December 31, 2011 would have required us to purchase additional FHLB stock totaling $384. FHLB stock pays a nominal dividend of .10% with expectations of continuing this dividend level. Therefore, additional FHLB advances carry additional cost relative to other wholesale borrowing alternatives due to the requirement to hold low yielding FHLB stock.   Similar to the Discount Window, only performing residential mortgage loans may be pledged to the FHLB under the blanket lien. In addition, we are subject to a haircut of approximately 36% on first mortgage collateral and 60% on secondary lien collateral at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The FHLB also conducts periodic audits of collateral identification and submission procedures and adjusts the collateral haircuts higher in response to negative exam findings. The FHLB also assigns a credit risk grade to each member based on a quarterly review of the member’s regulatory CALL report. Our current credit risk is within the normal range for a healthy member bank. Negative financial performance trends such as reduced capital levels, increased nonperforming assets, net operating losses, and other factors can increase a member’s credit risk grade. Higher risk grades can require a member to provide detailed loan collateral listings (rather than a blanket lien), physical collateral, and other restrictions on the maximum line usage. FHLB advances are available on a daily basis and along with Discount Window advances represent a primary source of liquidity following our federal funds purchased lines of credit.   FHLB advances carry substantial penalties for early prepayment that are generally not recovered from the lower interest rates in refinancing. The amount of early prepayment penalty is a function of the difference between the current borrowing rate, and the rate currently available for refinancing. Under a new collateral and pledging agreement we maintain with the FHLB effective April 12, 2011, we are also permitted to pledge commercial related collateral for advances. However, we did not pledge any commercial loan collateral to the FHLB at December 31, 2011.   Recently, the FHLB of Chicago announced a capital stock conversion plan effective January 1, 2012. Under the plan, existing member stock (of which we currently hold $3.25 million) was restructured into two classes. Under the capital conversion plan, the FHLB repurchased $383 of our stock in early 2012. Our remaining shares of $2,867 were restructured and are considered “B-2” capital shares. Excess holdings of B-2 shares may be redeemed by the FHLB at the request of a member following a five year redemption period. However, a member must continue to hold capital stock no less than 5% of outstanding FHLB advances.   Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities   Wholesale repurchase agreements may be available from a correspondent bank counterparty for both overnight and longer terms. Such arrangements typically call for the agreement to be collateralized by us at 110% of the repurchase principal. In the current market, repurchase counterparty providers are extremely limited and would likely require a minimum $10 million transaction. Repurchase agreements could require up to several business days to receive funding. Due to the lack of availability of counterparties offering the product, wholesale repurchase agreements are not a reliable source of liquidity. At December 31, 2011, $13.5 million of our repurchase agreements are wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and $6.2 million are overnight repurchase agreements with local customers using our treasury management services. At December 31, 2010, $13.5 million of our repurchase agreements were wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and $18.0 million were overnight repurchase agreements with local customers.       55     Table of Contents      In addition to availability of FHLB advances under the blanket mortgage lien, we also have the ability to pledge investment securities as collateral against FHLB advances. Advances secured by investments are also subject to the FHLB stock ownership requirement as described previously. Due to the need to purchase additional FHLB member stock, FHLB advances secured by investments are not considered a primary source of liquidity. At December 31, 2011, $34,416, of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional $1,721 of member capital stock were purchased. At December 31, 2010, $17,177 of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional $859 of member capital stock were purchased. The amount available for pledging increased since December 31, 2010 due to an increase in the securities portfolio in general, and a decrease in local customer repurchase agreements, which freed up security collateral for pledging to the FHLB.   Wholesale market deposits   Due to the strength of our capital position, balance sheet, and ongoing earnings, we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market. We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered deposits to 20% of total assets, which gave availability of $50,007 at December 31, 2011 and $57,388 at December 31, 2010. Brokered and national certificates were 12.0% and 10.8% of assets at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Due to a limited number of providers of repurchase agreement funding as well as our desire to retain unencumbered securities for liquidity purposes and adverse impacts from holding additional FHLB capital stock, brokered certificate of deposit funding is expected to increase to the extent future loan growth is not funded with local deposit growth.   Participants in the brokered certificate market must be considered “well capitalized” under current regulatory capital standards to acquire brokered deposits without approval of their primary federal regulator. We regularly acquire brokered deposits from three market providers and maintain relationships with other providers to obtain required funds at the lowest possible cost. Ten business days are typically required between the request for brokered funding and settlement. Therefore, brokered deposits are a reliable, but not daily, source of liquidity. Brokered deposits represent our largest source of wholesale funding and we would see significant negative impacts if capital levels or earnings were to decline to levels not considered to be well capitalized. In addition to the requirement to be considered well-capitalized, banks under regulatory consent orders are not permitted to participate in the brokered deposit market without approval of their primary federal regulator even if they maintain a well-capitalized capital classification.   Holding company unsecured line of credit   We maintained a $3,000 line of credit with a Bankers’ Bank, Madison, Wisconsin as a contingency liquidity source at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, we maintained a $1,000 line of credit with U.S. Bank. No amounts were drawn on either line at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Although our bank subsidiary has in the past provided the holding company’s liquidity needs through semi-annual upstream dividends of profits, losses or other negative performance trends could prevent the bank from providing these dividends as cash flow. Because our bank holding company has approximately $892 of financing payments per year as well as approximately $150 of other expenses (before tax benefits), the holding company line of credit is a critical source of potential liquidity.   We were subject to financial covenants associated with the line as of December 31, 2011 which required our bank subsidiary to:   Maintain Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk based capital, and Tier 2 risk based capital ratios above 8%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. Maintain nonperforming assets (excluding accruing troubled debt restructured loans) as a percentage of tangible equity plus the allowance for loan losses to less than 20%. At December 31, 2011, we were not in violation of any of the line of credit covenants. A violation of any covenant could prevent us from utilizing the unused balance of the line of credit. The line of credit expires during December 2012 but is expected to be renewed upon maturity.   If liquidity needs persist after exhausting all available funds from the sources described above, we would consider more drastic methods to raise funds including, but not limited to, sale of investment securities at a loss, cessation of lending to new or existing customers, sale of branch real estate in a sale-leaseback transaction, surrender of bank owned life insurance to obtain the cash surrender value net of taxes due, packaging and sale of residential mortgage loan pools held in our portfolio, sale of foreclosed assets at a loss, and sale of mortgage servicing rights. Such actions could generate undesirable sale losses or income tax impacts. While sale of additional common stock or issuance of other types of capital could provide additional liquidity, the ability to find significant buyers of such capital issues during a liquidity crisis would be difficult making such a source of funding unlikely or unreliable if the liquidity crisis was caused by our deteriorating financial condition.       56     Table of Contents      2010 compared to 2009   Overnight federal funds purchased   Our aggregate federal funds purchase availability was $25,500 at December 31, 2010 compared to $24,500 at December 31, 2009. To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line, we need to maintain a “composite ratio” as defined by Bankers’ Bank of 40% or less. At December 31, 2010, our subsidiary bank’s composite ratio was approximately 24% and less than the 40% benchmark used by Bankers’ Bank. During 2010 and 2009, the only federal funds line used was our $12,500 line from Bankers’ Bank as part of our regular daily cash management system.   Federal Reserve discount window advances   During 2009, we were granted permission by the Federal Reserve to participate in their Borrower in Custody (“BIC”) program that allows us to pledge performing commercial and commercial real estate loans against overnight Discount Window advances. During 2009, the annualized interest rate due on Discount Window advances was .50%, although this rate was increased to .75% by the Federal Reserve on February 18, 2010. We could draw up to $100 million on our Discount Window line of credit, but were limited to a maximum advance of $94,980 and $74,261 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged. At December 31, 2010, we could borrow on the Discount Window approximately 55% to 60% of the principal amount of loans pledged under the BIC program. No Discount Window advances were used during 2010 or 2009.   Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances   During 2009, the FHLB made available the pledging of certain municipal investment securities against advances, which could increase our maximum advance liquidity with the FHLB, although this increase is not reflected in Table 29 due to specific limitations on the municipal securities eligible to be pledged. Although up to an additional $15,056 of FHLB advances could be obtained on existing mortgage collateral, due to our desire to maintain our current investment in FHLB capital stock of $3,250, the amount of unused but available FHLB advances at December 31, 2010 before additional capital stock would be required is $7,566.   Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities   Securities not pledged to the Federal Reserve for the Discount Window or pledged to the FHLB for advances are available for pledging against repurchase agreements. During 2009, borrower costs related to repurchase agreements increased compared to other wholesale funding alternatives and the number of correspondent banks providing such financing declined. No wholesale repurchase agreements were used during 2010. As an alternative to pledging securities against repurchase agreements, such securities could also be pledged against FHLB advances, as noted previously, subject to the purchase of additional FHLB capital stock for aggregate advances in excess of $65,000.   Wholesale market deposits   Due to the strength of our capital position, balance sheet, and ongoing earnings, we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market. We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered certificates to 20% of total assets, which gave availability of $57,388 at December 31, 2010, and $44,176 at December 31, 2009. Brokered certificates were 10.8% of assets at December 31, 2010 and 12.7% of assets at December 31, 2009.   Holding company unsecured line of credit   Our parent company, PSB Holdings, Inc. maintained a $1,000 line of credit with U.S. Bank as contingency liquidity at the holding company level at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The line of credit remained unused during 2010 and 2009.   Liquidity Measurements and Contingency Plan   Our liquidity management and contingency plan calls for quarterly measurement of key funding, capital, problem loan, and liquidity contingency ratios at our banking subsidiary level. The measurements are compared to various risk levels that direct management to further responses to declining liquidity measurements as outlined below:   Risk Level 1 is defined as circumstances that create the potential for elevated liquidity risk, thus requiring an assessment of possible funding deficiencies. Normal business operations, plans and strategies are not anticipated to be immediately impacted.   Risk Level 2 is defined as circumstances that point to an increased potential for disruptions in the Bank’s funding plans, needs and/or resources. Assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis is more urgent, and identification and prioritization of pre-emptive alternatives and actions may be both warranted and time sensitive.        57     Table of Contents      Risk Level 3 is defined as circumstances that create a likely funding problem, or are symptomatic of circumstances that are highly correlated with impending funding problems; and, therefore, are expected to require some level of immediate action depending upon the situation.    These risk parameters and other qualitative and environmental factors are considered to determine whether a “Stress Level” response is required. Identification of a risk trigger does not automatically call for a stress level response. The following summarizes our response plans to various degrees of liquidity stress:   Stress Level A – Management provides a written summary evaluating the warning indicators and why it is deemed unlikely that there will be a resulting liquidity challenge.   Stress Level B – Management provides an assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis and completes a sources and uses of funds report to estimate the impact on pro forma liquidity. Liquidity stress tests will be reviewed to ensure the scenarios being simulated are sufficiently robust and that there is adequate funding to satisfy potential demands for cash. Various pre-emptive actions will be considered and acted on as needed.   Stress Level C – Management has determined a funding crisis is likely and documents detailed assessments of the current liquidity situation and future liquidity needs. The Board approved action plan is carried out with vigor and may call for one or all of the following steps, among others, to mitigate the liquidity concern: sale of loans, intensify local deposit gathering programs, transferring unencumbered securities and loans to the Federal Reserve for Discount Window borrowings, curtail all lending except for specifically approved loans, reduce or suspend stock dividends, and investigate opportunities to raise new capital.   During 2011, we increased our “Risk Level 1” trigger points related to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans relative to capital. The Risk Level 1 trigger for commercial and industrial loans was increased from 200% of capital at December 31, 2010 to 250% of capital as of December 31, 2011. Likewise, the Risk Level 1 trigger for commercial real estate loans was increased from 300% at December 31, 2010 to 350% at December 31, 2011. These increases were considered appropriate due to our concentration on commercial related lending to local borrowers and relatively low levels of capital, and therefore we consistently exceeded these triggers at the prior year levels. However, we have historically experienced net loan charge-offs on commercial related lending less than similar sized banks and do not consider this mix of loans to signify an undercapitalized position. No Risk Level triggers were exceeded at December 31, 2011 and no liquidity stress levels were considered to exist. At December, 31, 2010, commercial and industrial loans were 215% of capital and commercial real estate loans were 327% of capital, exceeding their “Risk Level 1” trigger points of 200% and 300%, respectively. However, no liquidity stress level was considered to exist at December 31, 2010.   As part of our formal quarterly asset-liability management projections, we also measure basic surplus as the amount of existing net liquid assets (after deducting short-term liabilities and coverage for anticipated deposit funding outflows during the next 30 days) divided by total assets. The basic surplus calculation does not consider unused but available correspondent bank federal funds purchased, as those funds are subject to availability based on the correspondent bank’s own liquidity needs and therefore are not guaranteed contractual funds. However, basic surplus does include unused but available FHLB advances under the open line of credit supported by a blanket lien on mortgage collateral. Basic surplus does not include available brokered certificate of deposit funding as those funds generally may not be obtained within one business day following the request for funding. Our policy is to maintain a basic surplus of at least 5%. Basic surplus was 7.9% and 8.7% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   CAPITAL RESOURCES   We are required to maintain minimum levels of capital to be considered well-capitalized under current banking regulation. Refer to Item 8, Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these requirements and our current capital position relative to these requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for higher regulatory minimums to be considered well capitalized. Although we expect the new capital guidelines to be published in 2012, no written guidance has yet been provided on how much the minimum levels will be raised. In addition, regulatory limitations on fee income and higher compliance burdens are expected to spur a wave of bank consolidation and merger and acquisition activity in the coming years. Acquisition of another bank or bank location for growth would likely pressure our regulatory capital ratios lower and increase the potential for a new common or preferred stock capital issue which could dilute existing stockholders.   The primary increase in stockholders’ equity during the three years ended December 31, 2011 has been retained net income not distributed to stockholders via cash dividends or share buybacks on the open market. Failure to remain well-capitalized would prevent us from obtaining future wholesale broker time deposits which have been an important source of funding during the past several years. Refer to Item 8, Statement of Changes in Stockholder’s Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed activity in the capital accounts. Average tangible common capital to total assets was 8.11% during 2011 and 7.43% during 2010. Table 30 presents a reconciliation of stockholders’ equity as presented in the consolidated balance sheets for the three years ended December 31, 2011 to regulatory capital.       58     Table of Contents      Table 30: Capital Ratios       At December 31,       2011         2010         2009                                                 Stockholders’ equity       $ 50,362         $ 46,690         $ 42,270       Junior subordinated debentures, net         7,500           7,500           7,500       Disallowed mortgage servicing right assets         (121 )         (110 )         (115 )     Accumulated other comprehensive income         (1,934 )         (2,528 )         (1,781 )                                               Tier 1 regulatory capital         55,807           51,552           47,874       Senior subordinated notes         7,000           7,000           7,000       Add:  allowance for loan losses         5,745           5,654           6,121                                                 Total regulatory capital       $ 68,552         $ 64,206         $ 60,995                                                 Average tangible assets       $ 602,071         $ 607,954         $ 589,241                                                 Risk-weighted assets (as defined by current regulations)       $ 457,443         $ 449,987         $ 488,226                                                 Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio)         9.27%           8.48%           8.12%       Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets         12.20%           11.46%           9.81%       Total capital to risk-weighted assets         14.99%           14.27%           12.49%                                                 Capital Ratios – Peoples State Bank – Subsidiary Bank:                                                                                   Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio)         9.99%           9.37%           9.16%       Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets         13.13%           12.64%           11.05%       Total capital to risk-weighted assets         14.39%           13.90%           12.30%     Capital increased $3,672, or 7.9%, during 2011 from retained net income of $4,137 which offset a $594 decline in accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2010, capital increased $4,420, or 10.5%, from retained net income of $3,626 and an increase in unrealized gain on securities available for sale of $767. We pay a regular semi-annual cash dividend as described in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior to 2008, we maintained an informal, annual, ongoing share repurchase program of up to 1% of outstanding shares per year as described in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the difficulty and related cost of raising new capital to support asset growth at this time, we temporarily suspended the buyback program beginning during 2008 and no shares were repurchased during the three years ended December 31, 2011. While we do not expect to buyback a significant number of shares as treasury stock during 2012, share repurchases on the open market are one strategy we could consider to build shareholder value if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year.   During 2009, we issued $7,000 of senior subordinated notes to provide regulatory capital to support commercial loan growth during 2007 and 2008. Refer to Item 8, Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the issue. Beginning July 1, 2012, we have the ability to repay the Notes in part or in full. Repayment of the Notes to reduce interest expense is a strategy that could be considered during 2012 if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year.   We have issued trust preferred securities represented by junior subordinated debentures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which may provide up to 25% of our total Tier 1 regulatory capital. Refer to Item 8, Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the trust preferred security issue. The Dodd-Frank Act no longer permits us to issue new trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital as in prior years, although our existing $7.5 million trust preferred capital securities are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital.   Senior Subordinated Notes and Junior Subordinated Debentures represent approximately 21% of our total regulatory capital. Unlike our common stock, these capital obligations require regular quarterly interest payments that may not be eliminated if our financial condition were to deteriorate (although the interest payments on junior subordinated notes could be deferred for up to five years before considered a default of the debt). Therefore, we expect any future capital needs during the next several years beyond retained earnings from operations to be met via issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock, although no current plans for issuance of common or preferred stock exist.       59     Table of Contents      In December 2010, the U.S. Treasury introduced a new small bank capital program known as the “Small Business Lending Fund” established by the Small Business Jobs Act with funding up to $30 billion in an effort to spur small business lending. Under the program, only available to well performing banks less than $10 billion in assets such as us, banks may issue Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury with a variable dividend rate that could later be fixed as low as 1% depending on the level of small business lending growth during the first 10 quarters following issuance of the preferred stock. The preferred stock dividend later resets to 9% on the 4 ½ year anniversary of the preferred stock issue until repaid. We decided not to participate in the Small Business Lending Fund due to concerns over the extent of organic loan growth available and strict limitations on using the capital to support assets obtained in purchase of another bank as well has our historically high level of existing regulatory capital.   We are considered well-capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of 14.99% at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.27% at December 31, 2010. Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of 10.00% to be considered well-capitalized. During 2010, total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to 50% risk weighting, rather than the 100% risk weighting assigned in prior years. In addition, we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during 2010 which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio. These changes, along with retained 2010 net income, increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than 2009.   We maintain an incentive stock option plan approved by stockholders during 2001 and a restricted stock plan as described in Item 8, Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total expense recognized under both plans was $78, $43, and $25, during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.   As a measurement of the adequacy of a bank’s capital base related to its level of nonperforming assets, many investors use a “non-GAAP” measure commonly referred to as the “Texas Ratio.” We also track changes in our Texas Ratio against our internal capital and liquidity risk parameters to highlight negative capital trends that could impact our ability for future growth, payment of dividends to shareholders, or other factors. As noted previously, correspondent bank providers of our daily federal funds purchased line of credit and the holding company operating line of credit use similar measures that impact our ability to continued use of those lines of credit if our level of nonperforming assets to capital were to rise above prescribed levels. The following table presents the calculation of our Texas Ratio.   Table 31: Calculation of “Texas Ratio” (a non-GAAP measure) as of December 31,       (dollars in thousands)       2011         2010         2009                                           Total nonperforming assets       $ 17,883         $ 16,389         $ 17,074                                                 Total stockholders’ equity       $ 50,362         $ 46,690         $ 42,270       Less: Mortgage servicing rights, net (intangible assets)         (1,205 )         (1,100 )         (1,147 )     Less: Preferred stock capital elements         –           –           –       Add:  Allowance for loan losses         7,941           7,960           7,611                                                 Total tangible common stockholders’ equity and reserves       $ 57,098         $ 53,550         $ 48,734                                                 Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of                                            total tangible common stockholders’ equity and reserves         31.32%           30.61%           35.04%         60     Table of Contents      OFF-BALANCE-SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   We service residential mortgage loans originated by our lenders and sold to the FHLB and FNMA. As a FHLB Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) loan servicer, we provide a credit enhancement guarantee to reimburse the FHLB for foreclosure losses in excess of 1% of the original loan principal sold to the FHLB prior to November 2008. Refer to Item 8, Notes 4, 6, and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the FHLB MPF program. These first mortgage loans are underwritten using standardized criteria we consider to be conservative on residential properties in our local communities. We believe loans serviced for the FHLB will realize minimal foreclosure losses in the future and that we will experience no loan losses related to charge-offs in excess of the FHLB 1% First Loss Account. The north central Wisconsin residential real estate market is experiencing similar home value declines as the state of Wisconsin as a whole, which are moderate when compared to other states in the country. The average residential first mortgage originated by us under the FHLB program which required a credit enhancement was approximately $154 in 2008 and $140 during 2007, the last two years of the program.   Under bank regulatory capital rules, this FHLB recourse obligation to the FHLB is risk-weighted for the purposes of the total capital to risk-weighted assets capital calculation. Total risk-based capital required to be held for the recourse obligations under the FHLB MPF programs for capital adequacy purposes was $1,859 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and $1,901 at December 31, 2009. During October 2008, we ceased origination and sale of loans to the FHLB that required a credit enhancement and no additional risk-based capital will be required to support such loans. More information on all loans serviced for other investors, including FHLB and FNMA, is outlined in Table 32.   Other significant off-balance sheet financial instruments include the various loan commitments outlined in Item 8, Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon.   During 2011, we sold a new product that allowed certain adjustable rate commercial loan customers to fix their interest rate with an interest rate swap. Refer to Item 8, Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the program. At December 31, 2011, there were $14,324 in interest rate swaps outstanding under the program.   Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing   We service $261,811 and $260,097 of residential real estate loans which have been sold to the FHLB and FNMA at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Loans sold to FHLB and FNMA are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. An annualized servicing fee equal to .25% of outstanding principal is retained from payments collected from the customer as compensation for servicing the loan for the FHLB and FNMA.   For loans originated and sold to the FHLB prior to November 2008, we are also paid an annualized “credit enhancement” fee of .07% to .10% of outstanding serviced principal in addition to the .25% collected for servicing the loan for the FHLB impacting $51,518, or 20%, of loans serviced for the FHLB at December 31, 2011 compared to $70,209, or 27%, at December 31, 2010. See also “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” in Item 8, Note 17 and “Loans” in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage loan servicing and credit enhancement fees have been an important source of mortgage banking income. Because no further loans are sold to the FHLB with our credit enhancement, we expect credit enhancement fees to decline in future years as this serviced principal is repaid. Credit enhancements fees were $16 in 2011, $29 in 2010, and $105 in 2009. Refer to Item 8, Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of mortgage banking revenue. We recognize a mortgage servicing right asset due to the substantial volume of loans serviced for the FHLB and FNMA. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our mortgage servicing right accounting policies.   Losses incurred by the FHLB on loans in the MPF 100 program and the MPF 125 program are absorbed by the FHLB in their First Loss Account. If cumulative losses were to exceed the First Loss Account, we would reimburse the FHLB for any excess losses up to the extent of our Credit Enhancement Guarantee. Ten years after the original pool master commitment date, the First Loss Account and the Credit Enhancement Guarantee are reset to current levels based on loans remaining in the pool. These factors are further reset every subsequent five years until the pool is repaid. During 2010, the MPF 100 program reached its ten year anniversary and the First Loss Account and Credit Enhancement Guarantee associated with that program were reset to the new level shown in Table 32. The next First Loss Account reset date for any individual master commitment containing our Credit Enhancement Guarantee is scheduled for August 18, 2013.   Due to historical strength of mortgage borrowers in our markets and relative stability of collateral home values, and the original 1% of principal First Loss Account provided by the FHLB, we believe the possibility of losses under guarantees to the FHLB to be remote. Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in 2000, only $0.3 million of $425 million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss, all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account. Accordingly, no provision for a recourse liability has been made for this recourse obligation on loans currently serviced by us. Loans originated and sold to the FHLB under their XTRA program do not require credit enhancement and PSB has no risk of principal loss on such loans properly underwritten and sold.       61     Table of Contents      All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities. Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations. During 2011, we were required to repurchase a foreclosed loan and incur a $37 loss related to underwriting violations related to private mortgage guarantee insurance. We have reviewed our existing portfolio and believe we do not have continued risk for significant loss on other loans that could have this underwriting issue. Other than this loan, we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since 2000 and have never been required to repurchase a loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expect to be required to repurchase loans in the near term.   Table 32 summarizes the various programs and investors for which we serviced loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.   Table 32: Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing for Others   At December 31, 2011:                                   Weighted       Avg.

During 2011, the serviced portfolio increased just $1,714, or 0.7%, and we do not expect significant serviced loan growth during 2012.   Contractual Obligations   We are a party to various contractual obligations requiring use of funds as part of our normal operations. Table 33 outlines the principal amounts and timing of these obligations, excluding amounts due for interest, if applicable. Nonmaturity deposits and overnight federal funds purchased and overnight repurchase obligations are not included in Table 33 because they are not classified as long-term obligations. Most of these obligations shown in the Table, including FHLB advances and time deposits, are routinely refinanced into a similar replacement obligation without requiring any substantial outflow of cash. However, renewal of these obligations is dependent on our ability to offer competitive market equivalent interest rates or availability of collateral for pledging such as retained mortgage loans or securities as in the case of advances from the FHLB. Our funds management policy includes a formal liquidity contingency plan to identify low cost and liquid funds available in the event of a liquidity crisis as outlined under the section labeled, “LIQUIDITY” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       62     Table of Contents      Table 33: Long-Term Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2011               Principal payments due by period               Total         < 1 year         1-3 years         3-5 years         > 5 years                                                                         Federal Home Loan Bank advances       $ 50,124         $ –         $ 50,124         $ –         $ –       Long-term other borrowings         13,500           –           8,000           –           5,500       Junior subordinated debentures         7,732           –           –           –           7,732       Senior subordinated notes         7,000           –           –           –           7,000       Deferred compensation agreements         2,378           27           264           370           1,717       Post-retirement health insurance benefits plan         78           8           17           19           34       Long-term charitable contribution commitments         25           4           10           11           –       Branch bank operating lease commitments         23           23           –           –           –                                                                         Total long-term contractual obligations before time deposits         80,860           62           58,415           400           21,983       Time deposits         166,268           84,417           51,414           30,437           –                                                                         Total long-term contractual obligations including time deposits       $ 247,128         $ 84,479         $ 109,829         $ 30,837         $ 21,983         Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     43     ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Overview Income . Newport Federal’s primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that the Bank pays on deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are customer service fees (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts), loan servicing fees and income from bank-owned life insurance. Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Bank evaluates the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. Expenses. The non-interest expenses Newport Federal incurs in operating its business consist of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, data processing and other expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to the Bank’s employees, stock-based compensation, payroll taxes, expenses for health insurance, retirement plans, and other employee benefits. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to forty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. The expected term includes lease option periods to the extent that the exercise of such options is reasonably assured.     23     Table of Contents        Data processing expenses are the fees paid to third parties for processing customer information, deposits and loans. Other expenses include expenses for professional services, marketing, office supplies, postage, telephone, insurance, charitable contributions, FDIC deposit insurance and OCC assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses. Critical Accounting Policies Newport Bancorp considers accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on results of operations to be critical accounting policies. The Company considers the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of the net deferred tax asset to be our critical accounting policies. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management evaluates the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon a review of the collectability of the loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. Although management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews Newport Federal’s allowance for loan losses. Such agency may require the Bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would adversely affect earnings. The allowance consists of general and allocated loss components. For loans that are classified as impaired, an allocated loss allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or the collateral value of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by the fair value of the collateral. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer loans for impairment disclosures. Income Taxes. Management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation. The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when, in the judgment of management, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by (1) reviewing taxable       24     Table of Contents      income in allowable federal carry-back periods, and (2) assessing the likelihood of the Company generating federal and state taxable income, as applicable, in future periods in amounts sufficient to offset the deferred tax charges they are expected to reverse. Adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited, respectively, to income tax expense. Balance Sheet Analysis Overview. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company’s assets increased by $4.2 million, or 0.9%, to $453.9 million. The increase in assets was concentrated in cash and cash equivalents, which increased by $21.7 million, or 231.5%, offset in part by a $10.8 million, or 23.0%, decrease in securities and a $7.6 million, or 2.1%, decrease in net loans. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is due to principal payments received on mortgage-backed securities and an increase in deposits. Loans . Newport Federal’s primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate.

(4) Loans are presented before the allowance for loan losses but include deferred costs/fees. Construction loans are included net of unadvanced funds.   Net income in 2011 was $1.5 million compared to $1.8 million in 2010. The decrease was due to the $218,000 decrease in the Bank’s net interest income, the $165,000 increase in the provision for loan losses and the $280,000 increase in non-interest expenses, partially offset by the $203,000 increase in non-interest income and the $110,000 decrease in the tax provision.       30     Table of Contents          Average Balances and Yields . The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. For purposes of this table, average balances have been calculated using daily average balances, nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only, and loan fees are included in interest income on loans. None of the income reflected in the following table is tax-exempt income.             Years Ended December 31,               2011         2010         2009               Average Balance

Analysis . The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.             2011 Compared to 2010               Increase (Decrease) Due to               Volume         Rate         Net               (Dollars in thousands)       Interest income:                                         Loans       $ 164         $ (1,088 )       $ (924 )     Securities         (264 )         (78 )         (342 )     Other interest-earning assets         1           24           25       Total interest-earning assets         (99 )         (1,142 )         (1,241 )                                               Interest expense:                                         Deposits         (22 )         (748 )         (770 )     Borrowings         (3 )         (250 )         (253 )     Total interest-bearing liabilities         (25 )         (998 )         (1,023 )     Change in net interest income       $ (74 )       $ (144 )       $ (218 )   Net Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $14.9 million, compared to $15.2 million for the year December 31, 2010, a decrease of 1.4%, primarily due to a 1 basis point decrease in the Company’s net interest rate spread. The decrease in net interest income during 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in the interest earned on loans and securities, partially offset by a decrease in the expense from deposits and borrowings. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased to 5.25% in 2011 from 5.53% in 2010, a decrease of 28 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.76% in 2011 from 2.03% in 2010, a decrease of 27 basis points. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased by 33 basis points, as a result of the continued low interest rate environment in 2011. With the short-term market interest rates at their current all-time low levels, customers continue to show a preference for higher-yielding core accounts and short-term time deposits, rather than the longer-term time deposit accounts. The average balance of borrowings decreased $73,000 in 2011 and the low interest rate environment contributed towards the $253,000, or 18 basis points, decrease in total cost of borrowings from 2010 to 2011. When older and higher-cost borrowings matured, newer and lower-cost borrowings were purchased, which contributed towards decrease in the cost of borrowings during 2011.   Provision for Loan Losses. The loan loss provision for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was $1.1 million and $956,000, respectively. The provision increased primarily due to an increase in loan charge-offs and problem loans, partially offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio.   Non-Interest Income. The following table shows the components of non-interest income and the percentage changes from year to year.             Years Ended December 31,                         2011         2010         %Change              (Dollars in thousands)                                                           Customer service fees       $ 1,929         $ 1,868           3.3 %     Net loss on sale of securities available for sale         -           (121 )         100.0       Bank-owned life insurance         383           387           (1.0 )     Miscellaneous         74           49           51.0       Total       $ 2,386         $ 2,183           9.3 %   Non-interest income for 2011 totaled $2.4 million, an increase of $203,000, or 9.3%, compared to 2010. The increase in non-interest income is primarily due to the $61,000 increase in fees earned on checking accounts and no loss on sales of securities available for sale recorded in 2011, as compared to the $121,000 net realized loss on sales     32     Table of Contents        of securities available for sale recorded in 2010. The loss on sales of securities available for sale in 2010 was due to the sale of the Bank’s entire holdings in one mutual fund, which resulted in a $267,000 realized loss, partially offset by gains on sales of other securities available for sale.   Non-Interest Expense. The following table shows the components of non-interest expense and the percentage changes for the years indicated.             Years Ended December 31,                       2011         2010         % Change               (Dollars in thousands)                                                           Salaries and employee benefits       $ 7,699         $ 7,651           0.6 %     Occupancy and equipment         2,185           1,873           16.7       Data processing         1,564           1,503           4.1       Professional fees         535           458           16.8       Marketing         711           959           (25.9 )     Foreclosed real estate         182           64           184.4       FDIC insurance         343           459           (25.3 )     All other         748           720           3.9       Total       $ 13,967         $ 13,687           2.0                                                 Efficiency ratio         80.64 %         78.96 %         2.1 %   Total non-interest expenses for 2011 increased to $14.0 million from $13.7 million for 2010, an increase of 2.0%. The increase between the two years is attributable to an increase in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing fees, professional fees, foreclosed real estate and other general and administrative costs, offset by decreases in marketing fees and FDIC insurance costs. The increase in salaries and benefits is primarily due to an increase in retirement and health benefit costs, partially offset by a reduction in the stock-based compensation expense associated with option grants and restricted stock awards. The accelerated method of expense recognition was adopted at the inception of the equity incentive plan on October 1, 2007, resulting in a higher stock-based compensation expense in 2010 compared to 2011. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense and data processing fees is due to the overall increase in operating costs and an increase in depreciation expense in 2011 as a result of a relocation of an existing branch in the beginning of 2011. The increase in the foreclosed real estate expense is a result of an overall increase in foreclosed real estate assets. The decrease in marketing costs is a result of management’s decision to reduce marketing expenditures in 2011. The decrease in FDIC insurance was a result of the FDIC regulation that changed its assessment system for deposit insurance coverage from one based on domestic deposits to one based on consolidated total average assets less tangible equity and revised the assessment rate schedule. This regulation, effective for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, resulted in a lower expense in deposit insurance coverage in 2011 compared to 2010. Income Tax Expense.  The income tax expense for 2011 was $782,000 compared to the income tax expense of $892,000 for 2010. The effective tax rates were 35.0% and 33.1% in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The effective tax rate increase is due primarily to the decrease in the charitable contribution deduction from what was estimated in 2010. The effective tax rates in 2011 and 2010 also include the non-deductible compensation expense recorded for a portion of the incentive stock options, partially offset by non-taxable BOLI income.  The deferred tax assets applicable to loss carry forwards relating to the deduction for the donation to the charitable foundation in 2006 are recoverable, only to the extent that 10% pre-tax of income exceeds the deduction during the five-year carryforward period.  At December 31, 2011, this loss carryforward expired and the Company reversed the valuation allowance of $868,000 against the deferred tax asset related to this loss carryforward.  In addition, securities available for sale that were previously impaired were sold in 2010, creating a capital loss carryover and a related valuation allowance of $304,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  For additional information regarding deferred tax assets, see Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.       33     Table of Contents      Risk Management Overview . Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Newport Bancorp’s most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks that the Company faces are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue. Credit Risk Management . Newport Federal’s strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, the Bank takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the loan becomes 15 days past due a late notice is sent to the borrower. When the loan becomes 18 days past due, a more formal letter is sent. When a loan becomes 25 days past due, the borrower is typically called. After 30 days, the Bank regards the borrower as in default. The borrower is promptly sent a letter from the Bank’s attorney and the Bank may commence collection proceedings. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Generally, when a consumer loan becomes 60 days past due, the Bank institutes collection proceedings and attempts to repossess any personal property that secures the loan. Management informs the board of directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days, all loans in foreclosure and repossessed property that it owns. Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets . Newport Bancorp considers repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations. Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan. The following table provides information with respect to the Bank’s nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.             At December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               (Dollars in thousands)       Nonaccrual loans:                                                                 One-to-four family real estate       $ 1,052         $ 108         $ -         $ -         $ -       Multi-family real estate         858           -           -           -           -       Commercial real estate         -           -           860           -           908       Total         1,910           108           860           -           908                                                                         Accruing loans past due 90 days or more         -           -           -           -           -       Total nonperforming loans         1,910           108           860           -           908                                                                         Foreclosed real estate         839           100           -           -           -       Other nonperforming assets         -           -           -           -           -       Total nonperforming assets       $ 2,749         $ 208         $ 860         $ -         $ 908                                                                                                                                           Total nonperforming loans to total loans         0.55 %         0.03 %         0.24 %         0.00 %         0.31 %     Total nonperforming loans to total assets         0.42 %         0.02 %         0.19 %         0.00 %         0.25 %     Total nonperforming assets to total assets         0.61 %         0.05 %         0.19 %         0.00 %         0.25 %       34     Table of Contents      Gross interest income that would have been recorded for 2011 had nonaccruing loans been current according to their original terms, amounted to $91,000. The amount of interest income on such loans that was included in net income in 2011 was $58,000. The Bank did not have any troubled debt restructurings at any of the dates presented. Nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2011, consist of two one-to-four family residential mortgages and one multi-family residential real estate mortgage. There are no losses expected on these loans. Federal regulations require Newport Federal to review and classify the Bank’s assets on a regular basis. In addition, the OCC has the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. When the Bank classifies an asset as substandard or doubtful, the asset is assessed for impairment, and if impaired, a specific valuation allowance for loan losses is established. If classified loans are not deemed to be impaired, the Bank applies a general reserve as further described below. If Newport Federal classifies an asset as loss, it is charged off at an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified loss. The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified and special mention assets at the dates indicated.             At December 31,               2011         2010         2009               (Dollars in thousands)                                                 Special mention loans       $ 10,294         $ 10,030         $ 6,242       Substandard loans         6,782           3,204           4,570       Substandard securities         -           -           3,582       Doubtful assets         -           -           -       Loss assets         -           -           -       Total classified assets       $ 17,076         $ 13,234         $ 14,394     At December 31, 2011, loans classified as substandard, which the Company considers to be potential problem loans, consist of six commercial real estate mortgages, two multi-family residential real estate mortgages and two one-to-four family residential real estate mortgages.       35     Table of Contents        Delinquencies .

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Newport Federal evaluates the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.   Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of: (1) an allocated valuation allowance on identified impaired loans; and (2) a general allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although the Bank determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio. Allocated Allowance on Identified Impaired Loans. Newport Federal identifies impaired loans by reviewing all delinquent loans, classified loans and other loans that management may have concerns about collectability. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. General Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio. Newport Federal establishes a general allowance for loans that are not impaired loans, to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities. This general allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan type and risk classification and assigning allowance percentages to each category. The percentages are adjusted for significant changes in factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, duration of the current business cycle and bank regulatory examination results. The applied loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment. The Bank engages an independent third party to conduct an annual review of its commercial real estate portfolio. This loan review, which typically includes a 50% penetration of the commercial real estate portfolio, provides a credit evaluation of individual loans to determine whether the risk ratings assigned are appropriate. The OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The OCC may require the Bank to make additional provisions for loan losses based on judgments different from ours.     36     Table of Contents        At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the allowance for loan losses represented 1.05% and 1.02% of total loans, respectively. No portion of the allowance was allocated to impaired loans at December 31, 2011 or 2010. The allowance for loan losses was $3.7 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the loan portfolio was primarily due to additional general reserves provided due to an increase in classified loans that, although currently performing, represent increased risk. The Bank currently does not originate sub-prime residential mortgage loans. There are $17.1 million of classified and criticized loans that are under watch by management. Total classified and criticized loans consist of $6.8 million in the substandard category and $10.3 million in the special mention category. The special mention category consists of $8.3 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.9 million of multi-family real estate loans and $44,000 of commercial loans. The substandard category consists of $4.6 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 million of multi-family real estate loans and $1.1 million of one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Total classified and criticized loans represent 4.8% of the Company’s total gross loans.             37     Table of Contents      The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.             At December 31,               2011         2010               Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of Loans in Category To Total Loans         Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of Loans in Category To Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Real estate mortgage:                                                                             Residential                                                                                One-to-four family       $ 1,070           28.85 %         58.79 %       $ 1,028           28.00 %         56.49 %        Multi-family         339           9.50           5.17           377           10.27           6.25          Equity loans and lines         147           3.96           5.55           173           4.71           6.40       Commercial         2,034           54.49           28.64           1,976           53.81           28.96          Construction         94           2.53           1.42           89           2.42           1.37       Commercial         19           0.51           0.32           25           0.68           0.45       Consumer         6           0.16           0.11           4           0.11           0.08       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 3,709           100.00 %         100.00 %       $ 3,672           100.00 %         100.00 %               At December 31,               2009         2008               Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of Loans in Category To Total Loans         Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of Loans in Category To Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Real estate mortgage:                                                                             Residential                                                                                One-to-four family       $ 956           27.57 %         53.67 %       $ 916           31.33 %         54.53 %        Multi-family         338           9.75           6.33           260           8.89           5.16          Equity loans and lines         142           4.10           7.27           167           5.71           9.03       Commercial         1,833           52.87           29.42           1,372           46.92           27.14          Construction         167           4.82           2.73           168           5.75           3.32       Commercial         28           0.81           0.52           32           1.09           0.64       Consumer         3           0.08           0.06           9           0.31           0.18       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 3,467           100.00 %         100.00 %       $ 2,924           100.00 %         100.00 %                                                                                             At December 31,               2007               Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of Loans in Category To Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Real estate mortgage:                                         Residential                                            One-to-four family       $ 835           34.80 %         57.08 %        Multi-family         137           5.71           3.20          Equity loans and lines         170           7.09           10.44       Commercial         1,096           45.69           25.51          Construction         136           5.67           3.18       Commercial         19           0.79           0.44       Consumer         6           0.25           0.15       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 2,399           100.00 %         100.00 %                                                 38     Table of Contents      Although management believes the best information available was used to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, will not require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Analysis of Loan Loss Experience.

The Company’s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Newport Bancorp manages the interest rate sensitivity of its interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, the Company has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Newport Bancorp’s strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: adjusting the maturities of borrowings; adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration; and periodically selling fixed-rate mortgage loans and available-for-sale investment securities.     39     Table of Contents        The Company has an Asset Liability Management Committee to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals. Quantitative Aspects of Market Risk. The Company uses an interest rate sensitivity analysis prepared by the OCC to review our level of interest rate risk. This analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. This analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 50 to 300 basis point increase or 50 to 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement. Newport Bancorp measures interest rate risk by modeling the changes in net portfolio value over a variety of interest rate scenarios. The following table presents the change in the net portfolio value at December 31, 2011, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on OCC assumptions, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.

These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates, and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. The Committee also measures and evaluates interest rate risk using income simulation analysis. This analysis considers the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities, as well as the relative sensitivities of these balance sheet components over a range of interest rate scenarios. Interest rate scenarios tested generally include instantaneous rate shocks, rate ramps over a one-year period, and static (or flat) rates. The simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specified time horizon, usually a two-year period.     40     Table of Contents      The table below sets forth, as of November 30, 2011, the estimated changes in Newport Bancorp’s net interest income that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the U.S. Treasury yield curve. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates, loan prepayments and deposit decay, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.                    % Change         in Estimated         Net Interest Income Over         the Next 12 Months                    % Change         in Estimated         Net Interest Income Over         Months 13-24     200 basis point increase in rates     0.1%           (3.8)%     Flat interest rates     0.0%           1.4%     100 basis point decrease in rates     0.2%           (0.6)%   As indicated in the table above, the result of an immediate 200 basis point parallel increase in interest rates is estimated to increase net interest income by 0.1% over a 12-month horizon, and decrease net interest income by 3.8% for months 13-24, when compared to the flat rate scenario, which assumes no increase in interest-bearing checking rates except for high balance interest bearing checking which increase 75 basis points (BP), an increase in savings rates of 50-75 BP and an increase in money market rates of 150 basis points. These assumptions are based on the Bank’s past experience with the changes in rates paid on these non-maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates. The estimated change in net interest income from the flat rate scenario for a 100 basis point parallel decline in the level of interest rates is an increase of 0.2% over the 12 month horizon and a decrease of 0.6% for months 13-24, which assumes no decrease in interest-bearing checking rates, except for high balance accounts which decrease 5 BP, savings rates decreasing 3-5 BP and a decrease in money market rates of 25-38 basis points. These assumptions are based on the Bank’s past experience with the changes in rates paid on these non-maturity deposits coincident with changes in market interest rates. There are inherent shortcomings in income simulation, given the number and variety of assumptions that must be made in performing the analysis. The assumptions relied upon in making these calculations of interest rate sensitivity include the level of market interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, the degree to which certain assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods to repricing react to changes in market interest rates, the degree to which non-maturity deposits react to changes in market rates, the expected prepayment rates on loans and mortgage-backed securities, the degree to which early withdrawals occur on certificates of deposit and the volume of other deposit flows. As such, although the analysis shown above provides an indication of Newport Bancorp’s sensitivity to interest rate changes at a point in time, these estimates are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on Newport Bancorp’s net interest income and will differ from actual results.     41     Table of Contents      The table below shows Newport Bancorp’s interest rate sensitivity gap position at December 31, 2011, indicating the amount of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that are anticipated to mature or reprice in each of the future time periods shown. Generally, these assets and liabilities are shown in the table based on the earlier of the time remaining to repricing or contractual maturity. However, savings, money market deposit and interest bearing deposit accounts are assumed to have an annual rate of withdrawal (decay rate) of 10%.             At December 31, 2011               Up to One Year         More than One Year to Two Years         More than Two Years to Three Years         More than Three Years to Five Years         More than Five Years         Total               (Dollars in thousands)       Interest-earning assets:                                                                             Loans       $ 8,266         $ 8,949         $ 7,524         $ 27,404         $ 301,244         $ 353,387       Securities         -           22           -           -           36,198           36,220       Short-term investments         11,335           -           -           -           -           11,335       Total interest-earning assets         19,601           8,971           7,524           27,404           337,442           400,942                                                                                     Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                                             Savings deposits         3,214           2,893           2,604           2,343           21,089           32,143       Money market deposits         4,898           4,409           3,968           3,571           32,140           48,986       Interest-bearing demand deposits         7,323           6,591           5,932           5,339           48,048           73,233       Certificates of deposits         50,654           4,984           1,670           9,582           3,649           70,539       Borrowings         36,009           32,000           10,500           29,687           25,500           133,696       Total interest-bearing liabilities         102,098           50,877           24,673           50,522           130,426           358,596       Interest rate sensitivity gap       $ (82,497 )       $ (41,906 )       $ (17,149 )       $ (23,118 )       $ 207,016         $ 42,346                                                                                     Interest rate sensitivity gap as a % of total assets         (18.18 )%         (9.23 )%         (3.78 )%         (5.09 )%         45.61 %                                                                                               Cum. interest rate sensitivity gap       $ (82,497 )       $ (124,403 )       $ (141,552 )       $ (164,670 )       $ 42,346                                                                                                 Cum. interest rate sensitivity gap as a % of total assets         (18.18 )%         (27.41 )%         (31.19 )%         (36.28 )%         9.33 %             Liquidity Management . Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. The primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. The Bank regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management policy. The most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits. The levels of these assets depend on the operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents totaled $31.1 million. At December 31, 2011, we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately $50.8 million of additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. On December 31, 2011, we had $93.7 million of advances outstanding. At December 31, 2011, the Bank had $24.9 million in loan commitments outstanding, which consisted of $4.7 million of real estate loan commitments, $14.6 million in unused home equity lines of credit, $2.4 million in construction loan commitments and $3.2 million in commercial lines of credit commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2011 totaled $50.7 million, or 71.8% of certificates of deposit. The large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customer’s hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the recent low interest rate environment. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, Newport Federal may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before December 31, 2012. The Bank believes,     42     Table of Contents        however, based on past experience, that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with the Bank. Newport Federal has the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. The Bank’s primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities. The primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by Newport Federal and our local competitors and other factors. The Bank generally manages the pricing of our deposits to be competitive. Occasionally, promotional rates are offered on certain deposit products to attract deposits. Capital Resources. The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2011, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements. We are considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements . In the normal course of operations, Newport Federal engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about the Company’s loan commitments and unused lines of credit, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company did not engage in any off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  For a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements, see note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices The financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.     ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS     34 Item 7.	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   BUSINESS   Salisbury, a Connecticut corporation, formed in 1998, is the bank holding company for the Bank, a Connecticut-chartered and FDIC insured commercial bank headquartered in Lakeville, Connecticut. Salisbury’s principal business consists of the business of the Bank. The Bank, formed in 1848, is engaged in customary banking activities, including general deposit taking and lending activities to both retail and commercial markets, and trust and wealth advisory services. The Bank conducts its banking business from eight full-service offices in the towns of Canaan, Lakeville, Salisbury and Sharon, Connecticut, South Egremont and Sheffield, Massachusetts, and, Dover Plains and Millerton, New York, and its trust and wealth advisory services from offices in Lakeville, Connecticut.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements follow GAAP as applied to the banking industry in which it operates. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event.   Salisbury’s significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and, along with this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, provide information on how significant assets are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating Salisbury’s reported financial results, and they require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.   The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience, and consideration of current economic trends and conditions, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the balance sheet. Note 1 describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses are included in the “Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.   Management evaluates goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment annually using valuation techniques that involve estimates for discount rates, projected future cash flows and time period calculations, all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors. Future events or changes in the estimates, which are used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations.   Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment giving consideration to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, estimates of future cash flows, delinquencies and default severity, and the intent and ability of Salisbury to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. The consideration of the above factors is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management, the actual realization of gains or losses on investment securities could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements.   The determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts. Key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs. Actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and other postretirement obligations and expense.   OVERVIEW   Net income available to common shareholders for 2011 was $3,588,000, or $2.12 per common share, compared with $3,198,000, or $1.90 per common share, for 2010. Selected 2011 highlights are as follows:             ·     Earnings per common share increased $0.22, or 11.58%, to $2.12.                 -     Common stock dividends were $1.12 per share, unchanged from 2010.                 -     Preferred stock dividends and accretion were $524,000, versus $462,000 for 2010.           ·     Tax equivalent net interest income increased $1,323,000, or 7.27%.                 -     Net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 3.51% from 3.37%                 -     Net loans increased $18.3 million, or 5.20%.                 -     Total deposits increased $41.0 million, or 9.53%.                 -     FHLBB advances decreased $18.2 million, or 24.99%.           ·     Provision for loan losses was $1,440,000, versus $1,000,000 for 2010. Net loan charge-offs were $1,284,000 and $553,000, respectively, for 2011 and 2010.                 -     Non-performing assets declined to 1.78% of total assets at December 31, 2011, down from peak of 2.55% of total assets at June 30, 2011, and versus 1.87% of total assets at December 31, 2010.       19     Table of Contents                  ·     Non-interest income increased $349,000, or 6.58%.                 -     Trust and Wealth Advisory assets under management increased $16.0 million, or 4.64%.                 -     Mortgage loan sales totaled $30.9 million, versus $42.7 million for 2010.           ·     Non-interest expense increased $526,000, or 3.07%.                 -     Core efficiency ratio decreased to 68.16%, versus 71.51% for 2010.           ·     Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 9.45% at December 31, 2011, versus 8.39% at December 31, 2010.                 -     Elected to participate in the Treasury’s SBLF program by issuing $16.0 million of preferred stock, and simultaneously repurchased the $8.8 million of preferred stock sold to the Treasury in 2009 under the CPP.                 -     Repurchased warrants issued to the Treasury in 2009 under the CPP.   The following discussion and analysis of Salisbury’s consolidated results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010   Net Interest and Dividend Income   Net interest and dividend income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) increased $1,323,000 in 2011 over 2010. The net interest margin increased 14 basis points to 3.51% from 3.37%, due to a 46 basis points decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, offset in part by a 26 basis point decline in the average yield on interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is affected by changes in the mix of interest-earning assets and funding liabilities, asset and liability growth, and the effects of changes in market interest rates on the pricing and re-pricing of assets and liabilities. The following table sets forth the components of Salisbury’s net interest income and yields on average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funds.

The level of net interest income is a function of volume, rates and mix of both earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income can be adversely affected by changes in interest rate levels, changes in the volume of assets and liabilities that are subject to re-pricing within different future time periods, and in the level of non-performing assets.   Interest and Dividend Income   Tax equivalent interest and dividend income decreased $615,000, or 2.4%, to $25.1 million in 2011. Loan income increased $183,000, or 1.0%, primarily due to a $24.8 million, or 7.2%, increase in average loans, the benefit from which was substantially offset by a 32 basis point decline in average yield, due to lower market interest rates and their effect on new loan rates, loan re-pricing and loan re-financing activity in 2011.   Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities decreased $753,000, or 10.7%, in 2011, as a result of a $11.6 million decrease in average securities, and a 16 basis points decline in average yield, due to lower market interest rates and their effect on new bond yields, bond re-pricing and bond calls in 2011.   Interest from short term funds decreased $45,000 in 2011 as a result of a 17 basis points decline in average yield, offset in part by a $4.3 million increase in average short term funds.   Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased $1.9 million, or 25.9%, to $5.6 million in 2011 as a result of decreases in deposit rates and maturities of FHLBB advances, offset in part by higher average interest bearing deposits.   Interest on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $1,200,000, or 27.5%, in 2011, as a result a 39 basis point decline in average rate, to 0.83%, offset in part by a $23.7 million, or 6.6%, increase in average interest bearing deposits. The decline in average rate was due to the decline in interest rates and a changes in product mix, as the proportion represented by time deposits decreased to 29.15% from 38.34%, while non-maturity deposits increased to 70.85% from 61.66%.   Interest on retail repurchase agreements decreased $27,000, or 30.0%, as a result of a 21 basis point decline in average rate, to 0.50%, while the average balance was substantially unchanged.   Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $712,000, or 23.4%, due to a $17.8 million, or 23.7%, decrease in average advances as a result of scheduled maturities, while the average borrowing rate was substantially unchanged.       21     Table of Contents        Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses   The provision for loan losses was $1,440,000 for 2011, compared with $1,000,000 for 2010. Net loan charge-offs were $1,284,000 and $553,000, for the respective years. The increased provision for loan losses was necessitated by the increased net charge-offs of non-performing loans.

Furthermore, charge-offs in the future may not necessarily occur in these amounts or proportions.       22     Table of Contents            Years ended December 31,       2011         2010         2009         2008         2007       (dollars in thousands)(a)       Allowance         Loans         Allowance         Loans         Allowance         Loans         Allowance         Loans         Allowance         Loans       Residential       $ 1,097           52.47 %       $ 1,115           50.56 %       $ 488           50.91 %       $ 689           50.53 %       $ 515           50.97 %     Commercial         1,139           23.81           1,152           22.83           1,428           20.65           1,274           19.21           1,024           18.01       Construction, land &                                                                                                                             land development         409           4.75           400           7.39           233           8.61           281           12.88           118           12.59       Home equity credit         382           9.26           361           9.61           397           10.18           73           8.54           76           7.70       Real estate secured         3,027           90.30           3,028           90.39           2,546           90.35           2,317           91.16           1,733           89.27       Commercial & industrial         704           7.85           592           8.29           630           7.97           272           6.99           505           7.77       Consumer         79           1.20           164           1.32           117           1.38           97           1.85           201           2.96       Municipal         24           0.65           —           —           —           —           —           —           —           —       General unallocated         242           —           136           —           180           —           38           —           36           —       Total allowance       $ 4,076           100.00         $ 3,920           100.00         $ 3,473           100.00         $ 2,474           100.00         $ 2,475           100.00   (a) Percent of loans in each category to total loans.   The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the reporting date. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off, and is reduced by loan charge-offs. Loan charge-offs are recognized when management determines a loan or portion of a loan to be uncollectible. The allowance for loan losses is computed by segregating the portfolio into three components: (1) loans collectively evaluated for impairment: general loss allocation factors for non-impaired loans are segmented into pools of loans based on similar risk characteristics such as loan product, collateral type and loan-to-value, loan risk rating, historical loss experience, delinquency factors and other similar economic indicators, (2) loans individually evaluated for impairment: individual loss allocations for loans deemed to be impaired based on discounted cash flows or collateral value, and (3) unallocated: general loss allocations for other environmental factors.   Impaired loans and certain potential problem loans, where warranted, are individually evaluated for impairment. Impairment is measured for each individual loan, or for a borrower’s aggregate loan exposure, using either the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate. An allowance is established when the collateral value or discounted cash flows of the loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.   The component of the allowance for loan losses for loans collectively evaluated for impairment is estimated by stratifying loans into segments and credit risk ratings and applying management’s general loss allocation factors. The general loss allocation factors are based on expected loss experience adjusted for historical loss experience and other qualitative factors, including levels/trends in delinquencies; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience/ability/depth of lending management and staff; and national and local economic trends and conditions. The qualitative factors are determined based on the various risk characteristics of each loan segment. There were no significant changes in Salisbury’s policies or methodology pertaining to the general component of the allowance for loan losses during 2011.   The unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. It reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio.   Determining the adequacy of the allowance at any given period is difficult, particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods, and management must make estimates using assumptions and information that are often subjective and changing rapidly. The review of the loan portfolio is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment. Should the economic climate deteriorate, borrowers could experience difficulty and the level of non-performing loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require increased provisions. In management’s judgment, Salisbury remains adequately reserved both against total loans and non-performing loans at December 31, 2011.   Management’s loan risk rating assignments, loss percentages and specific reserves are subjected annually to an independent credit review by an external firm. In addition, the bank is examined annually on a rotational process by one of its two primary regulatory agencies, the FDIC and CTDOB. As an integral part of their examination process, the FDIC and CTDOB review the Bank’s credit risk ratings and allowance for loan losses. The Bank was examined by the FDIC in May 2011 and by the CTDOB in April 2010.       23     Table of Contents        Non-Interest Income   The following table details the principal categories of non-interest income.       Years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands)       2011         2010         2009         2011 vs. 2010         2010 vs. 2009       Trust and wealth advisory       $ 2,548         $ 2,102         $ 1,978         $ 446           21.2 %       $ 124           6.3 %     Service charges and fees         2,090           2,006           1,725           84           4.2           281           16.3       Gains on sales of mortgage loans, net         687           816           488           (129 )         (15.8 )         401           82.2       Mortgage servicing, net         65           97           80           (32 )         (33.0 )         (56 )         (70.0 )     Gains on securities, net         11           16           473           (5 )         (31.3 )         (457 )         (96.6 )     Other-than-temporary impairment losses         —           —           (1,128 )         —           —           1,128           100.0       Bank-owned life insurance         183           169           394           14           8.3           (225 )         (57.1 )     Other         72           101           65           (29 )         (28.7 )         36           55.4       Total non-interest income       $ 5,656         $ 5,307         $ 4,075         $ 349           6.6 %       $ 1,232           30.2 %   Non-interest income increased $349,000, or 6.56%, in 2011 versus 2010. Trust and Wealth Advisory revenues increased $446,000 due to growth in managed assets, higher asset valuations and increased estate fee income. Service charges and fees increased $84,000. Income from sales of mortgage loans decreased $129,000 due to lower volume of residential mortgage loan sales. Mortgage loans sales totaled $30.9 million in 2011 versus $42.7 million in 2010. Income from mortgage loan servicing of mortgage loans decreased $32,000 due primarily to higher mortgage rights amortization expense and lower credit enhancement fees, offset in part by higher servicing fees and a mortgage servicing valuation impairment benefit. Loans serviced for others totaled $114.8 million and $98.2 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Gains on securities represent the accretion of discounts on called securities. BOLI cash surrender value increased $14,000. Other income in 2010 included a $28,000 gain from the sale of real estate.   Non-Interest Expense   The following table details the principal categories of non-interest expense.       Years ended December 31, (dollars in thousands)       2011         2010         2009         2011 vs. 2010         2010 vs. 2009       Salaries       $ 6,970         $ 6,816         $ 6,623         $ 154           2.3 %       $ 193           2.9 %     Employee benefits         2,493           2,253           2,527           240           10.7           (274 )         (10.8 )     Premises and equipment         2,330           2,099           1,969           231           11.0           130           6.6       Data processing         1,410           1,452           1,473           (42 )         (2.9 )         (21 )         (1.4 )     Professional fees         1,099           1,364           1,493           (265 )         (19.4 )         (129 )         (8.6 )     Collections and OREO         590           191           45           399           208.9           146           324.4       FDIC assessment         596           735           914           (139 )         (18.9 )         (179 )         (19.6 )     Marketing and community contributions         343           319           341           24           7.5           (22 )         (6.5 )     Printing and stationery         215           276           298           (61 )         (22.1 )         (22 )         (7.4 )     Amortization of intangible assets         222           222           164           —           —           58           35.4       Other         1,371           1,386           1,659           (15 )         (1.1 )         (273 )         (16.5 )     Non-interest expense       $ 17,639         $ 17,113         $ 17,506         $ 526           3.1 %       $ (393 )         (2.3 )%   Non-interest expense in 2011 increased $526,000, or 3.1%, versus 2010. Salaries increased $154,000 due to changes in staffing levels and mix. Employee benefits increased $240,000 due to higher health and dental benefits expense, caused by year-over-year premium increases and higher staff utilization, and higher 401K Plan expense due to the implementation of a Safe Harbor Plan. The increases were offset in part by lower pension plan expense. Premises and equipment increased $231,000 due primarily to several facilities renovations, equipment replacement and the disposal of assets related to the reorganization of several Bank departments to gain efficiencies. Data processing decreased $42,000 mostly due to lower ATM processing fees in 2011 resulting from vendor rebates. Professional fees decreased $265,000 due to reduced spending on audit, consulting, legal and investment management services. Expenses related to collections and OREO increased $399,000. 2011 included $163,000 of OREO write-downs, OREO carrying costs, and collection related legal and appraisal services. FDIC insurance decreased $139,000 as the Bank benefited from the change in the assessment method. All other operating expenses decreased $52,000.   Income Taxes   The effective income tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 18.77% and 15.92%, respectively. Fluctuations in the effective tax rate result from changes in the mix of taxable and tax exempt income. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 34% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds and bank-owned life insurance. For further information on income taxes, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2011 or 2010, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of its utilization of Connecticut tax legislation that permits banks to shelter certain mortgage income from the Connecticut corporation business tax through the use of a special purpose entity called a PIC. In 2004 Salisbury availed of this legislation by forming a PIC, SBT Mortgage Service Corporation. Salisbury’s income tax provision reflects the full impact of the Connecticut legislation. Salisbury does not expect to pay other than minimum state income tax in the foreseeable future unless there is a change in Connecticut tax law.       24     Table of Contents        Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009   Net Interest and Dividend Income   Net interest and dividend income (presented on a tax-equivalent basis) increased $205,000 in 2010 over 2009 due primarily to a $25.4 million, or 5.0%, increase in average earning assets, facilitated by deposit growth, which more than offset a 14 basis point decrease in the net interest margin to 3.37% from 3.51%. The decrease in the net interest margin was mostly due to a 4 basis point decrease in the spread as asset yields declined more than funding rates. The net interest margin was also affected by changes in the mix of earning assets and funding liabilities, asset and liability growth, changes in market interest rates, and the impact of asset and liability re-pricing.   Interest Income   Tax equivalent interest and dividend income decreased $1,330,000, or 5.0%, to $25.7 million in 2010. Loan income increased $250,000, or 1.4%, primarily due to a $34.5 million, or 11.2%, increase in average loans, the impact of which was substantially offset by lower average yields, down 53 basis points. The decline in the average loan yield was caused by lower market interest rates in 2010 and their effect on loan re-pricing and loan re-financing activity. Tax equivalent interest and dividend income from securities decreased $1,638,000, or 18.9%, in 2010, as a result of lower yields due to portfolio re-pricing and changes in portfolio mix versus 2009, and a $10.9 million decrease in average volume. Income from short term funds increased $58,000 in 2010 as a result of higher yields, up 15 basis points, and a slight increase in the average balance, up $1.5 million.   Interest Expense   Interest expense decreased $1.5 million, or 17.0%, to $7.5 million in 2010 as a result of decreases in interest rates paid, offset in part by higher average interest bearing deposits. Interest on interest bearing deposit accounts decreased $1,426,000, or 24.6%, as a result of lower interest rates paid, offset in part by an increase in average balances and changes in product mix. Average interest-bearing deposits increased $27.8 million, or 8.4%, while their average rate decreased 54 basis points to 1.22%. Interest on retail repurchase agreements decreased $41,000, or 31.3%, as a result of lower interest rates paid, down 40 basis points, offset in part by an $0.8 million increase in average balances. Interest expense on FHLBB advances decreased $69,000 as a result of lower average borrowings, down $3.2 million, offset in part by a higher average borrowing rate, up 7 basis points, due to change in mix.   Provision and Allowance for Loan Losses   The provision for loan losses in 2010 was $1,000,000 compared with $985,000 in 2009, reflecting higher net loan charge-offs of $553,000 in 2010, compared with $236,000 in 2009. Reserve coverage at December 31, 2010, as measured by the ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans was up slightly, at 1.10%, as compared with 1.05% at December 31, 2009. Non-performing loans (non-accrual loans and accruing loans past-due 90 days or more) increased $2.7 million to $10.1 million, or 2.84% of gross loans receivable, at December 31, 2010, up from 2.25% at December 31, 2009, while accruing loans past due 30-89 days decreased $2.1 million to $1.9 million, or 0.54% of gross loans receivable.   Non-Interest Income   Non-interest income increased $1,232,000 in 2010 due to securities losses in 2009 and higher income in 2010 from sales and servicing of mortgage loans and service charges and fees. Salisbury did not sell any securities in 2010, compared with sales of $37.8 million in 2009. In June 2009, Salisbury recognized a $1,128,000 write-down for Other-Than–Temporary-Impairment (“OTTI”) on five non-agency issued Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (“CMO”) securities. Trust and wealth advisory fees grew slightly in 2010, due mostly to growth in managed assets. The increase in service charges and fees, of which $161,000 related to increased interchange fees, was mostly due to increased transactional activity related to deposit growth. Historically low borrowing rates in 2010 generated significant mortgage refinancing activity in the second half of 2010 that resulted in increased mortgage loan sales and related income. During 2010, Salisbury’s residential mortgage lending department originated and sold $42.7 million of residential mortgage loans, compared with $35.0 million during 2009. Loan servicing is retained on substantially all mortgage loans sold. The decrease in 2010 mortgage servicing income was due to higher mortgage servicing rights amortization expense resulting from increased loan refinancing activity. The decrease in income from bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) was to the inclusion in 2009 of benefits from a policy death settlement and a 1035 policy exchange, while income resulting from the increase in BOLI cash surrender value was substantially unchanged.   Non-Interest Expense   Non-interest expense decreased $393,000, or 2.3%, in 2010. Salaries increased in 2010 due to changes in staffing mix, head count and merit increases. The decrease in employee benefits expense resulted from a $530,000 decrease in pension expense, mostly due to the inclusion in 2009 of additional pension expense resulting from the former CEO’s early retirement, offset by increased medical insurance, 401(k) plan and BOLI expenses. Premises and equipment expense increased as a result of the opening of the Millerton, NY, office in January 2010 and the re-location of the Sheffield, MA, office in August 2010 to a larger facility. Professional fees for 2009 included, among other things, services related to the Bank’s participation in TARP and the acquisition of a branch office and related deposits and loans in Canaan, Connecticut. The decrease in FDIC insurance expense was due to a 2009 special assessment, offset in part by a higher 2010 assessment base from deposit growth. The increase in the amortization of core deposit intangibles was due to the December 2009 branch acquisition. Other expense includes postage, telephone, director fees, bank charges and various other deposit, loan and administrative related operating expenses.   Income Taxes   The effective income tax rates for 2010 and 2009 were 15.92%, and (2.04)%, respectively. Net income for 2009 included an income tax benefit of $49,000. Salisbury’s effective tax rate was less than the 34% federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, primarily from municipal bonds and bank-owned life insurance. Salisbury did not incur Connecticut income tax in 2010 or 2009, other than minimum state income tax, as a result of its utilization of a PIC.       25     Table of Contents        FINANCIAL CONDITION   Overview   During 2011, Salisbury’s assets grew $33.8 million to $609.3 million at December 31, 2011. Net loans receivable grew $18.3 million, or 5.20%, to $370.8 million. Asset growth was facilitated by deposit growth of $41.0 million, or 9.53%, to $471.3 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, Salisbury’s tangible book value per common share was $23.69 and Tier 1 leverage and total risk-based capital ratios were 9.45% and 15.97%, respectively. Both Salisbury and the Bank are categorized as “well capitalized”.   Securities and Short Term Funds   During 2011, securities increased $8.4 million to $161.9 million, while short-term funds (interest-bearing deposits with other banks) increased $6.8 million to $32.1 million as Salisbury increased its liquidity position in light of historically low interest rates and growth in volatile deposits.

As part of this process, Salisbury considers its intent to sell each debt security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, Salisbury recognizes an OTTI charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. For securities that meet neither of these conditions, an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for OTTI.   Salisbury does not intend to sell any of its securities and it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell any of its securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be maturity. Therefore, management does not consider any of its securities, other than four non-agency CMO securities reflecting OTTI, to be OTTI at December 31, 2011.   In 2009 Salisbury determined that five non-agency CMO securities reflected OTTI and recognized losses for deterioration in credit quality of $1,128,000. Salisbury judged the four remaining securities not to have additional OTTI and all other CMO securities not to be OTTI as of December 31, 2011. It is possible that future loss assumptions could change necessitating Salisbury to recognize future OTTI for further deterioration in credit quality. Salisbury does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that Salisbury will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis. The carrying value of such securities judged to be OTTI are as follows:       Available-for-Sale (dollars in thousands)       Par value         Carrying value         Fair value       Non-agency CMO                                         December 31, 2011       $ 5,158         $ 4,385         $ 4,144       December 31, 2010         5,846           4,768           4,378       December 31, 2009         6,890           5,583           4,409     Accumulated other comprehensive gain at December 31, 2011 included net unrealized holding gains, net of tax, of $1,353,000, a gain of $3,935,000 over December 31, 2010.   Loans   During 2011, net loans receivable increased $18.3 million, or 5.2%, to $370.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared with loan growth of $25.2 million, or 7.7% in 2010.   Salisbury’s retail lending department originates residential mortgage, home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans for the portfolio. During 2011, Salisbury originated $43.7 million of residential mortgage loans and $5.6 million of home equity loans for the portfolio, compared with $43.6 million and $8.1 million, respectively, in 2010. During 2011, total residential mortgage and home equity loans receivable grew by $10.9 million to $230.8 million at December 31, 2011, and represent 62% of loans receivable, substantially unchanged from 2010. During 2011, Salisbury’s residential mortgage lending department also originated and sold $30.9 million of residential mortgage loans, compared with $43.8 million during 2010. Substantially all loans sold were sold through the FHLBB Mortgage Partnership Finance Program with servicing retained by Salisbury. Consumer loans, amounting to $4.5 million at December 31, 2011, and representing 1.2% of loans receivable, remained substantially unchanged from 2010.       26     Table of Contents        Salisbury’s commercial lending department specializes in lending to small and mid-size companies, businesses and municipalities, and provides short-term and long-term financing, construction loans, commercial mortgages, equipment, working capital, property improvement loans and municipal financing. The department also works with both the SBA and USDA Government Guaranteed Lending Programs, however, such loans represent a very small percent of the commercial loan portfolio. During 2011, total commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and municipal loans increased $8.5 million to $120.8 million at December 31, 2011, and represent 32% of loans receivable, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2010.   The principal categories of loans receivable and loans held-for-sale are as follows:       Years ended December 31, (in thousands)       2011

Offsetting these deteriorations were loan risk rating upgrades resulting from improved performance, loan repayments, real estate acquired in settlement of loans and a loan restructured in 2010 whose designation as troubled debt restructured was removed due to satisfactory performance.   Salisbury has cooperative relationships with the vast majority of its non-performing loan customers. Substantially all non-performing loans are collateralized with real estate and the repayment of such loans is largely dependent on the return of such loans to performing status or the liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral. Salisbury pursues the resolution of all non-performing loans through collections, restructures, voluntary liquidation of collateral by the borrower and, where necessary, legal action. When attempts to work with a customer to return a loan to performing status, including restructuring the loan, are unsuccessful, Salisbury will initiate appropriate legal action seeking to acquire property by deed in lieu of foreclosure or through foreclosure, or to liquidate business assets.   Credit Quality Segments   Salisbury categorizes loans receivable into the following credit quality segments.             ·     Impaired loans consist of all non-accrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans, and represent loans for which it is probable that Salisbury will not be able to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreements.                             ·     Non-accrual loans, a sub-set of impaired loans, are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued because, in the opinion of management, full collection of principal or interest is unlikely.                             ·     Non-performing loans consist of non-accrual loans, and accruing loans past due 90 days and over that are well collateralized, in the process of collection and where full collection of principal and interest is assured. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans plus real estate acquired in settlement of loans.       28     Table of Contents                  ·     Troubled debt restructured loans are loans for which concessions such as reduction of interest rates, other than normal market rate adjustments, or deferral of principal or interest payments, extension of maturity dates, or reduction of principal balance or accrued interest, have been granted due to a borrower’s financial condition. Loan restructuring is employed when management believes the granting of a concession will increase the probability of the full or partial collection of principal and interest.                             ·     Potential problem loans consist of performing loans that have been assigned a substandard credit risk rating and that are not classified as impaired.   Credit Risk Ratings   Salisbury assigns credit risk ratings to loans receivable in order to manage credit risk and to determine the allowance for loan losses. Credit risk ratings categorize loans by common financial and structural characteristics that measure the credit strength of a borrower. Salisbury’s rating model has eight risk rating grades, with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of default. Grades 1 through 4 are pass ratings and 5 through 8 are ratings (special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss) defined by the bank’s regulatory agencies, the FDIC and CTDOB. Risk ratings are assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio and are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised, if needed, to reflect changes in the borrowers’ current financial position and outlook, risk profiles and the related collateral and structural positions.             ·     Loans risk rated as “special mention” possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management’s close attention that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loans at some future date.                             ·     Loans risk rated as “substandard” are loans where the Bank’s position is clearly not protected adequately by borrower current net worth or payment capacity. These loans have well defined weaknesses based on objective evidence and include loans where future losses to the Bank may result if deficiencies are not corrected, and loans where the primary source of repayment such as income is diminished and the Bank must rely on sale of collateral or other secondary sources of collection.                             ·     Loans risk rated as “doubtful” have the same weaknesses as substandard loans with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full, given current facts, conditions, and values, to be highly improbable. The possibility of loss is high, but due to certain important and reasonably specific pending factors, which may work to strengthen the loan, its reclassification as an estimated loss is deferred until its exact status can be determined.                             ·     Loans risk rated as “loss” are considered uncollectible and of such little value, that continuance as Bank assets is unwarranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather, it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless loan even though partial recovery may be made in the future.   Management actively reviews and tests its credit risk ratings against actual experience and engages an independent third-party to annually validate its assignment of credit risk ratings. In addition, the Bank’s loan portfolio and risk ratings are examined annually on a rotating basis by its two primary regulatory agencies, the FDIC and CTDOB.   Impaired Loans   Impaired loans decreased $2.7 million during 2011 to $12.7 million, or 3.39% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2011, from $15.4 million, or 4.32% of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2010.

Retail repurchase agreements decreased $1.0 million during 2011 to $12.1 million at December 31, 2011, compared with $13.2 million at December 31, 2010.   Deposit growth resulted primarily from an increase in deposit balances from a single relationship, the Bank’s largest, and which totals $47.3 million, or 10.05% of total deposits at December 31, 2011.   Salisbury has eight full-service offices located in Litchfield, Berkshire and Dutchess Counties in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York respectively. Scheduled maturities of time certificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 or more were as follows:       December 31, 2011 (in thousands)       Within  3 months         Within  3-6 months         Within  6-12 months         Over  1 year         Total       Certificates of deposit over $100,000       $ 6,973         $ 6,927         $ 7,792         $ 19,251         $ 40,943         31     Table of Contents        FHLBB advances decreased $18.2 million during 2011 to $54.6 million at December 31, 2011, compared with $72.8 million at December 31, 2010. The decreases were due to scheduled maturities and principal payments.   OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS   In the normal course of business, Salisbury enters into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 include operating leases, contractual purchases and certain pension and other benefit plans. For further discussion regarding operating leases see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The accompanying table summarizes Salisbury’s off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments and significant cash obligations, by remaining maturity, at December 31, 2011. Salisbury’s lending-related financial instruments include commitments that have maturities over one year. Contractual purchases include commitments for future cash expenditures, primarily for services and contracts that reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. Excluded from the following table are a number of obligations to be settled in cash, primarily in under one year. These obligations are reflected in Salisbury’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and include deposits, FHLBB advances and repurchase agreements that settle within standard market timeframes.       December 31, 2011 (in thousands) By Remaining Maturity       Within  1 year         Within  1-3 years         Within  4-5 years         After  5 years         Total       Residential       $ 5         $ 521         $ —         $ 1,033         $ 1,559       Home equity credit         1,693           149           1,163           27,924           30,929       Commercial         284           1,714           1,264           3,388           6,650       Land         290           —           —           —           290       Real estate secured         2,272           2,384           2,427           32,345           39,428       Commercial and industrial         849           2,204           436           8,226           11,715       Consumer         1,313           —           25           20           1,358       Unadvanced portions of loans         4,434           4,588           2,888           40,591           52,501       Commitments to originate loans         —           —           —           —           —       Standby letters of credit         34           —           —           —           34       Total       $ 4,468         $ 4,588         $ 2,888         $ 40,591         $ 52,535     LIQUIDITY   Salisbury manages its liquidity position to ensure it has sufficient funding availability at all times to meet both anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals, loan originations and advances, securities purchases and other operating cash outflows. Salisbury’s primary source of liquidity is deposits and though its preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low cost deposits, its ability to do so is affected by competitive interest rates and terms in its marketplace, and other financial market conditions. Other sources of funding include cash flows from loan and securities principal payments and maturities, funds provided by operations, and discretionary use of FHLBB advances. Liquidity can also be provided through sales of securities available-for-sale and loans.   Salisbury manages its liquidity in accordance with a liquidity funding policy, and also maintains a contingency funding plan that provide for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands for liquidity. At December 31, 2011, Salisbury’s liquidity ratio, as represented by cash, short term available-for-sale securities and marketable assets to net deposits and short term unsecured liabilities, was 33.70%, substantially unchanged from 28.4% at December 31, 2010. Management believes Salisbury’s funding sources will meet anticipated funding needs.   Operating activities for 2011 provided net cash of $6.8 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $23.2 million, principally for securities purchases of $45.8 million and net loan advances of $22.6 million, offset in part by securities repayments and maturities of $43.1 million and the maturity of an interest bearing time deposit with other banks of $5.0 million . Financing activities provided net cash of $26.5 million, principally, from net deposit and repurchase agreement growth of $40.0 million and proceeds from issuance of preferred stock of $16.0 million, offset in part by a net decrease in FHLBB advances of $18.2 million, redemption of preferred stock of $8.8 million and cash dividend payments, on common and preferred stock, of $2.3 million.   Operating activities for 2010 provided net cash of $5.5 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $29.8 million, principally for securities purchases of $52.9 million, net loan advances of $26.4 million, and capital expenditures of $2.9 million, offset in part by securities repayments and maturities of $53.0 million. Financing activities provided net cash of $8.0 million, principally, from net deposit and repurchase agreement growth of $13.9 million, offset in part by a net decrease in FHLBB advances of $3.6 million and cash dividend payments, on common and preferred stock, of $2.3 million.   Operating activities for 2009 provided net cash of $4.2 million. Investing activities utilized net cash of $27.7 million, principally for securities purchases of $110.7 million, net loan advances of $28.6 million, and capital expenditures of $3.6 million, offset in part by securities repayments, maturities and sales. Financing activities provided net cash of $57.2 million, principally, from net deposit growth of $61.8 million and from the issuance of Preferred Stock of $8.8 million, offset in part by a net decrease in FHLBB advances of $11.5 million and cash dividends paid.       32     Table of Contents        CAPITAL RESOURCES   Shareholders’ Equity   Shareholders’ equity increased $11.8 million in 2011 to $66.9 million at December 31, 2011. Book value and tangible book value per common share increased $2.75 and $2.89, respectively, to $30.12 and $23.69, respectively, compared with $27.37 and $20.81, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Contributing to the increase in shareholders’ equity for 2011 was net income of $4.1 million, other comprehensive gain of $3.1 million, preferred stock issuance to the Treasury of $16.0 million for SBLF participation, less the preferred stock and warrant repurchases from the Treasury of $8.8 million and $205,000, respectively, to exit CPP, and common stock issuance of $28,000, less common and preferred stock dividends and preferred stock accretion of $1.9 million, $446,000 and $78,000, respectively. Other comprehensive income included unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale, net of tax, of $3.9 million, offset in part by pension plan loss, net of tax, of $871,000. The increase in unrealized gains on securities available-for-sale and the pension plan liability resulted from the decline in market interest rates in 2011.   Preferred Stock   In August 2011, Salisbury issued to the Treasury $16 million of its Series B Preferred Stock under the SBLF program. The SBLF program is a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 to encourage lending to small businesses by providing Tier 1 capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion. The Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes and ranks senior to the Common Stock.   The Series B Preferred Stock pays noncumulative dividends. The dividend rate on the Series B Preferred Stock for the initial quarterly dividend period ended September 30, 2011 and each of the next nine quarterly dividend periods the Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding is determined each quarter based on the increase in the Bank’s Qualified Small Business Lending. The dividend rate for the initial and subsequent quarterly dividend period ended September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011, were 2.45100% and 1.55925%, respectively. For the tenth quarterly dividend period through four and one-half years after its issuance, the dividend rate on the Series B Preferred Stock will be fixed at the rate in effect at the end of the ninth quarterly dividend period and after four and one-half years from its issuance the dividend rate will be fixed at 9 percent per annum. On December 31, 2011, Salisbury declared a Series B Preferred Stock dividend of $63,756, payable on January 3, 2012. The Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting, other than voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the Series B Preferred Stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable at any time at one hundred percent of the issue price plus any accrued and unpaid dividends.   Simultaneously with the receipt of the SBLF capital, Salisbury repurchased for $8.8 million all of its Series A Preferred Stock sold to the Treasury in 2009 under the CPP, a part of TARP, and made a payment for accrued dividends. The transaction resulted in net capital proceeds to Salisbury of $7.2 million, of which Salisbury invested $6.5 million, or 90%, in the Bank as Tier 1 Capital.   As part of the CPP, Salisbury had issued to the Treasury a 10-year Warrant to purchase 57,671 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $22.93 per share. The Warrant was repurchased for $205,000 on November 2, 2011 and simultaneously cancelled.   Capital Requirements   Salisbury and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Under current regulatory definitions, Salisbury and the Bank are considered to be “well capitalized” for capital adequacy purposes. As a result, the Bank pays lower federal deposit insurance premiums than those banks that are not “well capitalized.” Salisbury and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios are as follows:               Well         December 31, 2011         December 31, 2010                 capitalized           Salisbury           Bank           Salisbury           Bank       Total Capital (to risk-weighted assets)         10.00 %         15.97 %         13.16 %         13.91 %         11.11 %     Tier 1 Capital (to risk-weighted assets)         6.00           14.88           12.08           12.84           10.06       Tier 1 Capital (to average assets)         5.00           9.45           7.77           8.39           6.72     A well-capitalized institution, which is the highest capital category for an institution as defined by the Prompt Corrective Action regulations issued by the FDIC and the FRB, is one which maintains a Total Risk-Based ratio of 10% or above, a Tier 1 Risk-Based ratio of 6% or above and a Leverage ratio of 5% or above, and is not subject to any written order, written agreement, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Maintaining strong capital is essential to Salisbury and the Bank’s safety and soundness. However, the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth, meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices.   Dividends   During 2011, Salisbury declared and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.28 per common share each quarter, totaling $1,891,000. The Board of Directors of Salisbury declared a common stock dividend of $0.28 per common share payable on February 24, 2012 to shareholders of record on February 10, 2012. Common stock dividends, when declared, will generally be paid the last business day of February, May, August and November, although Salisbury is not obligated to pay dividends on those dates or at any other time.       33     Table of Contents        During 2010, Salisbury declared three and paid four quarterly common stock dividends of $0.28 each totaling $1.9 million. In November 2009, Salisbury amended its dividend policy to coincide future quarterly common stock dividend declarations with quarterly earnings announcements made approximately four weeks after the end of future quarterly reporting periods. Prior to this amendment, dividend declarations were generally announced prior to the end of a reporting period. The timing of dividend payments remained substantially unchanged. Consequently, on February 4, 2010 Salisbury announced both its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 and its declaration on January 29, 2010 of a common stock dividend of $0.28 per common share, payable on February 26, 2010. For the corresponding prior year period, Salisbury announced a common stock dividend of $0.28 per common share on November 26, 2008, payable on January 31, 2009, and announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2008 on March 20, 2009.   During 2011 Salisbury declared Preferred Stock Series A and Series B dividends of $343,000 and $103,000, respectively, to the Treasury.   Salisbury’s ability to pay cash dividends is dependent on the Bank’s ability to pay cash dividends to Salisbury. There are certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends and other payments by the Bank to Salisbury. Under Connecticut law, the Bank cannot declare a cash dividend except from net profits, defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations. The total of all cash dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year shall not, unless specifically approved by the Banking Commissioner, exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years.   FRB Supervisory Letter SR 09-4, February 24, 2009, revised March 27, 2009, states that, as a general matter, the Board of Directors of a Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce dividends if (1) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (3) the BHC will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Moreover, a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the BHC capital position.   Salisbury believes that the payment of common stock cash dividends is appropriate, provided that such payment considers Salisbury’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition and does not adversely affect the financial stability of Salisbury or the Bank. The continued payment of common stock cash dividends by Salisbury will be dependent on Salisbury’s future core earnings, financial condition and capital needs, regulatory restrictions, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors of Salisbury.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on Salisbury’s financial statements.   IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES   Salisbury’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP that require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money, over time, due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of Salisbury are monetary and as a result, interest rates have a greater impact on Salisbury’s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation, although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. Although not a material factor in recent years, inflation could impact earnings in future periods.   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to such matters as:       (a)     assumptions concerning future economic and business conditions and their effect on the economy in general and on the markets in which Salisbury and the Bank do business; and     (b)     expectations for revenues and earnings for Salisbury and Bank.   Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions rather than historical or current facts and, therefore, are inherently uncertain and subject to risk. For those statements, Salisbury claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995.   Actual results could differ materially from management expectations, projections and estimates. Factors that could cause future results to vary from current management expectations include, but are not limited to, the following:       (a)     the risk of adverse changes in business conditions in the banking industry generally and in the specific markets in which the Bank operates;     (b)     changes in the legislative and regulatory environment that negatively impacts Salisbury and the Bank through increased operating expenses;     (c)     increased competition from other financial and non-financial institutions;     (d)     the impact of technological advances; and     (e)     other risks detailed from time to time in Salisbury’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Such developments could have an adverse impact on Salisbury’s and the Bank’s financial position and results of operations.   Item 7A.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS   Salisbury manages its exposure to interest rate risk through its Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) using risk limits and policy guidelines to manage assets and funding liabilities to produce financial results that are consistent with Salisbury’s liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability targets. Interest rate risk is the risk of loss to future earnings due to changes in interest rates.       34     Table of Contents        The ALCO manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in Salisbury’s financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income over a 24-month horizon. In management’s December 31, 2011 analysis, three of the simulations incorporate management’s growth assumptions over the simulation horizons, with allowances made for loan, deposit and security product mix shifts in selected interest rate scenarios, such as movements between lower rate savings and money market deposit accounts and higher rate time deposits, and changes in the reinvestment of loan and securities cash flows. The fourth simulation incorporates management’s balance sheet growth assumptions. Additionally, the simulations take into account the specific re-pricing, maturity and prepayment characteristics of differing financial instruments that may vary under different interest rate scenarios.   The ALCO reviews the simulation results to determine whether Salisbury’s exposure to change in net interest income remains within established tolerance levels over the simulation horizons and to develop appropriate strategies to manage this exposure. Salisbury’s tolerance levels for changes in net interest income in its income simulations varies depending on the magnitude of interest rate changes and level of risk-based capital. All changes are measured in comparison to the projected net interest income that would result from an “unchanged” rate scenario where interest rates remain stable over the forecast horizon. The ALCO also evaluates the directional trends of net interest income, net interest margin and other financial measures over the forecast horizon for consistency with its liquidity, capital adequacy, growth, risk and profitability targets.   ALCO uses four interest rate scenarios to evaluate interest risk exposure and may vary these interest rate scenarios to show the effect of steepening or flattening changes in yield curves as well as parallel changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2011 ALCO used the following interest rate scenarios: (1) unchanged interest rates; (2) immediately rising interest rates – immediate non-parallel upward shift in market interest rates ranging from 300 basis points for short term rates to 250 basis points for the 10-year Treasury; (3) immediately falling interest rates – immediate non-parallel downward shift in market interest rates ranging from 25 basis points for short term rates to 75 basis points for the 10-year Treasury; and (4) two step shock rising interest rates – ranging from 400 basis points for short term rates (200 basis points each year) to 305 basis points for the 10-year Treasury (175 basis points for year one and 130 basis points for year two). Deposit rates are assumed to shift by lesser amounts due to their relative historical insensitivity to market interest rate movements. Further, deposits are assumed to have certain minimum rate levels below which they will not fall. Income simulations do not reflect adjustments in strategy that the ALCO could implement in response to rate shifts.   As of December 31, 2011 net interest income simulations indicated that Salisbury’s exposure to changing interest rates over the simulation horizons remained within its tolerance levels. The following table sets forth the estimated change in net interest income from an unchanged interest rate scenario over the periods indicated for changes in market interest rates using Salisbury’s financial instruments as of December 31, 2011.       December 31, 2011 (in thousands)       Months 1-12       Months 13-24     Immediately rising interest rates (management’s growth assumptions)         (12.87 )%         (8.85 )%     Immediately falling interest rates (management’s growth assumptions)         (0.35 )         (2.03 )     Gradually rising interest rates (management’s growth assumptions)         (7.56 )         (14.81 )   The negative exposure of net interest income to immediately and gradually rising rates as compared to the unchanged rate scenario results from a faster projected rise in the cost of funds versus income from earning assets, as relatively rate-sensitive money market and time deposits re-price faster than longer duration earning assets. The negative exposure of net interest income to immediately falling rates as compared to an unchanged rate scenario results from a greater decline in earning asset yields compared to rates paid on funding liabilities, as a result of faster prepayments on existing assets and lower reinvestment rates on future loans originated and securities purchased.   While the ALCO reviews simulation assumptions and back-tests simulation results to ensure that they are reasonable and current, income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk or future net interest margin. Over time, the re-pricing, maturity and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments and the composition of Salisbury’s balance sheet may change to a different degree than estimated. Simulation modeling assumes Salisbury’s expectation for future balance sheet growth, which is a function of the business environment and customer behavior. Another significant simulation assumption is the sensitivity of core savings deposits to fluctuations in interest rates. Income simulation results assume that changes in both core savings deposit rates and balances are related to changes in short-term interest rates. The assumed relationship between short-term interest rate changes and core deposit rate and balance changes used in income simulation may differ from the ALCO’s estimates. Lastly, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans involve a level of risk that unforeseen changes in prepayment speeds may cause related cash flows to vary significantly in differing rate environments. Such changes could affect the level of reinvestment risk associated with cash flow from these instruments, as well as their market value. Changes in prepayment speeds could also increase or decrease the amortization of premium or accretion of discounts related to such instruments, thereby affecting interest income.       35     Table of Contents        Salisbury also monitors the potential change in market value of its available-for-sale debt securities in changing interest rate environments. The purpose is to determine market value exposure that may not be captured by income simulation, but which might result in changes to Salisbury’s capital and liquidity position. Results are calculated using industry-standard analytical techniques and securities data. Available-for-sale equity securities are excluded from this analysis because the market value of such securities cannot be directly correlated with changes in interest rates. The following table summarizes the potential change in market value of available-for-sale debt securities resulting from immediate parallel rate shifts:       December 31, 2011 (in thousands)       Rates up 100bp         Rates up 200bp       U.S. Treasury notes       $ (244 )       $ (475 )     U.S. Government agency notes         (270 )         (594 )     Municipal bonds         (2,738 )         (6,364 )     Mortgage backed securities         (1,874 )         (4,174 )     Collateralized mortgage obligations         (739 )         (1,453 )     SBA pools         (11 )         (21 )     Other         —           —       Total available-for-sale debt securities       $ (5,873 )       $ (13,081 )       36     Table of Contents        		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk           65 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following discussion and analysis represents management’s view of the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial schedules included in this annual report. The financial condition and results of operations presented are not indicative of future performance.   Results of Operations   Overview   The Corporation recorded net income of $7,148,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011, a 12.7% increase over the $6,345,000 earned during the same period in 2010. The 2010 net income was 47.6% higher than the 2009 net income of $4,300,000. Earnings per share, basic and diluted, were $2.50 for 2011, compared to $2.23 in 2010, and $1.52 in 2009.   Despite significant economic weakness and an extremely low interest rate environment, the Corporation’s net interest income increased at a rate of 3.5%, or $780,000, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 5.8%, or a $1,222,000 increase, from 2009 to 2010. Other income, excluding the gain or loss on securities, decreased 6.8%, or $406,000 in 2011, compared to 2010. Total operational costs increased minimally by $103,000, or 0.5%, from 2010 to 2011.   The financial services industry uses two primary performance measurements to gauge performance: return on average assets (ROA) and return on average equity (ROE). ROA measures how efficiently a bank generates income based on the amount of assets or size of a company. ROE measures the efficiency of a company in generating income based on the amount of equity or capital utilized. The latter measurement typically receives more attention from shareholders. The Corporation’s 2011 ROA was 0.95%, compared to 0.85% in 2010; likewise ROE increased from 8.62% in 2010 to 9.22% in 2011. Both increases were primarily due to the increase in the Corporation’s earnings. The 11.8% increase in ROA was slightly lower than the 12.7% increase in earnings due to a 1.2% growth in the Corporation’s average assets. The ROE increased 7.0%, as the 12.7% increase in earnings was partially offset by a 5.4% increase in average equity. This resulted in more return from the equity utilized.       Key Ratios       Year Ended               December 31,               2011         2010       Return on Average Assets         0.95 %         0.85 %     Return on Average Equity         9.22 %         8.62 %   The results of the Corporation’s operations are best explained by addressing in further detail the five major sections of the income statement, which are as follows:             ·     Net interest income           ·     Provision for loan losses           ·     Other income           ·     Operating expenses           ·     Income taxes   The following discussion analyzes each of these five components.   Net Interest Income   Net interest income (NII) represents the largest portion of the Corporation’s operating income. In 2011, NII generated 76.4% of the Corporation’s gross revenue stream, compared to 76.1% in 2010, and 76.5% in 2009. Since NII comprises a significant portion of the operating income, the direction and rate of increase or decrease will often indicate the overall performance of the Corporation.   The following table shows a summary analysis of NII on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis. For analytical purposes and throughout this discussion, yields, rates, and measurements such as NII, net interest spread, and net yield on interest earning assets, are presented on an FTE basis. This differs from the NII reflected on the Corporation’s     31     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis         Statements of Income, where the NII is simply the interest earned on loans and securities less the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. By calculating the NII on an FTE basis, the added benefit of having tax-free loans and securities is factored in to more accurately represent what the Corporation earns through the NII. The FTE adjustment shows the benefit these loans and securities bring in a dollar amount because the Corporation does not pay tax on the income they generate. As a result, the FTE NII shown in both tables below will exceed the NII reported on the statements of income. The amount of FTE adjustment totaled $2,113,000 for 2011, $1,999,000 for 2010, and $1,746,000 for 2009.   The amount of the tax adjustment varies depending on the amount of income earned on tax-free assets. The Corporation has historically carried a larger component of tax-free loans and securities relative to its size. When income levels were diminished in 2006 through 2009, this caused the Corporation to be in an alternative minimum tax (AMT) position, as tax-free income grew to a larger percentage of total income. When the Corporation was in an AMT position, tax-free loans and securities did not offer the full tax advantage they do when the Corporation is not subject to AMT. Because of the AMT position, management began reducing the tax-free municipal bond portfolio in 2008 and early 2009 in an effort to reduce the Corporation’s AMT position, which acted to reduce the tax-equivalent adjustments. However, because of legislation that followed the credit crisis in the fall of 2008, beginning in 2009, financial institutions were permitted to purchase 2009 and 2010 newly issued tax-free municipal bonds, which are AMT-exempt for the life of the bond. As a result, management resumed the purchase of AMT-exempt municipal bonds in mid-2009 increasing the size of the tax-free municipal bond portfolio, and again increasing the tax equivalent adjustment. This is why the tax equivalent adjustment increased from 2009 to 2010 and again from 2010 to 2011. The Corporation was not in an AMT position for 2011 due to higher levels of taxable income and it is not expected to be in an AMT position in 2012, therefore it is likely that the Corporation’s tax-equivalent adjustment will continue to grow slowly in 2012.       Net Interest Income       (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                   Year ended               2011         2010         2009               $         $         $       Total interest income         31,233           32,754           33,803       Total interest expense         8,246           10,547           12,818       Net interest income         22,987           22,207           20,985       Tax equivalent adjustment         2,113           1,999           1,746       Net interest income                                         (fully taxable equivalent)         25,100           24,206           22,731     NII is the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense incurred on liabilities. Accordingly, two factors affect NII:             ·     The rates charged on interestearning assets and paid on     interest bearing liabilities           ·     The average balance of interestearning assets and interest bearing     liabilities   The Federal funds rate, the Prime rate, the shape of the U.S. Treasury curve and other wholesale funding curves, all affect NII.   The Federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate that financial institutions charge other financial institutions to buy or sell overnight funds, declined from 5.25% in August 2007, to 0.25% by December 15, 2008, and has remained at this historically low level to the date of this filing. The Prime rate typically moves in tandem with the Federal funds rate and similarly has not moved from its historically low 3.25% since December 31, 2008.   The fact that the Federal funds rate and the Prime rate have remained at these very low levels for over two years has generally had offsetting positive and negative impacts to the Corporation’s NII. The decrease in the Federal funds rate has reduced the cost of funds on overnight borrowings and allowed lower interest rates paid on deposits, reducing the Corporation’s interest expense, while the decrease in the Prime rate has reduced the yield on the Corporation’s Prime-based loans. The Corporation’s fixed rate loans do not reprice as rates change; however, with the steep decline in interest rates and a prolonged period with lower market rates, more customers have refinanced into lower fixed rate       32     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis         loans or moved into Prime-based loans. Management has instituted floors on certain loan instruments and revised pricing standards to help slow the reduction of loan yield during this historically low-rate period.   Short-term interest rates have decreased significantly over the past three years as a result of the economic crisis. The U.S. Treasury curve has maintained some positive slope with overnight rates close to 0.25% and the 10-year U.S. Treasury close to 2.00%. The positive slope of the yield curve has fluctuated many times in the past two years with the overnight rates remaining the same, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury varying between as high as 4.01% in 2010 and 3.75% in 2011, and as low as 2.41% in 2010, and 1.72% in 2011. The 10-year U.S. Treasury finished 2011 at 1.89%, which provided for only 164 basis points of slope off the overnight rate of 0.25%. Generally, there was a little more positive slope in the yield curve during 2010 than in 2011. The average 10-year U.S. Treasury close was approximately 2.78% in 2011 versus 3.21% in 2010. The weakening in the slope of the yield curve has made it challenging for management to invest excess liquidity in investments with attractive yields. However, since deposits and borrowings generally price off short-term rates, the significant rate drops on the short end of the rate curve permitted management to continue to reduce the overall cost of funds during 2011. Over this period, management continued to reprice time deposits and borrowings to lower levels. Rates on interest bearing core deposit accounts were also reduced during 2011.   Management currently anticipates that the overnight interest rate and Prime rate will remain at these historically low levels throughout 2012 because of the current economic and credit situation. This will likely result in the U.S. Treasury curve retaining a positive slope for 2012, based on the economic data currently available. This will allow management to continue to price the vast majority of liabilities off lower short-term rates, while pricing loans and investing in longer securities, which are based off the 5-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates that are above short-term rates.       33     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        The following table provides an analysis of year-to-year changes in net interest income by distinguishing what changes were a result of average balance increases or decreases and what changes were a result of interest rate increases or decreases.       RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME       (TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS, DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                                 2011 vs. 2010         2010 vs. 2009               Increase (Decrease)         Increase (Decrease)               Due To Change In         Due To Change In                                   Net                             Net               Average         Interest         Increase         Average         Interest         Increase               Balances         Rates         (Decrease)         Balances         Rates         (Decrease)               $         $         $         $         $         $       INTEREST INCOME                                                                             Federal funds sold         (4 )         (4 )         (8 )         4           1           5       Interest on deposits at other banks         24           12           36           5           3           8       Securities available for sale:                                                                             Taxable         293           (1,390 )         (1,097 )         (15 )         (1,294 )         (1,309 )     Tax-exempt         687           132           819           780           (143 )         637       Total securities         980           (1,258 )         (278 )         765           (1,437 )         (672 )     Loans         (737 )         (420 )         (1,157 )         513           (649 )         (136 )     Regulatory stock         (1 )         1           —           —           (1 )         (1 )     Total interest income         262           (1,669 )         (1,407 )         1,287           (2,083 )         (796 )                                                                                   INTEREST EXPENSE                                                                             Deposits:                                                                             Demand deposits         40           (104 )         (64 )         68           (243 )         (175 )     Savings deposits         9           (16 )         (7 )         18           (74 )         (56 )     Time deposits         (548 )         (1,369 )         (1,917 )         264           (1,786 )         (1,522 )     Total deposits         (499 )         (1,489 )         (1,988 )         350           (2,103 )         (1,753 )                                                                                   Borrowings:                                                                             Federal funds purchased         (1 )         —           (1 )         (10 )         (6 )         (16 )     Other borrowings         (11 )         (301 )         (312 )         (388 )         (114 )         (502 )     Total borrowings         (12 )         (301 )         (313 )         (398 )         (120 )         (518 )     Total interest expense         (511 )         (1,790 )         (2,301 )         (48 )         (2,223 )         (2,271 )     NET INTEREST INCOME         773           121           894           1,335           140           1,475     In 2011, the Corporation’s NII on an FTE basis increased by $894,000 compared to 2010, a 3.7% increase. Total interest income on an FTE basis for 2011 decreased $1,407,000, or 4.0%, from 2010, while interest expense decreased $2,301,000, or 21.8%, from 2010 to 2011. The FTE interest income from the securities portfolio decreased by $278,000, or 2.4%, while loan interest income declined $1,157,000, or 5.0%. During 2011, loan demand was low and the Corporation used available liquidity generated by deposits and additional borrowings to invest in securities. Although the growth in the securities portfolio added $980,000 to net interest income, the lower yields on securities caused a $1,258,000 reduction, resulting in a net decrease of $278,000. Slow loan growth and a decline in overall loan balances throughout the year resulted in a decrease in interest income of $737,000. Decreases in loan yield reduced interest income by an additional $420,000, resulting in an overall decrease of $1,157,000.   Interest bearing liabilities declined throughout 2011. Lower balances, primarily in time deposits, resulted in savings of $499,000 on deposit costs in total. Lower interest rates on all deposit groups caused $1,489,000 of savings, resulting in net savings of $1,988,000. Out of all the Corporation’s deposit types, demand deposits reprice the most rapidly, as nearly all accounts are immediately affected by rate changes. The Corporation reduced demand deposit interest expense by $104,000 due to lower rates. Time deposit balances decreased resulting in a $548,000 reduction to expense, and time deposits repricing to lower interest rates reduced interest expense by an additional $1,369,000, causing a net reduction of $1,917,000 in time deposit interest expense. Historically, the Corporation has seen increases in time deposits when the equity markets decline, as investors attempt to protect principal. This occurred in     34     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis         2010; however, 2011 brought about lower time deposit balances. Even with the historically low rate environment, the Corporation was successful in increasing balances of other deposit types by providing competitive rates. As 2011 progressed and interest rates remained low, the Corporation was able to continue to reprice time deposits maturing at lower interest rates thereby reducing the cost of funds significantly. Management was also able to reduce interest rates throughout the year on the other interest bearing core deposit balances.   The average balance of outstanding borrowings remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011. The very slight decline in total borrowings decreased interest expense by $12,000. The decline in interest rates decreased interest expense by $301,000 as long-term borrowings matured at high rates and were refinanced at much lower rates. The aggregate of these amounts was a decrease in interest expense of $313,000 related to total borrowings.   The following table shows a more detailed analysis of net interest income on an FTE basis shown with all the major elements of the Corporation’s balance sheet, which consists of interest earning and non-interest earning assets and interest bearing and non-interest bearing liabilities. Additionally, the analysis provides the net interest spread and the net yield on interest earning assets. The net interest spread is the difference between the yield on interestearning assets and the interest rate paid on interestbearing liabilities. The net interest spread has the deficiency of not giving credit for the non-interest bearing funds and capital used to fund a portion of the total interestearning assets. For this reason, Management emphasizes the net yield on interestearning assets, also referred to as the net interest margin (NIM). The NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income on an FTE basis into total average interestearning assets. The NIM is generally the benchmark used by analysts to measure how efficiently a bank generates NII. For example, a financial institution with a NIM of 3.50% would be able to use fewer assets and still achieve the same level of NII as a financial institution with a NIM of 3.25%.       35     Table of

The yield earned on assets dropped 30 basis points while the rate paid on liabilities dropped 41 basis points. Management anticipates NIM stabilization or slight improvement in 2012 as the rate curve remains in a positive slope, allowing further cost savings to occur on liabilities, while loans have essentially reached the bottom of the pricing cycle. Prime rate decreases that have a negative impact to loan yield should be over now that the target Federal funds rate is between 0.00% and 0.25%. While the amount of the Corporation’s Prime-based loans continues to increase, management is also flooring more Prime-based loans above 3.25% in an effort to slow the loss of loan yield. Management is also taking action to increase Prime-based loan rates when the customer’s credit standing has diminished. Management’s efforts to price Prime-based loans higher were mainly offset by more Prime-based loan demand. Customers are seeking more Prime-based loans because even with Prime floors instituted at 4.00%, these variable rate loans are viewed as more desirable than commercial fixed rate loans that range from just under 5.00% to over 7.00%, depending on the term and credit quality of the borrower. Some business and commercial borrowers are paying down these fixed rate loans, and refinancing with a Prime-based variable rate loan. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) carefully monitors the NIM because it indicates trends in net interest income, the Corporation’s largest source of revenue. For more information on the plans and strategies in place to protect the NIM and moderate the impact of rising rates, please refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   Yields on the Corporation’s securities declined 42 basis points for the year 2011, compared to 2010. This compares to a 52 basis point decline in securities yield that occurred from 2009 to 2010. Beginning in 2009, most reinvestment of securities has occurred at lower interest rates, causing lower portfolio return. During 2010 and 2011, most of the cash flow received from the securities portfolio was reinvested at significantly lower yields. The portfolio yield did not decline to the extent that market rates had declined in 2009, due mainly to the length of the Corporation’s portfolio, some market changes, and certain portfolio strategies. In 2009, due to continued turmoil in the credit markets, there were opportunities to purchase instruments that carried larger-than-normal spreads. This was especially true with regard to corporate bonds. The resumption of purchasing tax-exempt municipal bonds that qualify as alternative minimum tax exempt also helped to keep the decline in security yield to a minimum. However, as the period of historically low rates grew longer, more and more of the Corporation’s securities matured and had to be invested at lower rates. With relatively low loan demand in 2009, 2010, and an actual reduction of loans in 2011, management had to direct all cash flows from securities back into securities. The low point in reinvestment at lower rates was in September 2011 when the 10-year U.S. Treasury was as low as 1.72%. The 10-year yield was 3.30% as of December 31, 2010, and had risen as high as 3.75% in February 2011, but steadily declined after that, finishing 2011 at 1.89%. The end of 2011, and the beginning of 2012, has brought lower longer-term U.S. Treasury rates and with them, fewer opportunities to reinvest at higher interest rates. Management anticipates that the U.S. Treasury rates will remain low in 2012 with normal cyclical fluctuations, but no material changes in the curve. Loan yield will likely retreat further as new loan volume and refinancing to Prime-based variable loans will likely continue, and security yield will also likely decline, with a less favorable slope to the yield curve with little slope between the short end and long end of the curve.   The rate paid on deposits and borrowings decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011, from the same period in 2010. Management follows a disciplined pricing strategy on core deposit products that are not rate sensitive, meaning that the balances do not fluctuate significantly when interest rates change. The pricing strategy helped to manage the cost of funds by reducing interest expense on demand deposits by 9 basis points, on savings deposits by 2 basis points, and on time deposits by 55 basis points in 2011. Management captured rate savings on time deposits as large portions of the time deposit portfolio repriced downward as interest rates declined. Typically, the Corporation sees increases in time deposits during periods when consumers are not confident in the stock market and economic conditions deteriorate. During these periods, there is a “flight to safety” to federally insured deposits. This trend occurred in 2009 and 2010, but time deposit balances declined throughout 2011. In previous years, the Corporation benefited from the fallout related to any local merger activity but that subsided in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009. A newer trend affecting deposit growth is customers’ concern about the financial health of their financial institution, which supersedes their interest in obtaining the best market interest rates. This trend benefits the Corporation due to its stronger capital and better earnings performance than several local competitors.   The average rate on borrowed funds decreased by 36 basis points from 2010 to 2011, as several long-term borrowings matured and management was able to refinance into new long-term borrowings at significantly lower interest rates. Throughout most of 2011, the fixed borrowing rates were lower than the average rate paid on the Corporation’s existing borrowings. The Corporation will have opportunities to decrease borrowing costs further in 2012, as additional fixed rate borrowings mature or reprice and new advances are obtained at lower rates.     37     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Provision for Loan Losses   The allowance for loan losses provides for losses inherent in the loan portfolio as determined by a quarterly analysis and calculation of various factors related to the loan portfolio. The amount of the provision reflects the adjustment that management determines is necessary to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The Corporation added $1,575,000 to the allowance for 2011, compared to $1,800,000 for 2010. The Corporation gives special attention to the level of delinquent loans. The analysis of the loan loss allowance takes into consideration, among other things, the following factors:             ·     levels and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals, and charge-offs,           ·     trends within the loan portfolio,           ·     changes in lending policies and procedures,           ·     experience of lending personnel and management oversight,           ·     national and local economic trends,           ·     concentrations of credit,           ·     external factors such as legal and regulatory requirements,           ·     changes in the quality of loan review and Board oversight,           ·     changes in the value of underlying collateral.   The provision for the year ended December 31, 2011, was lower than the provision for 2010 due to the following factors:             ·     Lower levels of delinquent and non-performing loans           ·     Lower balances of classified loans           ·     Decreased charge-offs           ·     Increased allowance as a percentage of total loans   While the provision was lower in 2011 than it was in 2010, it is still at an elevated level compared to years prior to 2008. The factors listed above continue to adversely affect the Corporation’s loan portfolio and, consequently, the provision. The first three factors are all related to the difficult economic conditions, which have prevailed in 2010 and 2011. The cumulative impact of prolonged recessionary conditions has had an impact on the Corporation’s borrowers, primarily commercial and business borrowers, making it necessary to increase the allowance as a percentage of loans to provide for higher anticipated losses. Because of the elevated provision, the allowance as a percentage of loans increased from 1.72% at December 31, 2010, to 2.06% by the end of 2011. Total charge-offs for 2011 amounted to $463,000, compared to $670,000 in 2010. Because of the lower charge-off levels and the improved performance of the loan portfolio, the provision expense was reduced in the fourth quarter of 2011 resulting in the decrease of $225,000 in the provision expense from 2010 to 2011. It is anticipated that the Corporation will make smaller provision allocations in 2012, as a result of the improved performance of the loan portfolio, including lower charge-offs, lower delinquencies and non-performing loans, and a reduction in classified loan balances.   Management also continues to provide for estimated losses on pools of similar loans based on historical loss experience. Management utilizes qualitative factors every quarter designed to adjust historical loss experience to take into consideration the current trends in loan volume, delinquencies, changes in lending practices, and the quality of the Corporation’s underwriting, credit analysis, lending staff, and Board oversight. Additionally, national and local economic trends and conditions are considered to help determine the impact on the amount of loan loss allowance the Corporation should be carrying on the various types of loans. In 2011, the Corporation adjusted several qualitative factors, primarily those related to agricultural lending. Most of these qualitative factors were adjusted higher to account for the increased activity in the agriculture lending area and the increased risk associated with this higher volume. The periodic adjustment of qualitative factors allows the Corporation’s historical loss experience to be continually updated to more accurately project estimated credit losses.   Management continues to evaluate the allowance for loan losses in relation to the growth or decline of the loan portfolio and its associated credit risk, and believes the provision and the allowance for loan losses are adequate to provide for future loan losses.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, $1,500,000 of gains on securities transactions were recorded compared to $972,000 for 2010. Gains or losses on securities transactions fluctuate based on market conditions including:             ·     opportunities to reposition the securities portfolio to improve long-term earnings,           ·     appreciation or deterioration of a securities value due to changes in interest rates, credit risk, or market dynamics such as spread and liquidity, or           ·     management’s asset liability goals to improve liquidity or reduce interest rate or fair value risk.   The gains or losses recorded depend entirely on management’s active trades based on the above. Losses can be in the form of active sales of securities, or impairment of securities, which involves writing the security down to a lower value based on anticipated credit losses. During 2010, management was able to take advantage of favorable market conditions and sell a number of securities for net gains of $1,365,000, offsetting $393,000 of impairment charges for the year and resulting in net securities gains of $972,000. In 2011, net security gains amounted to $1,824,000, offsetting $324,000 of impairment charges for the year resulting in net securities gains of $1,500,000.   Trust and investment services income increased 0.3% from 2010 to 2011, after increasing 4.4% from 2009 to 2010. In 2011, trust and investment services revenue accounted for 3.7% of the Corporation’s gross revenue stream, including gains and losses on securities and mortgages, compared to 3.8% in 2010, and 3.9% in 2009. Trust and investment services revenue consists of income from traditional trust services and income from alternative investment services provided through a third party. In 2011, the traditional trust business accounted for $805,000, or 71.6%, of total trust and investment services income, with the alternative investment services totaling $320,000, or 28.4%. In 2011, traditional trust services income decreased $15,000, or 1.8%, from 2010 levels, while alternative investment services income increased $18,000, or 6.0%, over 2010 levels. The amount of customer investment activity drives the investment services income. In 2009, the economic slowdown throughout the year had diminished customer interest in investing in the equity market, but activity picked up marginally in 2010 and 2011 as some confidence in the market was restored. The trust and investment services area continues to be an area of strategic focus for the Corporation. Management believes there is a great need for retirement, estate, and small business planning in the Corporation’s service area. Management also sees these services as being a necessary part of a comprehensive line of financial solutions across the organization.   Service charges on deposit accounts for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $279,000, or 17.6%, compared to 2010. Overdraft service charges for 2011, which comprise approximately 87% of the total deposit service charges, decreased to $1,130,000, from $1,408,000 in 2010, a 19.7% decrease. This notable decrease was a result of regulatory changes implemented in mid-2010 which prevented all financial institutions from charging overdraft fees       39     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        on one-time debit card transactions or point of sale transactions unless a customer chooses to allow these types of overdrafts to occur. Management expects overdraft income to remain relatively stable throughout 2012 because the regulatory changes have been in full effect for over a year and customer activity has settled into these new regulatory practices.   Other fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011, by $18,000, or 3.7%, compared to the previous year. Loan-related fees decreased $21,000, while the remaining fee income categories increased $3,000. Thirty-year mortgage origination fees declined $24,000, or 38.9%, as mortgage activity declined due to the extended low-rate environment. Combined mortgage rate amendments, modifications, and document preparation fees increased by $8,000, or 8.7%, from 2010 to 2011, as the number of rate amendments and modifications increased from 2010. The Corporation assesses fees to business customers when they amend the original terms of their mortgage agreement, to change the length of the loan, the rate, or both. These amendments allow customers to obtain favorable terms without rewriting the loan. These loan amendments do not involve delinquent loans. Wire transfer fees increased $8,000, or 20.5%, while ATM surcharge fees decreased by $13,000, or 14.5%, from 2010 to 2011.   The largest component of commission income is from the Corporation’s Debit MasterCard®. The amount of customer usage of the card at point of sale transactions determines the level of commission income received. The debit card income of $1,609,000 in 2011 represents an increase of $243,000, or 17.8%, over 2010. Customers have become more comfortable with the use of debit cards, and they are now widely accepted by merchants, thereby increasing the number of transactions processed. This type of commission income is also referred to as interchange fee income. The Debit MasterCard income has consistently increased by double-digit percentages over the past five years; however, presently there is interchange fee legislation that would limit the amount of income financial institutions would receive from these debit card transactions. Management is unable to predict the outcome of the projected legislation, but it is likely that a reduction could begin to occur on this revenue in 2012. Another large component of commission income is from MasterCard and Visa® commissions, which provided income of $184,000 for 2011, an increase of $22,000, or 13.6%, over 2010. MasterCard and Visa commissions are the amount the Corporation earns on transactions processed through the MasterCard and Visa systems for business customers.   Gains on the sale of loans in 2011 decreased $118,000, or 38.7%, from 2010. Although economic conditions have slowed the sale of homes and new construction, the amount of refinancing activity increased significantly in 2010 because of the historically low interest rate environment and the desire of borrowers to reduce their total debt service cost. This environment increased the amount of mortgages originated for sale to the secondary market and this activity drives the gains on the sale of loans. During 2011, this refinancing activity slowed down as mortgage rates have now been lower for an extended period of time.   Losses on the sale of loans amounted to $263,000 for 2011 with no corresponding loss in the prior year. This loss was due to the sale of the Corporation’s student loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2011. The student loan portfolio was sold because the outstanding loan balances of approximately $8 million had ceased to provide a positive yield to the Corporation after all expenses.   The earnings on BOLI increased $19,000, or 3.4%, for 2011, compared to 2010. Management did not make any BOLI purchases in 2011; therefore, the increase in BOLI income generally resulted from increases in the cash surrender value. Increases in cash surrender value are a function of the return of the policy net of all expenses. Benefits paid upon death that exceed the policy’s cash surrender value are recorded as miscellaneous income. No BOLI death benefits were received in 2011 or 2010.   The miscellaneous income category decreased $2,000, or 0.6%, for 2011, in comparison to 2010. Income related to adjusting the provision for off-balance sheet credit losses increased $8,000 from 2010 to 2011, and income from sales tax refunds decreased by $20,000 for the same period. Gains from the sale of furniture and equipment were $10,000 in 2011 with no corresponding income in 2010.       40     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Operating Expenses   The following table provides details of the Corporation’s operating expenses for the last three years along with the percentage increase or decrease for 2011 and 2010 compared to the previous year.       OPERATING EXPENSES     (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             2011 vs. 2010         2010 vs. 2009               2011         2010         Increase (Decrease)         2010         2009         Increase (Decrease)               $         $         $         %         $         $                   %                                                                                             Salaries and employee benefits         11,501           10,834           667           6.2           10,834           10,867           (33 )         (0.3 )     Occupancy expenses         1,648           1,657           (9 )         (0.5 )         1,657           1,440           217           15.1       Equipment expenses         798           819           (21 )         (2.6 )         819           820           (1 )         (0.1 )     Advertising & marketing expenses         362           445           (83 )         (18.7 )         445           387           58           15.0       Computer software & data processing expenses         1,571           1,578           (7 )         (0.4 )         1,578           1,531           47           3.1       Shares tax         770           798           (28 )         (3.5 )         798           743           55           7.4       Professional services         1,297           1,465           (168 )         (11.5 )         1,465           1,595           (130 )         (8.2 )     Federal deposit insurance         500           689           (189 )         (27.4 )         689           1,022           (333 )         (32.6 )     Other operating expenses         1,713           1,772           (59 )         (3.3 )         1,772           1,664           108           6.5       Total operating expenses         20,160           20,057           103           0.5           20,057           20,069           (12 )         (0.1 )   Salaries and employee benefits are the largest category of other expenses. In general, they comprise approximately 54-57% of the Corporation’s total operating expenses. For the year 2011, salaries and benefits increased $667,000, or 6.2%. Salaries increased by $469,000, or 5.8% for the year, while employee benefits increased by $198,000, or 7.1%. Insurance costs increased $183,000, or 14.0%, from 2010 to 2011, due primarily to an increase in health insurance expense of $215,000, or 19.5%. Other insurance costs decreased $33,000, or 16.0%. Pension and 401(K) expenses were $477,000 in 2011, compared to $539,000 in 2010, an 11.5% decrease.   Occupancy expenses consist of the following:             ·     Depreciation of bank buildings           ·     Real estate taxes and property insurance           ·     Utilities           ·     Building repair and maintenance   Occupancy expenses have decreased by $9,000, or 0.5%, for 2011, compared to 2010. Building repair and maintenance costs declined by $36,000, or 27.0%, from 2010 to 2011. These costs were elevated in 2010 due to several unexpected repairs such as repairs to the heating and cooling system for the Corporation’s Technology Center. Partially offsetting this decrease, landscaping costs and snow removal costs both increased for 2011 compared to 2010 by $18,000, or 35.0%, and $4,000, or 14.4%, respectively.   Equipment expenses decreased by $21,000, or 2.6%, for 2011, compared to 2010. The largest component of equipment expenses is depreciation on furniture and fixtures, which decreased slightly from $512,000 in 2010 to $506,000 in 2011. The second largest component is equipment service contracts, which also decreased minimally from $199,000 in 2010 to $196,000 in 2011. Equipment repair and maintenance costs also decreased by $11,000 in 2011 compared to 2010. Partially offsetting these decreases, equipment rental costs increased by $7,000 for 2011 compared to 2010.   Advertising and marketing expenses for the year decreased $83,000, or 18.7%, from2010 levels. These expenses can be further broken down into two categories, marketing expenses and public relations. The marketing expenses totaled $250,000 in 2011, which was a $109,000, or 30.4% decrease, from 2010. The largest decrease in this category came in point of sale materials, which decreased $92,000, or 81.0%. Television advertising costs decreased by $26,000, or 31.7%, and radio advertising decreased by $8,000, or 9.8%, for 2011 compared to 2010. These decreases were partially offset by a $25,000 increase in research and business development expenses. Marketing expenses support the overall business strategies of the Corporation; therefore, the timing of these expenses is dependent upon those strategies. Public relations, the smaller category of advertising and marketing expenses, totaled $111,000 for 2011, compared to $86,000 for 2010, a $25,000, or 29.1% increase. Fairs and expos, promotional items, and sponsorships       41     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis         make up this category. An increase in sponsorships of $21,000, or 51.5%, for 2011 over 2010, was the primary reason for the increase in public relations expenditures.   The computer software and data processing expenses are comprised of STAR® network processing fees, software amortization, software purchases, and software maintenance agreements. The STAR network fees are the fees paid to process all ATM and debit card transactions. STAR network fees were $704,000 in 2011, and $809,000 in 2010, a $105,000, or 13.0% decrease. The reason for the reduction in STAR network fees is a reduction in the actual cost component charged to the Corporation for conducting these transactions. Software-related expenses increased from $768,000 in 2010, to $867,000 in 2011, a 12.9% increase. There were several significant software purchases in 2011 to support strategic initiatives and management anticipates further software purchases in 2012.   Bank shares tax expense was $770,000 for 2011, a decrease of $28,000, or 3.5%, from 2010. Two main factors determine the amount of Bank Shares Tax: the average value of shareholders’ equity and the average value of tax-exempt U.S. obligations. The tax is calculated on a rolling six-year average of taxable shares, which is the average shareholders’ equity of the Bank less the average amount of exempt U.S. obligations held. As a result, this tax generally increases as the Bank’s stockholders’ equity increases, and as the level of U.S. obligations as a percentage of assets stays relatively unchanged. Because the tax is calculated based on a rolling six-year average, the impact of a large change in shareholders’ equity for one year is significantly diminished. During 2011, the Bank was able to take advantage of additional tax credits which served to reduce the Bank shares tax expense for the year. Management would expect a small increase in this expense in 2012.   Professional services expenses decreased $168,000, or 11.5%, from 2010 levels. Professional services include accounting and auditing fees, legal fees, loan review fees, and other third-party services. Accounting and auditing fees decreased $20,000, or 6.8%, from 2010 to 2011 because of fewer costs related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Student loan servicing expense decreased $168,000, or 46.8%, due to the sale of the portfolio in the second quarter of 2011. Partially offsetting these decreases, trust processing fees increased by $20,000, or 30.6%, for 2011 compared to 2010.   The expenses associated with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance decreased by $189,000, or 27.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 2010. The FDIC expenses for 2011 were reduced primarily as a result of a change in assessment base. Prior to 2011, assessments were calculated based on the total deposits of a financial institution. Beginning in the second quarter of 2011, the assessment base was changed from deposits to total assets less tangible equity. This change resulted in significant savings for the Corporation. For more information, refer to the section titled “FDIC Insurance Premium Increase” found on page 12 of this Form 10-K filing.   Other operating expenses include the remainder of the Corporation’s operating expenses. Some of the larger items included in this category are:             ·     Postage           ·     Regulatory and tax assessments           ·     Director fees and expenses           ·     Travel expenses           ·     General supplies           ·     Charitable contributions           ·     Delinquent loan expenses   Other operating expenses decreased $59,000, or 3.3%, from 2010 to 2011. OREO expenses decreased by $120,000, or 53.2%, as losses of $177,000 were incurred on two OREO properties that were written down during 2010, and a loss of $60,000 was incurred on one OREO property in 2011. Delinquent loan expenses decreased by $30,000 from 2010 to 2011, as the Corporation had several larger expenses associated with maintaining insurance on properties in 2010 that were not experienced in 2011. The expense related to increasing the provision for off-balance sheet credit losses declined by $36,000, or 46.2%, for 2011 compared to 2010. Partially offsetting these decreases, director fees and expenses were higher by $92,000, or 39.4%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and miscellaneous loan expenses were higher by $25,000, or 34.0%. Various other expense categories had small increases and decreases making up the remainder of the annual variance.   Management uses the efficiency ratio as one metric to evaluate operating expenses. The efficiency ratio measures the efficiency of the Corporation in producing one dollar of revenue. For example, an efficiency ratio of 60% means it costs sixty cents to generate one dollar of revenue. A lower ratio represents better operational efficiency. The formula for calculating the efficiency ratio is total operating expenses, excluding foreclosed property and OREO expenses, divided by net interest income on an FTE basis, prior to the provision for loan losses, plus other income, excluding     42     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis      gain or loss on the sale of securities. For 2011, the Corporation’s efficiency ratio was 65.4%, an improvement from the 65.7% ratio for 2010. Management has a long-term goal of reducing the efficiency ratio to less than 65%.   Income Taxes   The majority of the Corporation’s income is taxed at a corporate rate of 34% for Federal income tax purposes. The Corporation is also subject to Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax; however, no taxable activity is conducted at the corporate level. The Corporation’s wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank, is not subject to state income tax, but does pay Pennsylvania Bank Shares Tax. The Bank Shares Tax expense appears on the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Income under operating expenses.   Certain items of income are not subject to Federal income tax, such as tax-exempt interest income on loans and securities, and increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance; therefore, the effective income tax rate for the Corporation is lower than the stated tax rate. The effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the Corporation’s provision for income tax by the pre-tax income for the applicable period.   For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Corporation recorded a tax provision of $1,186,000, compared to $965,000 for 2010. The effective tax rate for the Corporation was 14.2% for 2011, compared to 13.2% for 2010.   Due to lower earnings and a large percentage of tax-free income compared to total income, the Corporation became subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) in 2006 and remained in an AMT position through 2009. The AMT affects the amount of Federal income tax due and paid, but it does not affect the book tax provision. Being in an AMT position does potentially affect future book tax expense as management alters strategies designed to bring the Corporation out of an AMT position, such as reducing tax-free income. AMT tax paid can be utilized in the future as credits against regular income tax, when the regular corporate tax calculation exceeds the AMT calculation. The Corporation was not in an AMT position in 2011 or 2010, but was unable to utilize any of the AMT credits carried forward in 2010, due to the level of tax preference items and the utilization of other available tax credits. Management does anticipate utilizing a small amount of the AMT credits carried forward in 2011, when the 2011 Corporate tax return is filed. The AMT credits have an unlimited carry forward. Management anticipates that the Corporation will be able to utilize AMT credits in 2012 and future years dependent upon higher earnings levels.       43     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Financial Condition   Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents consist of the cash on hand in the Corporation’s vaults, operational transaction accounts with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), and deposits in other banks. The FRB requires a specified amount of cash available either in vault cash or in an FRB account. Known as cash reserves, these funds provide for the daily clearing house activity of the Corporation and fluctuate based on the volume of each day’s transactions. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation had $31.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $29.2 million as of December 31, 2010. In 2010, management began carrying larger cash balances as part of an asset liability strategy to provide an immediate hedge against interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Deposit growth outpaced loan growth in 2010 and 2011, which provided more liquidity and allowed management to carry higher cash levels. Management chose to maintain these higher cash levels rather than to invest these funds into securities while interest rates were at historic lows. This caused the level of cash and cash equivalents to be higher in 2011 than it was in 2010 and to generally grow throughout the year. As a result of the actions of the Board of Governors on December 16, 2008, financial institutions were able to receive a rate of 0.25%, equivalent to the Federal funds rate, on reserves held at the FRB. Because this rate now matched the Federal funds rate that could be obtained at other correspondent banks, management began to keep larger balances at the FRB and less Federal funds. Additionally, management made the decision to invest some excess cash in a money market account with TriState Capital in the fourth quarter of 2011. This money market account initially yielded a return of 0.80% and was reduced to 0.70%, which was the rate at December 31, 2011. This decision had the effect of altering the mix of cash and cash equivalents to more interest bearing deposits in banks and less Federal funds sold. The cash and cash equivalents represent only one element of liquidity. For further discussion on liquidity management, refer to Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   Sources and Uses of Funds   The following table shows an overview of the Corporation’s primary sources and uses of funds. This table utilizes average balances to explain the change in the sources and uses of funding. Management uses this analysis tool to evaluate changes in each balance sheet category. Trends identified from past performance assist management with decisions concerning future growth.   Some conclusions drawn from the following table are as follows:             ·     Balance sheet growth was significantly slower in 2011 compared to 2010.           ·     Larger balances of short-term investments consisting of cash and cash equivalents were maintained.           ·     Loan growth declined, causing more security investments.           ·     Deposit growth continued in 2011, but under 2010 growth levels with slightly less of a “flight-to-safety” impact.           ·     Interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits both grew steadily in 2011 compared to a decline in time     deposits.           ·     Non-interest bearing deposits, the most beneficial deposits, grew at a rate of nearly 10% in 2011.           ·     Borrowings decreased slightly in 2011.       44     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis              SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                                                   2011 vs. 2010         2010 vs. 2009               2011         2010         Increase (Decrease)         2010         2009         Increase (Decrease)       Average Balances       $         $         $         %         $         $         $         %       Short-term investments         17,769           8,973           8,796           98.0           8,973           1,426           7,547           529.2       Securities available for sale         267,087           248,763           18,324           7.4           248,763           236,606           12,157           5.1       Regulatory stock         4,295           4,875           (580 )         (11.9 )         4,875           4,916           (41 )         (0.8 )     Loans         415,216           429,034           (13,818 )         (3.2 )         429,034           419,689           9,345           2.2       Total Uses         704,367           691,645           12,722           1.8           691,645           662,637           29,008           4.4                                                                                                             Interest bearing demand         119,538           108,863           10,675           9.8           108,863           96,975           11,888           12.3       Savings accounts         98,175           90,309           7,866           8.7           90,309           80,649           9,660           12.0       Time deposits         241,357           264,581           (23,224 )         (8.8 )         264,581           256,062           8,519           3.3       Borrowings         79,754           80,451           (697 )         (0.9 )         80,451           92,518           (12,067 )         (13.0 )     Non-interest bearing demand         135,695           123,838           11,857           9.6           123,838           112,706           11,132           9.9       Total Sources         674,519           668,042           6,477           1.0           668,042           638,910           29,132           4.6     Securities Available For Sale   The Corporation classifies all of its securities as available for sale and reports the portfolio at fair market value. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation had $284.0 million of securities available for sale, which accounted for 36.8% of assets, compared to 34.7% as of December 31, 2010. This indicates that the securities portfolio on an ending-balance basis grew at a faster pace than total assets. Based on ending balances, the securities portfolio increased 9.6% from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011.   Each quarter management sets portfolio allocation guidelines and adjusts security portfolio strategy generally based upon the following factors:             ·     Performance of the various instruments           ·     Slope of the yield curve           ·     Level of and projected direction of interest rates           ·     ALCO positions as to liquidity, interest rate risk, and net portfolio value           ·     Changes in credit risk of the various instruments           ·     State of the economy and projected economic trends   The investment policy of the Corporation imposes guidelines to ensure diversification within the portfolio. The diversity specifications provide opportunities to maximize yield and minimize credit risk. The composition of the securities portfolio based on fair market value is shown in the following table.       SECURITIES PORTFOLIO  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             December 31,               2011         2010         2009               $         %         $         %         $         %                                                                                     U.S. government agencies         46,614           16.4           47,886           18.5           47,571           20.2       U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities         55,129           19.4           38,838           15.0           42,390           17.9       U.S. agency collateralized mortgage obligations         56,049           19.8           65,393           25.2           53,982           22.8       Private collateralized mortgage obligations         7,225           2.5           11,812           4.6           12,748           5.4       Corporate bonds         25,298           8.9           11,909           4.6           13,369           5.7       Obligations of states and political subdivisions         89,745           31.6           79,401           30.6           63,369           26.8       Marketable equity securities         3,951           1.4           3,899           1.5           2,906           1.2       Total securities available for sale         284,011           100.0           259,138           100.0           236,335           100.0         45     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        The Corporation typically invests excess liquidity into securities, primarily fixed-income bonds which account for 98.6% of all securities. The securities portfolio provides interest and dividend income to supplement the interest income on loans. Additionally, the securities portfolio assists in the management of both liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Refer to Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for further discussion of risk strategies. To provide maximum flexibility for management of liquidity and interest rate risks, the securities portfolio is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Management adjusts the value of the portfolio on a monthly basis to fair market value as determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles . Management has the ability and intent to hold all debt securities until maturity, and does not generally record impairment on the bonds that are currently valued below book value. Impairment was recorded in 2009, 2010, and 2011, on several of the Corporation’s private collateralized mortgage obligations (PCMOs) when it was determined that projected credit losses would occur.   Equity securities generally pose a greater risk to loss of principal since there is no specified maturity date on which the holder will recover the entire principal balance; however, only 1.4% of the Corporation’s securities are invested in equity securities. The equity securities are in the form of two CRA funds of which both are rated AAA. The equity securities have a book value of $4,000,000 with a fair market value of $3,951,000 as of December 31, 2011. One fund is an SBA CRA fund with a stable dollar price. The other is a CRA mutual fund where dollars are invested in CRA-qualifying mortgage pools. The CRA mutual fund has a book value of $1 million with a fair market value of $951,000 as of December 31, 2011. The equity percentage remained the same, but the CRA mutual fund decreased $1 million and the SBA CRA fund increased $1 million from December 31, 2010. The current guideline used by management for the amount to be invested in CRA-approved investments is approximately 0.5% of assets.   For both the bonds and equity securities the Corporation owns, recovery of the principal investment is dependent on the fair value of the security at the time of sale.   As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation held five PCMO securities with a book value of $8.3 million, a reduction of $4.6 million, or 35.7%, from the balance as of December 31, 2010. One of these securities, with a book value of $1.1 million, carried an AAA credit rating by at least one of the major credit rating services. The four remaining PCMOs, with a book value of $7.2 million, had credit ratings below investment grade, which is BBB- for S&P and Baa3 for Moodys. Management currently has no plans to sell these securities as management believes the current market values are not true indications of the value of the bonds based on cash flow analysis performed under severe stress testing. Management’s December 31, 2011 cash flow analysis on all of the Corporation’s PCMOs did indicate a need to take $24,000 of additional impairment on one of the four impaired PCMOs. This brought the total impairment taken during 2011 to $324,000.   Current analysis by management does not show the need to take additional impairment, but it is possible that foreclosure rates and the severity of losses on the foreclosures could increase, resulting in more credit losses to the Corporation. Management will continue to update cash flow analysis quarterly that incorporates the most current default rates and prepayment speeds on these instruments. It is possible that further impairment would be necessary if default rates rose to levels that have not yet been experienced, or if the severity of losses on foreclosures increased, or if prepayment speeds slowed to speeds not previously experienced. Prepayment speeds on all of the Corporation’s PCMOs have been relatively fast, which is assisting in the cash flow analysis. Faster prepayment speeds make it more likely that the Corporation’s principal is returned before additional credit losses are incurred.   Throughout the year, the Corporation was able to utilize the positively sloped treasury curve to add higher yielding tax-exempt securities to the portfolio which helped offset reductions in taxable security yields. Overall, the tax equivalent yield on all of the Corporation’s securities declined from 4.64% for 2010, to 4.22% for 2011. Growth in the securities portfolio occurred in part to offset the lack of loan growth being experienced by the Corporation. The majority of growth occurred in U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), obligations of states and political subdivisions, and corporate bonds. The MBS growth occurred due to the structure and attributes of the investment matching specific objectives of management’s securities strategy of providing:             ·     a stable and reliable cash flow for liquidity           ·     solid investments that generally carry AAA credit ratings           ·     strong income compared to other debt securities   Investments in a substantial amount of MBS assist management in maintaining a stable five-year ladder of cash flows, which is important in providing stable liquidity and interest rate risk positions. Unlike U.S. agency paper, corporate bonds, and obligations of states and political subdivisions, which only pay principal at final maturity, the U.S. agency MBS, CMO, and PCMO securities pay monthly principal and interest. The combined effect of all of these instruments paying monthly principal and interest provides the Corporation with a significant and reasonably stable cash flow. While cash flows coming off of MBS, CMOs, and PCMOs do slow down and speed up as interest rates increase or decrease,        46     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        the overall effect on the portfolio is minimal. The significance of these monthly cash flows relative to other security calls or maturities does act to soften or smooth out the Corporation’s total monthly cash flow from securities.   Obligations of states and political subdivisions, often referred to as municipal bonds, are tax-free securities that generally provide the highest yield in the securities portfolio. Since the financial crisis began in 2008, the municipal bond ratings have been adversely affected by downgrades on nearly all of the insurance companies backing municipal bond issues. Prior to the sharp decline in the health of the insurance companies, nearly 95% of the Corporation’s municipal bonds carried AAA credit ratings with the added insurance protection. Now, with the health of most of the insurers greatly diminished, the final rating of most municipal bonds has fallen to AA or A. As of December 31, 2011, only 4.3% of the Corporation’s municipal bonds carried an AAA rating.   The Corporation’s investment policy requires that municipal bonds not carrying insurance have a minimum S&P credit rating of A-or a minimum Moody credit rating of A3 at the time of purchase. In the current environment, the major rating services have tightened their credit underwriting procedures and are more apt to downgrade municipalities. Additionally, the very weak economy has reduced revenue streams for many municipalities and has called into question the basic premise that municipalities have unlimited power to tax, i.e. the ability to raise taxes to compensate for revenue shortfalls. As of December 31,2011, six municipal bonds, with a book value of $2.4 million, carried credit ratings under the Corporation’s initial purchase policy requirements. Two of these municipal bonds with a book value of $965,000 still carried investment grade ratings with the other four being non-rated or having withdrawn ratings. All six of these municipal bonds are paying as scheduled and management believes the bonds will continue to pay as contractually obligated until maturity. Five out of six of these bonds were carrying unrealized gain positions as of December 31, 2011, with all four non-rated bonds carrying an unrealized gain position. Despite the favorable valuation of these non-rated securities, management did obtain an independent credit analysis for these bonds in December 2011 to support the position to hold these securities.   As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation held corporate bonds with a total book value of $25.6 million and fair market value of $25.3 million. Management increased its holdings in corporate securities to approximately 9.2%of the portfolio compared to approximately 4.5% at December 31, 2010. Like any security, corporate bonds have both positive and negative qualities and management must evaluate these securities on a risk versus reward basis. Corporate bonds add diversity to the portfolio and provide strong yields for short maturities; however, by their very nature, corporate bonds carry a high level of risk should the entity experience financial difficulties. Management stands to possibly lose the entire principal amount if the entity that issued the corporate paper fails. As a result of the higher level of credit risk taken by purchasing a corporate bond, management has in place minimal credit ratings that must be met in order for management to purchase a corporate bond.   As of December 31, 2011, fourteen of the twenty-six corporate securities held by the Corporation were showing unrealized holding losses totaling $511,000. The remaining twelve securities were showing unrealized holding gains of $230,000, for a net loss of $281,000 overall. All of the corporate bonds had at least an A credit rating by one of the major credit rating services. Currently, there are no indications that any of these bonds would discontinue contractual payments.   The entire securities portfolio is reviewed monthly for credit risk and evaluated quarterly for possible impairment. In terms of credit risk and impairment, management views the Corporation’s two CRA fund investments differently because they have no maturity date. Bond investments could have larger unrealized losses but significantly less probability of impairment due to having a fixed maturity date. As of December 31, 2011, one of the Corporation’s two CRA funds, with a book value of $1 million, was showing unrealized losses of $49,000, a 4.9% price decline. The prices on this fund tend to lag behind decreases in U.S. Treasury rates. Management believes that the price declines are primarily rate driven, and temporary as opposed to other than temporary. Corporate bonds and private collateralized mortgage obligations have the most potential credit risk out of the Corporation’s debt instruments. Due to the rapidly changing credit environment and weak economic conditions, management is closely monitoring all corporate bonds and all private label securities.

As of December 31, 2011, the effective duration of the Corporation’s fixed income security portfolio was 2.5 for the base case or rates unchanged scenario. This compares to an effective duration of 3.0 as of December 31, 2010. Effective duration is the estimated duration or length of a security or portfolio, which is implied by the price volatility. Effective duration is calculated by converting price volatility to a standard measurement representing length. While it is a standard measurement representing length, it is not expressed in years. It is a measurement of price sensitivity, with lower durations representing better positions. An effective duration of 3.0 would approximate the duration of a three-year U.S. Treasury, a security that has no option risk or call provisions. Management receives effective duration and price volatility information quarterly on an individual security basis. Management’s target base case, or rates unchanged effective duration, is 2.5, which is the current duration of the portfolio. With the unlikelihood of interest rates increasing in 2012, management’s strategy is to maintain the securities portfolio’s effective duration close to 2.5 throughout the year to assist in retaining the Corporation’s limited rates-up exposure.   Effective duration is only one measurement of the length of the securities portfolio. Management receives and monitors a number of other measurements. In general, a shorter portfolio will adjust more quickly in a rising interest rate environment, whereas a longer portfolio will tend to generate more return over the long-term and will outperform a shorter portfolio when interest rates decline. Because the Corporation’s securities portfolio is longer than the average peer bank, it will generally outperform the average peer bank given static rates or a decline in interest rates, and will generally underperform given higher interest rates. Additionally, with fixed rate instruments, the longer the term of the security, generally the more fair value risk there is when interest rates rise. The converse is true when interest rates decline. Management utilizes other elements of the Corporation’s balance sheet to reduce exposure to higher interest rates including additional Prime-based loans and extending liabilities through time deposits and borrowings. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Mark Risk for further discussion on the Corporation’s management of asset liability risks including interest rate risk and fair value risk.   Throughout 2011 and as of December 31, 2011, all of the Corporation’s securities were held at the bank level. With the formation of the holding company on July 1, 2008, the Corporation is able to hold securities at the parent or holding company level. Tax strategies, market conditions, and other strategic decisions have factored into management’s decision not to transfer securities to the holding company, or purchase equity securities at the holding company level. Management and the Board will continue to evaluate changing market conditions and any opportunities in terms of transferring or purchasing securities at the holding company level.       48     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Loans   Net loans outstanding decreased $3.9 million, or 1.0%, from $408.1 million at December 31, 2010, to $404.2 million at December 31, 2011.

These loans totaled $8,904,000 as of December 31, 2011, $10,101,000 as of December 31, 2010, $11,754,000 as of December 31, 2009, $11,058,000 as of December 31, 2008, and $9,975,000 as of December 31, 2007.   The composition of the loan portfolio has undergone minor changes in recent years. The total of all categories of real estate loans comprises over 85% of total net loans. Commercial real estate is the largest category of the loan portfolio, consisting of approximately 46% of net loans.   Commercial real estate loans increased to $187.6 million at December 31, 2011, from $171.6 million at December 31, 2010, a 9.3% increase. As of December 31, 2011, commercial real estate loans accounted for 74.5% of total commercial loans, not including construction loans. This compared to 71.3% as of December 31, 2010. Most of the growth occurred in the agriculture mortgage area with those loans increasing to $73.3 million at December 31, 2011, from $60.5 million at December 31, 2010, a 21.2% increase. In 2011, agriculture mortgage loans represented a more significant portion of the commercial real estate category. As of December 31, 2011, these loans made up 39.1% of total commercial real estate loans compared to 35.3% as of December 31, 2010. The agriculture business was adversely affected by declining economic conditions that persisted throughout 2009 and growth in this portfolio was minimal. However, in 2010, economic conditions improved enough to encourage many farmers to proceed with projects and seek additional funding from the Corporation. As conditions continued to improve in 2011, and as the Corporation had a more focused agriculture initiative, agricultural mortgage loans continued to grow. The trend over the past five years has been for agricultural mortgages to grow as a percentage of commercial mortgages and as a percentage of the total loan portfolio.     49     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        These loans along with agricultural loans not secured by real estate have consistently accounted for over 10% of the entire loan portfolio. Management has always had an agricultural focus, which is due largely to the market area and type of customers the Corporation serves. Management expects a favorable trend in agricultural loans to continue in 2012.   Commercial construction loans represent a fairly small element of the Corporation’s total loan portfolio, accounting for 4.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2011, and 3.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2010. The increase from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase in construction projects in 2011 that moved ahead after being held up in prior years. As these projects were completed in 2011, some of the loans were converted from construction loans to permanent commercial mortgages. Construction activity had picked up from 2010 but was still fairly slow in 2011 and management expects a similar level of activity in 2012.   Commercial loans not secured by real estate account for 14.0% of total loans as of December 31, 2011, compared to 15.3% as of December 31, 2010. The balance of total commercial and industrial loans declined from $63.2 million at December 31, 2010, to $57.9 million at December 31, 2011, an 8.4% decrease. This category of loans generally includes unsecured lines of credit, truck, equipment, and receivable and inventory loans. Management anticipates that commercial loans not secured by real estate will experience slow to moderate growth in 2012. The current weaker economic conditions that have diminished the business outlook for many of the Corporation’s commercial customers have resulted in less demand for this type of loan. The Corporation provides credit to many small and medium-sized businesses. Much of this credit is in the form of Prime-based lines of credit to local businesses where the line may not be secured by real estate, but is based on the health of the borrower with other security interests on accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, or through personal guarantees. Businesses are also using more of their available credit from both unsecured and real estate secured lines of credit as economic conditions impacted their sales and cash flows.   As a result of the subprime and real estate crisis, which began to severely impact the economy in 2008, and the resulting credit and financial crisis that continued throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011, declines in the valuation of real estate became a point of concern. During late 2008 and early 2009, the area of commercial real estate (CRE) began to receive significant attention in terms of increased risk for banks following the significant declines in valuation that had occurred in residential real estate. Regulators were warning banks of concentrations in CRE loans and the increased risk that they could potentially bring to the financial institution. These commercial borrowers are viewed as having more risk due to the specific types of commercial loans that fall into this category and their reliance on the value of the real estate that is used as collateral.   The Corporation’s CRE profile has not changed materially from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011, and the Corporation remains well below the CRE guidelines of 100% of total risk-based capital for construction and development loans, and 300% of risk-based capital for total CRE loans. There are nine categories of CRE loans by definition. The Corporation does not have any real estate investment trust (REIT) loans, which are the ninth category. The following chart details the Corporation’s CRE loans as of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010.       CRE SUMMARY BY CATEGORY     (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                   2011           2010                             Total           Risk-Based           Total           Risk-Based                             Committed           Capital           Committed           Capital     CRE Type           CRE Description           Loan Amount           %           Loan Amount           %     0.01           Land Development Loans           6,325           7.5           7,863           9.9     0.02           1-4 Family Residential Construction Loans           2,215           2.6           3,187           4.0     0.03           Commercial Construction Loans           9,562           11.4           7,485           9.4     0.04           Other Land Loans           2,555           3.0           2,739           3.4     0.05           Multi-Family Property           12,580           15.0           13,631           17.2     0.06           Nonfarm, Nonresidential Property           22,187           26.4           21,865           27.5     0.07           Nonfarm, Nonresidential Property - Temp           1,353           1.6           1,096           1.4     0.08           Unsecured Loans to Developers           2,430           2.9           2,746           3.5                             59,207           70.4           60,612           76.3                                                                                   Corporation's Risk-Based Capital           84,138                       79,401                   50     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Management does not believe the Corporation’s CRE profile will change significantly during 2012. Management is closely monitoring all CRE loan types to be able to determine any negative trends that may occur. Management does internally monitor the delinquencies and risk ratings of these loans on a monthly basis and has established internal policy guidelines to restrict the amount of each of the above eight types of CRE loans as a percentage of capital. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation was within internal guidelines for all of the above CRE loan types.   The residential real estate category of total loans declined from $167.6 million on December 31, 2010, to $163.7 million as of December 31, 2011, a 2.3% decrease. This category includes closed-end fixed rate residential real estate loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties, including first and junior liens, and floating rate home equity loans. The 1-4 family residential mortgages account for the vast majority of residential real estate loans with fixed and floating home equity loans making up the remainder.   The first lien 1-4 family mortgages declined from $137.4 million on December 31, 2010, to $134.0 million as of December 31, 2011, a 2.5% decrease. These first lien 1-4 family loans made up 82% of the residential real estate total as of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010. The vast majority of the first lien 1-4 family closed end loans consist of single family personal first lien residential mortgages and home equity loans, with the remainder consisting of 1-4 family residential owner and non-owner-occupied mortgages. The weaker economic conditions and continued weak housing market adversely affected the non-owner occupied 1-4 family residential mortgages, resulting in a decline in those mortgages. Additionally, single family primary residence mortgages declined as new home sales were down and many primary residential mortgage customers had already refinanced their mortgages prior to 2011.   Given recent negative national events with regard to the mortgage industry and large commercial banks, more consumers prefer that their mortgage be held by a local financial institution. Even though the mortgage business in general has slowed, the Corporation has seen new business from other financial institutions where borrowers are refinancing adjustable rate instruments into traditional fixed-rate mortgages. Management believes that there may be a slowdown in mortgage originations in 2012 as the housing market continues to be weak and the amount of mortgages likely to be refinanced declines. The Corporation generally only holds 10-, 15-, and 20-year mortgages, and will sell any mortgage over 20 years. In the past, the majority of the new mortgage requests have been for 30-year mortgages; however, in 2010 and 2011, with the decline in housing valuations and customers refinancing to reduce monthly borrowing costs and total borrowings, more 10-, 15-, and 20-year mortgage requests were made.   As of December 31, 2011, the remainder of the residential real estate loans consisted of $14.7 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $15.0 million of variable rate home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). This compares to $17.7 million of fixed rate junior lien home equity loans, and $12.5 million of HELOCs as of December 31, 2010. Therefore, combined, these two types of home equity loans decreased from $30.2 million to $29.7 million, a decline of 1.7%. The increase in new HELOCs was not sufficient to offset the more moderate decline in the larger fixed rate junior lien home equity portfolio. With the decline in the Prime rate to 3.25%, which had already occurred by the end of 2008, and fixed home equity rates generally between 4% and 7%, customers shifted any new home equity borrowings to HELOCs and either paid off or continued to pay down their fixed rate home equity loans. Even with Prime-based floors established at 4.00% for all new HELOCs, there was still generally a movement toward the variable-rate HELOC product and away from the fixed-rate home equity loan. In the current environment, most borrowers were looking to consolidate and reduce their total debt position. Management believes the trends experienced in 2010 and 2011 will continue until the Prime rate begins to increase.   Consumer loans also represent a small portion of the Corporation’s loan portfolio, accounting for 0.9% of total loans as of December 31, 2011, and 3.1% as of December 31, 2010. The significant decline in this area was primarily due to the sale of the student loan portfolio. The Corporation sold its portfolio of student loans, which was included in the consumer loan category, totaling approximately $8.0 million in the second quarter of 2011. Additionally, in recent years, homeowners have turned to equity in their homes to finance cars and education rather than traditional consumer loans for those expenditures. Due to the credit crisis that occurred in 2008 and 2009, specialized lenders began pulling back on the availability of credit and more favorable credit terms. The underwriting standards of major financing and credit card companies began to strengthen in 2010 and 2011 after years of lower credit standards. This led consumers to seek unsecured credit away from national finance companies and back to their bank of choice. Management has seen the need for additional unsecured credit increase; however, this increased need for credit has only resulted in low levels of consumer loans for the Corporation. Slightly higher demand for unsecured credit is being offset by principal payments on existing loans. In the current weak economy, customers delay purchasing new and used cars which has the impact of reducing the consumer loan portfolio, as lower amounts of new loans are going on the books. Management anticipates that the Corporation’s level of consumer loans will likely be relatively unchanged in the near future, as the need for additional unsecured credit in the current weaker economic conditions is generally offset by those borrowers wishing to reduce debt levels and move away from the higher cost of unsecured financing relative to other forms of real estate secured financing.        51     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Management does not anticipate that the loan portfolio composition will change materially in 2012.   The following tables show the maturities for the loan portfolio by time frame for the major categories, and also the loans, which are floating or fixed, maturing after one year.       LOAN MATURITIES (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             Due in One Year or Less  $         Due After One Year Through Five Years  $         Due After Five Years  $         Total  $       Commercial real estate                                                     Commercial mortgages         8,325           5,466           81,556           95,347       Agriculture mortgages         5,528           5,902           61,857           73,287       Construction         7,569           333           11,055           18,957       Total commercial real estate         21,422           11,701           154,468           187,591                                                             Consumer real estate                                                     1-4 family residential mortgages         3,459           4,734           125,766           133,959       Home equity loans         4,482           3,216           6,989           14,687       Home equity lines of credit         —           26           14,978           15,004       Total consumer real estate         7,941           7,976           147,733           163,650                                                             Commercial and industrial                                                     Commercial and industrial         15,982           6,066           3,865           25,913       Tax-free loans         138           4,006           14,928           19,072       Agriculture loans         9,742           1,886           1,256           12,884       Total commercial and industrial         25,862           11,958           20,049           57,869                                                             Consumer         1,582           1,924           84           3,590       Total amount due         56,807           33,559           322,334           412,700         52     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis            FIXED AND FLOATING RATE LOANS DUE AFTER ONE YEAR  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                       Floating or               Fixed Rates         Adjustable Rates               $         $       Commercial real estate                             Commercial mortgages         7,528           79,494       Agriculture mortgages         8,288           59,471       Construction         2,324           9,064       Total commercial real estate         18,140           148,029                                     Consumer real estate                             1-4 family residential mortgages         122,414           8,086       Home equity loans         9,682           523       Home equity lines of credit         9,028           5,976       Total consumer real estate         141,124           14,585                                     Commercial and industrial                             Commercial and industrial         8,711           1,220       Tax-free loans         13,733           5,201       Agriculture loans         2,632           510       Total commercial and industrial         25,076           6,931                                     Consumer         2,008           —       Total amount due         186,348           169,545     The majority of the Corporation’s fixed-rate loans have a maturity date longer than five years. The primary reason for the longevity of the portfolio is the high percentage of real estate loans, which typically have maturities of 10, 15, or 20 years. Fixed-rate commercial mortgages have maturities that range from 3 years to 25 years. The most popular commercial mortgage term is a 20-year amortization with a 5-year reset period. In this case, the loan matures in twenty years but after five years either the loan rate resets to the Prime rate plus 0.75%, or a fixed rate for another reset period. The original maturity date does not change. Customers will generally opt for another fixed reset period within the original term.   Out of all the loans due after one year, 58.8% are fixed-rate loans as of December 31, 2011. This is slightly higher than the prior year end when 57.1% of the loans due after one year were fixed rate. These loans will not reprice to a higher or lower interest rate unless they mature or are refinanced by the borrower. Floating or adjustable rate loans reflect different types of repricing. Approximately 44% of the $169.6 million of floating or adjustable loans due after one year are true floating loans. These loans are tied to the Prime rate and will reprice when the Prime rate changes. A number of elements of the Corporation’s business and commercial Prime-based loans have been priced at levels above the Prime rate due to credit standing, and an actual Prime floor on new loans was instituted at the beginning of 2010. This remained in effect until the spring of 2011 when customers with stronger credits were again given access to the Prime rate while average and lower credits had levels above the Prime rate. Prime floors of 4.00% were instituted on the Corporation’s variable rate home equity loans at the end of 2008 and have remained in effect. The other 56%of the Corporation’s floating or adjustable loans due after one year are adjustable in nature and will reprice at a predetermined time in the amortization of the loan. These loans are mostly real estate commercial loans.   As of December 31, 2010, 49% of the $151.4 million of floating or adjustable loans due after one year were true floating rate loans, with the other 51% being adjustable in nature. The decrease in the true floating rate loan percentage from 49% as of December 31, 2010, to 44% as of December 31, 2011, was a function of more commercial borrowers converting to fixed rate loans from variable rate loans in anticipation of the possibility of rates going up as the floating or adjustable commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans due after one year declined from 2010 to 2011.   For more details regarding how the length of the loan portfolio and its repricing affects interest rate risk, please see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       53     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Non-Performing Assets   Non-performing assets include:             ·     Non-accrual loans           ·     Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing           ·     Troubled debt restructurings           ·     Other real estate owned       NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               $         $         $         $         $                                                                         Non-accrual loans         1,862           3,881           6,076           2,889           425       Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing         107           152           742           531           498       Troubled debt restructurings         —           1,676           1,540           —           —       Total non-performing loans         1,969           5,709           8,358           3,420           923       Other real estate owned         —           400           520           520           675       Total non-performing assets         1,969           6,109           8,878           3,940           1,598       Non-performing assets to net loans         0.49 %         1.50 %         2.10 %         0.97 %         0.42 %   Non-performing assets decreased $4.1 million from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011. The primary reason for this decrease was a decline in non-accrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, and other real estate owned during 2011. During the first half of 2011, non-accrual loans declined by $1.8 million as a result of the payoff of four non-accrual loans to one commercial borrower. The loans were secured by real estate under plans for a residential development. If a non-accrual loan is considered a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), it is classified as non-accrual for purposes of this non-performing asset schedule. A TDR is a loan where management has granted a concession to the borrower from the original terms. A concession is generally granted in order to improve the financial position of the borrower and improve the likelihood of full collection by the lender. There were five loans classified as a TDR as of December 31, 2010. Two of these loans paid off on February 28, 2011, leaving three loans that were restructured. Each of these three loans had principal deferments for a period of time, with no changes to the interest rate and final maturity. The interest rate is commensurate with the interest rate management would extend to another borrower with the same level of credit risk. Because all three of these loans have been performing, without delinquency, according to the modified terms temporarily extended in 2010, they no longer need to be classified as troubled debt restructurings in 2011. Management is monitoring delinquency trends and the level of non-performing loans closely in light of the current weak economic conditions. At this time, management believes that the potential for material losses related to non-performing loans has moderated with the level of non-performing assets down sharply and theCorporation’s total exposure reduced. Additionally, the direction of the risk is viewed as declining from the higher levels experienced in 2010 and early 2011.   As of December 31, 2011, there were fourteen loans totaling $1.9 million on non-accrual compared to eleven loans totaling $3.9 million that were on non-accrual as of December 31, 2010. The loans on non-accrual at December 31, 2011, included two loans to one borrower in the trucking industry totaling $1.1 million and a number of other smaller loans to various borrowers. Management has seen weakness in the trucking industry as a result of the weaker economy; however, the number of the Corporation’s borrowers that are severely delinquent or non-performing in this industry remains very small and has declined from the prior year-end. In the first quarter of 2011, the Corporation received a payoff on four real estate development loans totaling $1.8 million that were on non-accrual as of the end of 2010. These payoffs significantly decreased the balance of non-accrual loans. The Corporation’s diverse customer base, with many small businesses and industry types represented, has helped to avoid large concentrations in these industries. See Note P for further discussion on concentrations of credit risk. The severe economic conditions naturally will impact nearly all industries to some extent; however, the impact can vary greatly. Some businesses simply are not as successful in negotiating more difficult times, or may be impacted by non-economic matters like succession planning and poor business practice. Based on present conditions, management does not anticipate any significant new trends or the emergence of more severe trends beyond those already discussed.       54     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing decreased by $45,000 from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011. The decrease was due to payments received on loans or loans charged off during 2011. Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing consisted of three residential mortgages totaling $107,000 as of December 31, 2011.   As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation had no properties classified as other real estate owned (OREO). As of December 31, 2010, there was one OREO property, consisting of a manufacturing property that had been in OREO since December 2006. This property had been under an agreement of sale since late 2007, initially to one party, and then to a second party in 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, a new agreement of sale was signed for $525,000. The property was carried at $520,000, the sales price less estimated selling costs. Subsequently, this agreement was extended several times as a result of delays in addressing all environmental concerns of the property. As of December 31, 2010, the last agreement expired. As a result, management wrote the property down by $120,000 to $400,000 as management’s estimate of the current value of the property less all selling costs. The write down was recorded as a loss on OREO and was included in the Corporation’s operating expenses for 2010 on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The write-down was based on proceeding with estimated costs to complete remediation work on the property so it can be sold or held for commercial use with an environmental covenant. Subsequent to completing the remediation work, management made the decision to tear down the building and retain the land as bank owned property for future use or sale. The property was removed from OREO and classified as land as of December 31, 2011, when costs to raze the building and other related costs to improve the site were initially capitalized and then written down to a current appraisal. As a result, a $60,000 loss on OREO was recorded in 2011. This loss was also included in other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.   Management is monitoring total delinquency trends closely in light of the current weak economic conditions. Total delinquencies include loans 30 to 59 days past due, loans 60 to 89 days past due, loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing, and non-accrual loans. Total delinquencies as a percentage of total loans declined from 1.41% as of December 31, 2010, to 1.11% as of December 31, 2011. Management believes that the lower level of delinquencies experienced in 2011 will continue into 2012 as economic conditions slowly improve. Within the categories of delinquencies, management has seen little change in the percentages, other than the non-accrual category which decreased from 0.95% of total loans as of December 31, 2010, to 0.45% of total loans as of December 31, 2011. The 30 to 59 days past due percentage has seen a moderate increase from 0.37% as of December 31, 2010, to 0.57% as of December 31, 2011. All of the Corporation’s delinquency percentages are significantly below the Corporation’s national peer group. At this time, with economic conditions slightly improved, management believes that the potential for significant losses related to delinquent loans has moderated.   Allowance for Loan Losses   The allowance for loan losses is established to cover any losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance each quarter based upon a detailed analysis and calculation of the allowance for loan losses. This calculation is based upon a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The calculation includes estimates and is based upon losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The calculation, and detailed analysis supporting it, emphasizes delinquent and non-performing loans. The allowance calculation includes specific provisions for non-performing loans and general allocations to cover anticipated losses on all loan types based on historical losses. Based on the quarterly loan loss calculation, management will adjust the allowance for loan losses through the provision as necessary. Changes to the allowance for loan losses during the year are primarily affected by three events:             ·     Charge off of loans considered not recoverable           ·     Recovery of loans previously charged off           ·     Provision for loan losses   Strong credit and collateral policies have been instrumental in producing a favorable history of loan losses. In recent years, the Corporation has experienced an increase in the number of charged-off loans and a greater number of classified loans for which a loss is possible. For these reasons, the Corporation has experienced higher than normal levels of both the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses. The Allowance for Loan Losses table below shows the activity in the allowance for loan losses for each of the past five years. At the bottom of the table, two bench mark percentages are shown. The first is net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding for the year. The second is the total allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans.       55     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis            ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               $         $         $         $         $                                                                         Balance at January 1,         7,132           5,912           4,203           3,682           3,244       Loans charged off:                                                                 Commercial real estate         97           156           —           —           —       Commercial and industrial         315           416           1,126           150           925       Consumer         51           98           134           91           153       Total charge-offs         463           670           1,260           241           1,078       Recoveries of loans previously charged off:                                                                 Commercial real estate         —           —           —           —           —       Commercial and industrial         229           82           31           69           19       Consumer         7           8           18           24           51       Total recoveries         236           90           49           93           70       Net loans charged off         227           580           1,211           148           1,008       Provision charged to operating expense         1,575           1,800           2,920           669           1,446       Balance at December 31,         8,480           7,132           5,912           4,203           3,682       Net charge-offs as a % of average total loans outstanding         0.05           0.14           0.29           0.04           0.27                                                                         Allowance at year end as a % of total loans         2.06           1.72           1.38           1.02           0.96     Charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $463,000, compared to $670,000 for the same period in 2010. The charge-offs in 2010 and 2011 represent a typical level of consumer and small business loan charge-offs that would result from management charging off unsecured debt over 90 days delinquent with little likelihood of recovery.   During 2011, the Corporation provided $1,575,000 to the allowance for loan losses, compared to $1,800,000 during 2010. The provision is used to increase the allowance for loan losses to a level considered adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. With the level of delinquent and non-performing loans decreasing throughout 2011, management’s quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses showed the need to decrease the provision to bring the allowance to lower levels. While the Corporation’s classified loans (substandard and doubtful rated loans) increased throughout 2011, the level of special mention loans decreased significantly. Special mention is the first rating that indicates the loan is receiving special attention. Further declines in the loan’s performance result in a substandard rating. If conditions deteriorate further, with full repayment no longer expected, the loan is rated doubtful.   From December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, there was a $6.1 million, or 12.4% total reduction, in total special mention and substandard loans; however there was a significant shift of special mention credits to the substandard rating, which is a deterioration of credit grade. Substandard loans increased by $7.1 million, or 24.9%, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011, while special mention loans decreased $13.2 million, or 62.6%. While the decrease in special mention loans was larger than the increase in substandard loans, the substandard loans require significantly more allowance for loan losses; therefore increases in the allowance were necessary to cover the higher level of substandard credits. The level of substandard loans grew primarily between December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011, peaking on September 30, 2011, and showing a slight reduction by the end of 2011. While the percentage of loan delinquencies declined slightly during 2011, the balance of classified loans remains high. As a result, management desires to continue to increase the allowance until it can be demonstrated that the total substandard loans have been reduced from the recent elevated levels.   The allowance as a percentage of total loans represents the portion of the total loan portfolio for which an allowance has been provided. For the five-year period from 2007 through 2011, the Corporation maintained an allowance as a percentage of loans in a range between 0.96% and 2.06%. In 2011 alone, the percentage increased from 1.72% at the beginning of the year, to 2.06% as of December 31, 2011. The composition of the Corporation’s loan portfolio has not changed materially from 2010 to 2011; however, management views the overall risk profile of the portfolio to be higher in 2011 as a result of more loans being classified as substandard. These classifications require larger provision amounts        56     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        due to a higher potential risk of loss. Management will continue to increase the allowance as a percentage of total loans as long as the quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses demonstrates the need to allocate additional amounts based on estimated credit losses inherent in the current portfolio, utilizing historical and projected credit losses and levels of qualitative and quantitative risks that are appropriate based on the current credit environment. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Corporation had lower balances of classified loans and continued low levels of delinquent and non-performing loans so the provision expense was reduced. Even with a lower provision expense, the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans will likely continue to increase in the beginning of 2012. This would occur because the provision expense will still likely exceed the amount of charge-offs experienced and based upon very low levels of projected loan growth. This trend would end if the total classified loans declined materially in 2012, resulting in a lower level of required allowance, which would allow management to further reduce the provision expense.   The net charge-offs as a percentage of average total loans outstanding indicates the percentage of the Corporation’s total loan portfolio that has been charged off during the period. The Corporation has historically experienced very low net charge-off percentages due to conservative credit practices. The 0.05% shown for 2011 is less than the 0.14% experienced in 2010 as fewer loans were charged off during the year.   The following table provides the allocation of the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses by major loan classifications. The percentage of loans indicates the percentage of the loan portfolio represented by the indicated loan type. Real estate loans represent a more substantial portion of the outstanding loan portfolio and, while real estate secured loans have historically experienced lower losses than non-real estate secured loans, more of these types of loans have indicated deteriorating financial health that may result in future losses. The prolonged weak economy has impacted consumer financial strength and the value of residential homes continues to be down significantly. Meanwhile, the overall credit quality of real estate backed business loans deteriorated as the value of the real estate collateral declined and business conditions continued to be weak. Additionally, this portion of the loan portfolio grew $12.1 million, or 3.6%, requiring more allocation. Conversely, the commercial and industrial loans not secured by real estate have historically experienced higher loan losses and required a larger percentage of the reserve, despite representing a much smaller portion of the outstanding loan portfolio. The dollar amount of allocation for commercial and industrial loans remained relatively unchanged while the balance of commercial and industrial loans decreased $5.3 million, or 8.5%. The amount of substandard commercial and industrial loans, along with the declining financial performance of this group, supports the need for a higher percentage of the reserve allocation. As of December 31, 2011, 57.4% of the allowance was allocated to real estate secured loans, both consumer and commercial, which make up 85.1% of all loans, while 33.3% of the allowance was allocated to commercial and industrial loans, which make up 14.0% of all loans.       ALLOCATION OF RESERVE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                         % of                   % of                   % of                   % of                   % of               $         Loans         $         Loans         $         Loans         $         Loans         $         Loans                                                                                                                                     Real estate         4,865           85.1           3,859           81.8           1,917           79.2           2,293           80.0           1,558           77.7       Commercial and industrial         2,825           14.0           2,816           15.1           3,902           17.9           1,727           17.4           1,768           19.5       Consumer         61           0.9           75           3.1           83           2.9           155           2.6           166           2.8       Unallocated         729           —           382           —           10           —           28           —           190           —       Total allowance for loan losses         8,480           100.0           7,132           100.0           5,912           100.0           4,203           100.0           3,682           100.0     Premises and Equipment   Premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, increased by $879,000, or 4.3%, to $21,366,000 on December 31, 2011, from $20,487,000 as of December 31, 2010. In 2011, $1,954,000 of new investments were made in premises and equipment while the Corporation recorded $1,075,000 of accumulated depreciation on existing assets resulting in the increase in net premises and equipment during 2011.

The Corporation’s $4,148,000 of regulatory stock holdings as of December 31, 2011, consisted of $3,960,000 of FHLB of Pittsburgh stock, $151,000 of FRB stock, and $37,000 of ACBB stock. All of these stocks are valued at a stable dollar price, which is the price used to purchase or liquidate shares; therefore, the investment is carried at book value and there is no fair market value adjustment.   The Corporation’s investment in FHLB stock is required for membership in the organization. The amount of stock required is dependent upon the relative size of outstanding borrowings from FHLB. Excess stock is typically repurchased from the Corporation at par if the borrowings decline to a predetermined level. In years preceding 2008 and throughout most of 2008, the Corporation earned a return or dividend on the amount invested. In December 2008, the FHLB announced that it had suspended the payment of dividends and the repurchase of excess capital stock to preserve its capital level. That decision was based on FHLB’s analysis and consideration of certain negative market trends and the impact those trends had on their financial condition. As a result, for years 2009, 2010, and 2011 no dividends were received on the Corporation’s FHLB stock.   Since the fourth quarter of 2010, the FHLB has announced several excess capital stock repurchases. This has caused the Corporation’s capital stock position to decline from $4,492,000 as of December 31, 2010, to $3,960,000 as of December 31, 2011. With the stock repurchases, the Corporation no longer has any excess capital stock. As a result, any future excess capital stock repurchase would not impact the Corporation unless the amount of FHLB borrowings would decline and then cause an excess capital stock position.   Throughout 2011, FHLB conducted regular repurchases of excess stock. This sustained pattern of purchasing back excess capital stock, based on the improved financial performance of FHLB, has resulted in management’s conclusion that its investment in FHLB stock is not other-than-temporarily impaired. The Corporation will continue to monitor the financial condition of the FHLB quarterly to assess its ability to continue to periodically repurchase excess capital stock and resume payment of a dividend.   Subsequent to December 31, 2011, but prior to the filing of this report, the FHLB announced the payment of a dividend to its shareholders effective February 23, 2012. The dividend payment will be equivalent to 0.10 percent annualized and is a significant step towards the restoration of ongoing dividend payments. While the FHLB has not committed to regular dividend payments, it will continue to monitor the overall financial performance of the bank in order to determine the status of future dividends. The resumption of dividends supports the Corporation’s conclusion that its investment in FHLB stock is not impaired.   Management believes that the FHLB will continue to be a primary source of wholesale liquidity for both short-term and long-term funding. Management’s strategy in terms of future use of FHLB borrowings is addressed under the Borrowings section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.   Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)   The Corporation owned life insurance with a total recorded cash surrender value (CSV) of $16,552,000 on December 31, 2011, compared to $15,891,000 on December 31, 2010. The Corporation holds two distinct BOLI programs. The first, with a CSV of $4,266,000, was the result of insurance policies taken out on directors of the Corporation electing to participate in a directors’ deferred compensation plan. The program was designed to use the insurance policies to fund future annuity payments as part of a directors’ deferred compensation plan that permitted deferral of Board pay from 1979 through 1999. The plan was closed to entry in 1999 when directors were no longer provided with the option of deferring their Board pay. The Corporation pays the required premiums for the policies and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies. The life insurance policies in the plan generally have annual premiums; however, the premium payments are not required after the first five years. The Corporation continues to make the premium payments, which cover the cost of the insurance and generally adds to the cash surrender value of the policy.   The second BOLI plan was taken out on a select group of the Corporation’s officers, with the additional income generated used to offset rising benefit costs. In May 2006, the first $5 million BOLI investment was made on these officers. In 2007, a second $5 million BOLI investment was made that covered officers who were not included in the initial BOLI investment and included additional investments on some officers already covered. During 2011, the CSV for this plan increased from $11,847,000 as of December 31, 2010, to $12,286,000 as of December 31, 2011, a 3.7%       58     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis          increase. The increase resulted solely from the returns on the insurance policy investment. The Corporation purchased whole life policies for this BOLI plan and is the owner and beneficiary of the policies.    Deposits   The Corporation’s total ending deposits increased $10.1 million, or 1.7%, from $595.6 million on December 31, 2010, to $605.7 million on December 31, 2011. Customer deposits are the Corporation’s primary source of funding for loans and investments. In recent years, economic concerns, the credit crisis, and poor performance of the stock market and other types of investments led customers back to banks as safe places to invest money, in spite of low interest rates. This trend continued in 2011, but not to the magnitude in 2010. Despite growth of new deposits, the actual mix of deposit categories has remained relatively stable.   The Deposits by Major Classification table, shown below, provides the average balances and rates paid on each deposit category for each of the past three years. The average 2011 balance carried on all deposits was $594.8 million, compared to $587.6 million for 2010. This represents an increase of 1.2% on average deposit balances. The increase in average deposit balances from 2009 to 2010 was 7.5%. Average balances provide a more accurate picture of growth in deposits because deposit balances can vary throughout the year. In addition, the interest paid is based on average deposit balances carried during the year calculated on a daily basis.       DEPOSITS BY MAJOR CLASSIFICATION  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  Average balances and average rates paid on deposits by major category are summarized as follows:                                                 December 31,               2011         2010         2009               $         %         $         %         $         %       Non-interest bearing demand         135,689           —           123,838           —           112,706           —       NOW accounts         62,355           0.28           56,909           0.36           53,111           0.58       Money market deposit accounts         57,183           0.36           51,954           0.45           43,864           0.70       Savings accounts         98,175           0.10           90,309           0.12           80,649           0.20       Time deposits         241,357           1.96           264,581           2.51           256,062           3.19       Total deposits         594,759                       587,591                       546,392                 The growth and mix of deposits is often driven by several factors including:             ·     Convenience and service provided           ·     Fees           ·     Permanence of the institution           ·     Possible risks associated with other investment opportunities           ·     Current rates paid on deposits compared to competitor rates   The Corporation has been a stable presence in the local area and offers convenient locations, low service fees, and competitive interest rates because of a strong commitment to the customers and the communities that it serves. Management has always priced products and services in a manner that makes them affordable for all customers. This, in turn, creates a high degree of customer loyalty, which has provided stability to the deposit base. In 2009, management began to see a new trend develop that resulted in deposit in flows due to financial concerns regarding the health of other competing financial institutions, as opposed to merger-related activity. The Corporation continues to generally benefit from the customers’ desire to conduct business with a smaller financial institution versus a larger institution. Larger financial institutions have been in the forefront in terms of negative publicity related to the governmental actions commonly referred to as the “bailout”of the banking industry. The Corporation chose not to take governmental funds issued as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This was a beneficial decision in that some customers viewed the recipients of TARP funds to be in weaker financial condition. While this was not always the case, the public’s perception often determines where they will direct their funds. In addition to these trends, the Corporation’s deposits benefited from the eighth full service branch location opened in September 2008, and the remodeling of the Denver branch office and the Main branch office which occurred in 2010 and 2011, respectively.   The average balance of the Corporation’s core deposits, including non-interest bearing demand deposits, NOW accounts, MMDA accounts, and savings accounts, grew $30.4 million, or 9.4%, since December 31,2010. Several converging factors are assisting in the increase in core deposits. Interest rates are at historic lows, which results in less motivation        59     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis         for customers to shop interest rates because the differential between high and low rates is compressed. Customers are trying to build more liquid funds to meet cash flow needs in a slowing economy, as a matter of prudence. The safety of FDIC-insured funds and immediate or nearly immediate funds in the current environment appear to be more of a concern to customers than interest rates. Additionally, the concern over the stability of some larger financial institutions has led customers seeking security to community banks with high levels of capital and long-standing reputations.   Time deposits are typically a more rate-sensitive product making them a less reliable source of funding. Time deposits fluctuate as consumers search for the best rates in the market, with less allegiance to any particular financial institution. Due to current adequate funding levels from all sources, the Corporation’s recent time deposit strategy has been to offer rates that meet or slightly exceed the average rates offered by the local competing banks. Time deposit balances declined in 2011, with the average balance decreasing by $23.2 million, or 8.8%, from the average balances at December 31, 2010. Time deposits are a safe investment with FDIC coverage insuring no loss of principal below certain levels. Prior to October 3, 2008, FDIC coverage was $100,000 on non-IRA time deposits, and $250,000 on IRA time deposits. Effective October 3, 2008, the FDIC insurance increased to $250,000 for all deposit accounts with the signing of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which was made permanent under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The higher FDIC insurance limits benefited the Corporation due to its strong level of capital and consistent earnings. In this environment, the Corporation experienced time deposit growth throughout 2009 and 2010 due to weak earnings and/or capital levels of competing national, regional, and local community banks. Often as customers placed more time deposits in financial institutions, due to the declining stock market, they did not want to exceed the FDIC insurance limits and, therefore, the Corporation gained many new time deposit customers. The decrease in time deposit balances from 2010 to 2011 can be attributed to customers moving funds away from time deposits into core deposit accounts as well as carrying lower levels of cash due to economic conditions.   Historically, most time deposit growth was in terms less than 18 months, which have lower rates than longer term time deposits, indicating that customers were not looking for long-term investments with the best return, but shorter safe investments. In 2011, time deposits declined in total, with the majority of the decline in shorter term products. The five-year term was the only time deposit product that showed some growth. This growth was indicative of the customers’ perception that rates would not increase in the short-term. Management expects that, as equity investments begin to rebound in performance, there may continue to be a reduction in the Corporation’s time deposit balances.   As of December 31, 2011, time deposits over $100,000 made up 32.3% of the total time deposits. This compares to 30.4% on December 31, 2010. Since time deposits over $100,000 are made up of relatively few customers with large dollar accounts, management monitors these accounts closely due to the potential for these deposits to rapidly increase or decrease. Management believes the minimal growth in time deposits over $100,000 during 2011was due primarily to the fairly weak equity market throughout much of the year. The following table provides the total amount of time deposits of $100,000 or more for the past three years by maturity distribution.       MATURITY OF TIME DEPOSITS OF $100,000 OR MORE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                 December 31,               2011         2010         2009               $         $         $       Three months or less         13,959           20,982           14,010       Over three months through six months         8,255           8,627           11,135       Over six months through twelve months         15,095           13,755           17,954       Over twelve months         39,354           33,208           29,908       Total         76,663           76,572           73,007     In order to meet future funding obligations, it is necessary to review the timing of maturity for large depositors, like the time deposits of $100,000 or more. The Corporation monitors all large depositors to ensure that there is a steady flow of maturities. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation had a typical laddering of large time deposits.

Additionally, for more information on the maturity of time deposits, see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       60     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Borrowings   Total borrowings were $73.0 million and $74.5 million as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The Corporation was purchasing no short-term funds as of December 31, 2011, or December 31, 2010. Short-term funds are used for immediate liquidity needs and are not typically part of an ongoing liquidity or interest rate risk strategy; therefore, they fluctuate more rapidly.   Long-term borrowings decreased $1.5 million, or 2.0%, from $74.5 million on December 31, 2010, to $73.0 million on December 31, 2011. The Corporation uses two main sources for long-term borrowings: Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and repurchase agreements through brokers or correspondent banks. Both of these types of borrowings are used as a secondary source of funding and to mitigate interest rate risk. Management will continue to analyze and compare the costs and benefits of borrowing versus obtaining funding from deposits.   Total FHLB borrowings were $53.0 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $49.5 million as of December 31, 2010. The increase in FHLB borrowing balances related to the maturity of a repurchase agreement in 2011 that was replaced with an FHLB advance. Other FHLB advances that matured during the year were replaced with new loans, reducing the rates paid on the borrowings. The borrowings with FHLB are primarily fixed-rate loans. The Corporation occasionally uses convertible select loans that give advantageous pricing compared to fixed-rate loans; however, they generally have additional risk due to a call feature being included on the loan. Management compares the length of the first call of these borrowings to the normal length of time deposits. Often, a convertible select borrowing from FHLB can provide a longer period of rate protection than the term of some of the Corporation’s typical time deposit promotions. The call feature may be based on a time requirement or a specific rate requirement. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation held $15.0 million of convertible select loans, compared to $20.0 million as of December 31, 2010.   As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation held $20.0 million of repurchase agreements, compared to $25.0 million as of December 31, 2010. The repurchase agreements all have some call feature, much like FHLB convertible select loans. All of the callable repurchase agreements had an initial period where no call could occur. However, all of the callable repurchase agreements are now into their call period where calls could occur on a quarterly basis. It is unlikely that any of the callable repurchase agreements will be called in the near future, as their rates are well above market rates for the same term. Two of the repurchase agreements existing prior to 2008, totaling $10 million are in a back-end fixed rate with a quarterly call, whereas the other two repurchase agreements are at a floating rate that resets quarterly with a call provision. The interest rates on callable repurchase agreements are more favorable than non-callable long-term fixed rates; therefore, these instruments assist the Corporation in increasing net interest margin. In all cases, the rate advantage of callable borrowing structures is weighed against any additional interest rate risk exposure taken compared to non-callable borrowing structures. Management views repurchase agreement transactions as a diversification of funding outside of the FHLB, because principally the same funding structures can be obtained from FHLB. Management monitors the amount of convertible select loans that could be called in any one year to ensure that the Corporation does not have a concentrated amount of call risk.   To limit the Corporation’s exposure and reliance on a single funding source, the Corporation’s Asset Liability Policy sets a goal of maintaining the amount of borrowings from the FHLB to 15% of the Corporation’s total assets. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation was within this policy guideline at 6.9% of asset size with $53.0 million of total FHLB borrowings. The Corporation also has a policy that limits total borrowings from all sources to 150% of the Corporation’s capital. As of December 31, 2011, total borrowings from all sources amounted to 88.5% of the Corporation’s capital, well under the policy guideline. The Corporation has maintained FHLB borrowings and total borrowings within these guidelines throughout the year.   The Corporation continues to be well under the FHLB maximum borrowing capacity (MBC), which is $186.9 million as of December 31, 2011. The Corporation’s two internal policy limits are far more restrictive than the FHLB MBC, which is calculated and set quarterly by FHLB. Due to recent circumstances in the financial and mortgage sectors, FHLB has been under regulatory and operating performance pressures and has taken steps to preserve capital. As a result, in December 2008, the FHLB suspended the dividend paid on stock owned by banks that have outstanding FHLB borrowings, and had discontinued the regular repurchase of excess stock if a bank reduces its borrowings. However, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the FHLB did begin the regular repurchase of excess stock from member institutions, including the Corporation, and in the first quarter of 2012, the FHLB announced a dividend payment equivalent to 0.10 percent annualized.       61     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis          Stockholders’ Equity   Federal regulatory authorities require banks to meet minimum capital levels. The Corporation maintains capital ratios well above those minimum levels and higher than the peer group average. The risk-weighted capital ratios are calculated by dividing capital by risk-weighted assets. Regulatory guidelines determine risk-weighted assets by assigning assets to one of four risk-weighted categories. The calculation of Tier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets includes a reduction to capital for the allowance for loan losses, thereby making this ratio lower than the Total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio. See Notes I and M to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on capital transactions.   The following table reflects the Corporation’s capital ratios compared to regulatory capital requirements for prompt corrective action.       REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS       Capital Ratios         Regulatory Requirements               As of         As of         As of                                   Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Dec. 31,         Adequately         Well               2011         2010         2009         Capitalized         Capitalized       Total Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets         17.9 %         17.5 %         16.0 %         8.0 %         10.0 %     Tier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets         16.6 %         16.3 %         14.8 %         4.0 %         6.0 %     Tier I Capital to Average Assets         10.2 %         9.8 %         9.7 %         4.0 %         5.0 %   The high level of capital maintained by the Corporation provides a greater degree of financial security and acts as a non-interest bearing source of funds. Conversely, a high level of capital, also referred to as equity, makes it more difficult for the Corporation to improve return on average equity, which is a benchmark of shareholder return. The Corporation’s capital is affected by earnings, the payment of dividends, changes in accumulated comprehensive income or loss, and equity transactions.   Total dividends paid to shareholders during 2011, were $2,742,000, or $0.96 per share, compared to $2,732,000, or $0.96 per share paid to shareholders during 2010. The Corporation uses current earnings and available retained earnings to pay dividends. The Corporation’s current capital plan calls for management to maintain Tier I Capital to Average Assets between 9.0% and 12.0%. Management also desires a dividend payout ratio of approximately 40%. This ratio will vary according to income, but over the long term, management’s goal is to average a payout ratio of 40%. For 2011, the dividend payout ratio was 38.4%. Management anticipates that the payout ratio for 2012 will be similar to the 2011 ratio.   The amount of unrealized gain or loss on the Corporation’s securities portfolio is reflected, net of tax, as an adjustment to capital, as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the capital section of the Corporation’s balance sheet. An unrealized gain increases the Corporation’s capital while an unrealized loss reduces the Corporation’s capital. This requirement takes the position that, if the Corporation liquidated at the end of each period, the current unrealized gain or loss of the securities portfolio would directly impact the Corporation’s capital. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation showed unrealized gains, net of tax, of $4,221,000, compared to unrealized gains of $442,000 as of December 31, 2010. The changes in unrealized gains or losses are due to normal changes in market valuations of the Corporation’s securities as a result of interest rate movements.   On July 1, 2008, ENB Financial Corp was formed. The retirement of all treasury shares was required as part of the formation of ENB Financial Corp. As a result, management needed treasury shares to be utilized for the existing Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Therefore, on August 14, 2008, the Board authorized a stock buyback plan for the purchase of up to 140,000 shares of common stock for corporate purposes. Since formation of the plan, 71,000 shares of treasury stock have been repurchased, and 60,274 reissued, with 10,726 treasury shares existing on December 31, 2011. In 2011, the net capital impact of shares being purchased and reissued was not significant with 16,000 shares being purchased and 18,792 shares reissued. This type of activity is again expected in 2012 as management desires to purchase a sufficient amount of shares to cover the needs of the existing stock purchase plans so a minimum level of treasury shares is maintained.   Contractual Cash Obligations   The Corporation has a number of contractual obligations that arise from the normal course of business. The following table summarizes the contractual cash obligations of the Corporation as of December 31, 2011, and shows the future periods in which settlement of the obligations is expected. The contractual obligation numbers below do not include        62     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        accrued interest. Refer to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referenced in the table for additional details regarding these obligations.       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                                                                     Less than         1-3         4-5         More than                         1 year         years         years         5 years         Total               $         $         $         $         $       Time deposits (Note F)         112,645           63,003           62,025           —           237,673       Borrowings (Notes G and H)         17,500           27,000           28,500           —           73,000       Total contractual obligations         130,145           90,003           90,525           —           310,673     In February 2011, management entered into a $750,000 construction contract involving remodeling of the Main branch office. Construction was completed in 2011 and as of December 31, 2011, no remaining payments existed for this contract.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   In the normal course of business, the Corporation typically has off-balance sheet arrangements related to loan funding commitments. These arrangements may impact the Corporation’s financial condition and liquidity if they were to be exercised within a short period of time. As discussed in the liquidity section to follow, the Corporation has in place sufficient liquidity alternatives to meet these obligations. The following table presents information on the commitments by the Corporation as of December 31, 2011. For further details regarding off-balance sheet arrangements, refer to Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)             December 31,               2011               $       Commitments to extend credit:                 Revolving home equity loans         19,575       Construction loans         17,436       Real estate loans         5,360       Business loans         64,876       Consumer loans         2,085       Other         4,204       Standby letters of credit         6,947       Total         120,483         63     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis          Recently Issued Accounting Standards   Refer to Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion on recently issued accounting standards.   Critical Accounting Policies   The presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from these estimates.   Allowance for Loan Losses   A material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses. Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable. The Corporation’s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in an earlier section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses, it is likely that well-informed individuals could make materially different assumptions and, therefore, calculate a materially different allowance amount. Management uses available information to recognize losses on loans; however, changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.   Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities   Securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. The term “other than temporary” is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent. It indicates that the prospect of a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the security. Once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.   Deferred Tax Assets   The Corporation uses an estimate of future earnings to support the position that the benefit of deferred tax assets will be realized. If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and the Corporation’s net income will be reduced. Deferred tax assets are described further in Note L to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       64     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis          Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   As a financial institution, the Corporation is subject to four primary market risks:       ·     Credit risk     ·     Liquidity risk     ·     Interest rate risk     ·     Fair value risk   The Board of Directors has established an Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) to measure, monitor, and manage these four primary market risks. The Asset Liability Policy has instituted guidelines for all of these primary risks, as well as other financial performance measurements with target ranges. The Asset Liability goals and guidelines are consistent with the Strategic Plan goals.   For discussion on credit risk, refer to the sections on non-performing assets, allowance for loan losses, Note C, and Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Liquidity   Liquidity refers to having an adequate supply of cash available to meet business needs. Financial institutions must ensure that there is adequate liquidity to meet a variety of funding needs, at a minimal cost. Minimal cost is an important component of liquidity. If a financial institution is required to take significant action to obtain funding, and is forced to utilize an expensive source, it has not properly planned for its liquidity needs. Funding new loans and covering deposit withdrawals are the primary liquidity needs of the Corporation. The Corporation uses a variety of funding sources to meet liquidity needs, such as:       ·     Deposits     ·     Loan repayments     ·     Maturities and sales of securities     ·     Borrowings from correspondent and member banks     ·     Repurchase agreements     ·     Brokered deposits     ·     Current earnings   One of the measurements used in liquidity planning is the Maturity Gap Analysis. The Maturity Gap Analysis below measures the amount of assets maturing within various time frames versus liabilities maturing in those same periods. These time frames are referred to as gaps and are reported on a cumulative basis. For instance, the one-year gap shows all assets maturing one year or less from a specific date versus the total liabilities maturing in the same time period. The gap is then expressed as a percentage of assets over liabilities. Mismatches between assets and liabilities maturing are identified and assist management in determining potential liquidity issues.   The maturity gap analysis does not include non-interest earning assets and non-interest bearing liabilities, with the exception of non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. The non-interest bearing demand deposits are considered additional deposit liabilities with a 0.00% interest rate, which acts to lower the overall interest rate paid on total deposits. For purposes of this analysis, items like cash, premises and equipment, bank owned life insurance, and other assets are considered non-interest earning assets and are not included in assets maturing. On the liability side, the only liability not included is other liabilities, which represent open obligations of the Corporation.   It is unlikely that maturing assets would equal maturing liabilities because, on the balance sheet, assets do not equal liabilities. However, after non-earning assets and liabilities are pulled out, the remaining assets and liabilities maturing are relatively close resulting in a cumulative maturity gap percentage near 100%. For purposes of this analysis, $688.4 million of assets mature in all time frames while $680.6 million of liabilities mature in all time frames, resulting in a 101.1% cumulative maturity gap. So, while a cumulative maturity gap of 100% would indicate that the same amount of assets and liabilities are maturing within the specified period, this is rather unlikely to occur within any time frame, or on a cumulative basis. The Corporation has historically been liability sensitive in the shorter time frames because loans usually have longer maturities than deposits, resulting in ratios under 100%. In the 1-year to 3-year time frame, assets maturing exceed liabilities maturing. Liability maturities exceed deposit maturities in the 3-year to 5-year time frame. In the time frame of 5 years and greater, asset maturities exceed liability maturities.       65     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis          The table below shows the six-month, one-year, three-year, and five-year cumulative gaps as of December 31, 2011, along with the cumulative maturity gap guidelines monitored by management. For the purposes of this analysis, core deposits without a specific maturity date are spread across all time periods based on historical behavior.       MATURITY GAP ANALYSIS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)                       More than         More than         More than                         Less than         6 months         1 year         3 years         More than       Maturity Gap       6 months         to 1 year         to 3 years         to 5 years         5 years               $         $         $         $         $       Assets maturing         86,410           62,743           160,071           110,807           268,345       Liabilities maturing         100,923           59,524           139,392           132,270           248,465       Maturity gap         (14,513 )         3,219           20,679           (21,463 )         19,880       Cumulative maturity gap         (14,513 )         (11,294 )         9,385           (12,078 )         7,802                                                                         Maturity gap %         85.6 %         105.4 %         114.8 %         83.8 %         108.0 %                                                                       Cumulative maturity gap %         85.6 %         93.0 %         103.1 %         97.2 %         101.1 %                                                                       Cumulative maturity gap % guideline         45% to 155 %         60% to 140 %         75% to 125 %         85% to 115 %               As of December 31, 2011, all cumulative maturity gaps were well within Corporate Policy guidelines and were fairly consistent with the prior year’s levels. Management worked to purposefully extend liabilities in 2011 by offering attractive rates on long-term CDs to encourage customers to invest for more than one year. Customers were more willing to invest in five-year CDs during 2011 because of the unlikelihood of rates increasing in the near term as well as the disparity in interest rates from one-year to five-year investments. During 2011, U.S. Treasury rates fell to record levels which increased prepayment speeds on the Corporation’s MBS, CMO, and PCMO securities. This increased cash flows and shortened the Corporation’s assets. Additionally, several long-term advances were initiated to take advantage of the low interest rates and lock in funding for four or five years. These factors were primarily responsible for the high gap ratios as of December 31, 2011. While the Corporation is still liability sensitive in three out of five cumulative time frames, the gap ratios indicate that this liability sensitivity is lowand well within Corporate Policy guidelines.   Given the likelihood that short term interest rates will not increase in 2012, management’s current position is to maintain the cumulative maturity gap percentages within guidelines but not necessarily increase them in 2012. The risk in maintaining high gap percentages is that, should interest rates not rise, maturing assets will reprice at lower rates. This is referred to as repricing risk. Carrying high gap ratios in the current environment brings on an increased level of repricing risk, which impacts the Corporation’s interest income and margin. The risk of liabilities repricing at higher interest rates is very low in the present environment as most maturing deposits are repricing to a lower interest rate. Therefore, higher levels of liabilities repricing are currently benefiting the Corporation. Given the alternative investment options available, management also does not perceive significant risk that deposits maturing in the shorter time frames will leave the Corporation. It is likely that, should market interest rates rise in 2013, customer behavior patterns will change and deposits will be more rate sensitive with a greater portion potentially leaving the Corporation. These maturity gaps are closely monitored along with additional liquidity measurements discussed below. Management will work to maintain these ratios within policy guidelines throughout 2012 in order to position for the increased likelihood of rising interest rates in future time periods.   In addition to the cumulative maturity gap analysis discussed above, management utilizes a number of other important liquidity measurements that management believes have advantages over, and give better clarity to, the Corporation’s present and projected liquidity.   The following is a listing of the Corporation’s other liquidity measurements, along with a short definition, that are evaluated in an effort to monitor and mitigate liquidity risk:       ·     Core Deposit Ratio – Core deposits as a percentage of assets     ·     Funding Concentration Analysis – Alternative funding sources outside of core deposits as a percentage of assets     ·     Short-term Funds Availability – Readily available short-term funds as a percentage of assets     ·     Securities Portfolio Liquidity – Cash flows maturing in one year or less as a percentage of assets and securities     ·     Borrowing Limits – Internal borrowing limits in terms of both FHLB and total borrowings     ·     Three, Six, and Twelve-month Projected Sources and Uses of Funds – Net projected liquidity surplus/shortage shown     for each period       66     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        These measurements are designed to prevent undue reliance on outside sources of funding and ensure a steady stream of liquidity is available should events occur that would cause a sudden decrease in deposits or large increase in loans or both, which would in turn draw significantly from the Corporation’s available liquidity sources.   As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation was within guidelines for all of the above measurements. These measurements are tracked and reported quarterly by management to both observe trends and ensure the measurements stay within desired ranges. Management is confident that a sufficient amount of internal and external liquidity exists to provide for significant unanticipated liquidity needs.   Interest Rate Risk and Fair Value Risk   Identifying the interest rate risk of the Corporation’s interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities is essential to managing net interest margin and net interest income. In addition to the impact on earnings, management is also concerned about how much the value of the Corporation’s assets might fall or rise given an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment. Interest rate sensitivity analysis (IRSA) measures the impact of a change in interest rates on the net interest income and net interest margin of the Corporation, while net portfolio value (NPV) analysis measures the change in the Corporation’s capital fair value, given interest rate fluctuations. Therefore, the two primary approaches to measuring the impact of interest rate changes on the Corporation’s earnings and fair value are referred to as:       ·     Changes in net interest income     ·     Changes in net portfolio value   The Corporation’s asset liability model is able to perform dynamic forecasting based on a wide range of assumptions provided. The model is flexible and can be used for many types of financial projections. The Corporation uses financial modeling to forecast balance sheet growth and earnings. The results obtained through the use of forecasting models are based on a variety of factors. Both earnings and balance sheet forecasts make use of maturity and repricing schedules to determine the changes to the Corporation’s balance sheet over the course of time. Additionally, there are many assumptions that factor into the results. These assumptions include, but are not limited to:       ·     Projected interest rates     ·     Timing of interest rate changes     ·     Slope of the U.S. Treasury curve     ·     Spreads available on securities over the U.S. Treasury curve     ·     Prepayment speeds on loans held and mortgage-backed securities     ·     Anticipated calls on securities with call options     ·     Deposit and loan balance fluctuations     ·     Competitive pressures affecting loan and deposit rates     ·     Economic conditions     ·     Consumer reaction to interest rate changes   For the interest rate sensitivity analysis and net portfolio value analysis shown below, results are based on a static balance sheet reflecting no projected growth from balances as of December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010. While it is unlikely that the balance sheet will not grow at all, management considers a static analysis of this sort to be the most conservative and most accurate means to evaluate fair value and future interest rate risk. Management does run expected growth scenarios through the asset liability model to most accurately predict future financial performance. This is done separately and apart from the static balance sheet approach discussed above to test fair value and future interest rate risk. The static balance sheet approach is used to reduce the number of variables in calculating the model’s accuracy in predicting future net interest income. It is appropriate to pull out various balance sheet growth scenarios which could be utilized to compensate for a declining margin. By testing the model using a base model assuming no growth, this variable is eliminated and management can focus on predicted net interest income based on the current existing balance sheet.   As a result of the many assumptions, this information should not be relied upon to predict future results. Additionally, both of the analyses shown below do not consider any action that management could take to minimize or offset the negative effect of changes in interest rates. These tools are used to assist management in identifying possible areas of risk in order to address them before a greater risk is posed.       67     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        Changes in Net Interest Income   The changes in net interest income reflect how much the Corporation’s net interest income would be expected to increase or decrease given a change in market interest rates. The changes in net interest income shown are measured over a one-year time horizon and assume an immediate rate change on the rate sensitive assets and liabilities. This is considered the more important measure of interest rate sensitivity due to the immediate effect that rate changes may have on the overall performance of the Corporation. The following table takes into consideration when financial instruments would most likely reprice and the duration of the pricing change. It is important to emphasize that the information shown in the table is an estimate based on hypothetical changes in market interest rates.       CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME                                                                     2011         2010         Policy               Percentage         Percentage         Guidelines               Change         Change         %                                                 400 basis point rise         5.8           6.1           (20.0 )     300 basis point rise         2.7           3.5           (15.0 )     200 basis point rise         (0.0 )         1.2           (10.0 )     100 basis point rise         (2.3 )         (0.2 )         (5.0 )     Base rate scenario         —           —           —       50 basis point decline         (2.1 )         0.4           (2.5 )     100 basis point decline         (4.0 )         (1.6 )         (5.0 )   This table shows the effect of an immediate interest rate shock over a one-year period on the Corporation’s net interest income. Base rate is the Prime rate.   The above analysis shows a slightly negative impact to the Corporation’s net interest income in both down-rate scenarios and in the up 100-basis point scenario. The up 200-basis point scenario is neutral and there is a positive impact in the up 300 and 400 scenarios. In the unique current rate environment, the amount of the Corporation’s assets repricing higher will be fairly large due to the amount of variable rate loans that will reprice immediately when Prime increases. On the liability side, if rates increase, it is typical for management to react slowly in increasing deposit rates. Even when deposit rates are increased, they are typically increased at a fraction of the increase in the Prime rate. In the current environment, if interest rates rise, it is expected that deposit rates will move upward, but more slowly than in past rates-up cycles. It is unlikely that rates will go down, but in the event that they would go lower, the Corporation would have exposure to all maturing fixed-rate loans and securities which would reprice lower while most of the Corporation’s interest-bearing deposits could not be repriced any lower. The analysis above focuses on immediate rate movements, referred to as rate shocks, and measured over the course of one year. The Corporation’s model also has the ability to measure changes to net interest income given interest rate changes that occur more slowly over time. This type of modeling is referred to as “interest rate ramps,” where a set change in rates occurs over a period of time. If rates were to move upward slowly over the course of the next year, the results are very close to the results using a rate shock.   The analysis shows that net interest income would decline if rates increased by 100 basis points. Because many loans have a rate floor of 4.00%, if rates rise by 100 basis points, the full effect would not be felt on a portion of the loan portfolio. Even in the rates up 200-basis point scenario, net interest income remains flat. It is not until rates up 300 or 400 basis points that any benefit is recognized.   Additionally, the analysis shows that the Corporation’s net interest income would decrease if rates declined. This results from several types of deposit products’ current offering rates being at or near the floor for pricing. For instance, savings accounts had an interest rate of 0.10% as of December 31, 2011. Management is only able to reduce the rate to zero; therefore, any reduction in the savings rate only benefits earnings in the case of a 10-basis point rate decline. Since most loan rates would be able to reprice lower under the declining rate scenarios and the deposit rate decreases are limited, the Corporation would have less earnings under a declining rate scenario. It is likely that management would control the reduction in loan rates to limit the reduction in net interest income in a downward rate environment.       68     Table of Contents   ENB FINANCIAL CORP Management’s Discussion and Analysis        The assumptions and analysis of interest rate risk are based on historical experience during varied economic cycles. Management believes these assumptions to be appropriate; however, actual results could vary significantly. Management uses this analysis to identify trends in interest rate sensitivity and determine if action is necessary to mitigate asset liability risk.   Change in Net Portfolio Value   The change in net portfolio value gives a long-term view of the exposure to changes in interest rates. The NPV is calculated by discounting the future cash flows to the present value based on current market rates. The NPV is the mathematical equivalent of the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities.   The table below indicates the changes in the Corporation’s NPV as of December 31, 2011. As part of the Asset Liability Policy, the Board of Directors has established risk measurement guidelines to protect the Corporation against decreases in the net portfolio value and net interest income in the event of the interest rate changes described below. All rates-up scenarios for both 2011 and 2010 show the Corporation within ALCO guidelines. The rates-down scenarios in 2011 show the Corporation outside of policy guidelines, but it is nearly impossible for rates to go down any further, so these scenarios are not of concern.       CHANGES IN NET PORTFOLIO VALUE                                                           2011         2010         Policy               Percentage         Percentage         Guidelines               Change         Change         %                                                 400 basis point rise         (25.7 )         (33.7 )         (40.0 )     300 basis point rise         (19.2 )         (22.1 )         (30.0 )     200 basis point rise         (13.6 )         (11.5 )         (20.0 )     100 basis point rise         (7.3 )         (2.3 )         (10.0 )     Base rate scenario         —           —           —       50 basis point decline         (11.5 )         3.6           (5.0 )     100 basis point decline         (21.2 )         9.8           (10.0 )   This table shows the effect of an immediate interest rate shock on the net portfolio value of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities. Base rate is the Prime rate.   The results as of December 31, 2011, indicate that the Corporation’s NPV would experience a valuation loss in all interest rate scenarios. The percentage change for all rates-up scenarios is within policy guidelines, and the results are similar to the changes in net portfolio value as of December 31, 2010. In 2010, management changed the seven rate scenarios because of the greatly diminished likelihood that interest rates would decline further. While the Prime rate of 3.25% could potentially decline, since the Federal Reserve’s target Federal funds rate is already down to 0.00% to 0.25%, and because the Prime rate and the Federal funds rate generally move in tandem, it is not likely that the Prime rate will decline further. Therefore, management removed the rates down 200 and 300 basis-point scenarios and went with only two rates-down scenarios of 50 and 100 basis points. These two rates-down scenarios could happen but are very unlikely. Management then added a rates-up 400 basis point scenario to model a more aggressive rates-up move.   There is portfolio value volatility as rates rise indicating that the Corporation loses NPV, which is the result of the value of assets declining at a faster rate than the decrease in the value of deposits. Stated in another manner, an increase in interest rates would devalue the Corporation’s assets. This decrease would be larger than the decline in the value of the Corporation’s liabilities. The material reductions in the rates up 200, 300, and 400 basis point scenarios are caused by longer term securities and mortgages on the asset side of the balance sheet. During 2011, the Corporation’s municipal bond segment of the securities portfolio grew slightly due to tax strategies, low loan growth, and high tax equivalent yields available. The book value of municipal bonds grew $4.7 million, or 5.9%, from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011. These securities represent the Corporation’s longest and highest yielding securities and they also carry the largest amount of fair value risk if long term rates increase. Traditional 1-4 family residential mortgages are the largest loan type in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. These assets are predominately 15- and 20-year mortgages which represent the Corporation’s longest loan assets. Management anticipates that the rates-up NPV reductions will decline slightly going forward as reductions in longer term assets occur in 2012.       69     Table of Contents            ENB FINANCIAL CORP   		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     25     Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations   Forward Looking Statements   Certain statements in this report may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact. Such statements are often characterized by the use of qualified words (and their derivatives) such as “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “anticipate” or other similar words. Although the Company believes that its expectations with respect to certain forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its existing knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance or achievements of the Company will not differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those anticipated depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the effects of and changes in: general economic conditions, the interest rate environment, legislative and regulatory requirements, competitive pressures, new products and delivery systems, inflation, changes in the stock and bond markets, technology, downturns in the trucking, mining, and timber industries, downturns in the housing market affecting manufacturers of household cabinetry and thus, employment, effects of mergers and/or downsizing in the poultry industry in Hardy County, continued challenges in the current economic environment affecting our financial condition and results of operations, continued deterioration in the financial condition of the U.S. banking system impacting the valuations of investments the Company has made in the securities of other financial institutions, and consumer spending and savings habits, particularly in the current economic environment. Additionally, actual future results and trends may differ from historical or anticipated results to the extent: (1) any significant downturn in certain industries, particularly the trucking and timber industries are experienced; (2) loan demand decreases from prior periods; (3) the Company may make additional loan loss provisions due to negative credit quality trends in the future that may lead to a deterioration of asset quality; (4) the Company may not continue to experience significant recoveries of previously charged-off loans or loans resulting in foreclosure; (5) the Company is unable to control costs and expenses as anticipated, (6) legislative and regulatory changes could increase expenses (including changes as a result of rules and regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act); (7) the effects of the last year’s down grade of U.S. Government Securities by one of the credit rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations, earnings and financial condition; and (8) any additional assessments imposed by the FDIC. Additionally, consideration should be given to the cautionary language contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The Company does not update any forward-looking statements that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of the Company.   Introduction   The following discussion focuses on significant results of the Company’s operations and significant changes in our financial condition or results of operations for the periods indicated in the discussion. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this report. Current performance does not guarantee, and may not be indicative of, similar performance in the future.   Critical Accounting Policies   The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The financial statements contained within these statements are, to a significant extent, financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset or relieving a liability. In addition, GAAP itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method. Although the economics of these transactions would be the same, the timing of events that would impact these transactions could change.    Allowance for Loan Losses   The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450, Contingencies, which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance.       11     Table of Contents        The allowance consists of specific, general and unallocated components. The specific component relates to loans that are determined to be impaired. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on management’s internal risk ratings as well as historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors. An unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses.   GAAP does not specify how an institution should identify loans that are to be evaluated for collectability, nor does it specify how an institution should determine that a loan is impaired. Each subsidiary of Highlands uses its standard loan review procedures in making those judgments so that allowance estimates are based on a comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio. For loans that are individually evaluated and found to be impaired, the associated allowance is based upon the estimated fair value, less costs to sell, of any collateral securing the loan as compared to the existing balance of the loan as of the date of analysis.   All other loans, including individually evaluated loans determined not to be impaired, are included in a group of loans that are measured under ASC 450 to provide for estimated credit losses that have been incurred on groups of loans with similar risk characteristics. The methodology for measuring estimated credit losses on groups of loans with similar risk characteristics in accordance with ASC 450 is based on each group’s historical net charge-off rate, adjusted for the effects of the qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses as of the evaluation date to differ from the group’s historical loss experience.   Post Retirement Benefits and Life Insurance Investments   The Company has invested in and owns life insurance policies on key officers. The policies are designed so that the company recovers the interest expenses associated with carrying the policies and the officer will, at the time of retirement, receive any earnings in excess of the amounts earned by the Company. The Company recognizes as an asset the net amount that could be realized under the insurance contract as of the balance sheet date. This amount represents the cash surrender value of the policies less applicable surrender charges. The portion of the benefits, which will be received by the executives at the time of their retirement, is considered, when taken collectively, to constitute a retirement plan. Therefore the Company accounts for these policies using guidance found in ASC 715, Compensation –Retirement Benefits . ASC 715 requires that an employer’s obligation under a deferred compensation agreement be accrued over the expected service life of the employee through their normal retirement date. Assumptions are used in estimating the present value of amounts due officers after their normal retirement date. These assumptions include the estimated income to be derived from the investments and an estimate of the Company’s cost of funds in these future periods. In addition, the discount rate used in the present value calculation will change in future years based on market conditions.   Intangible Assets   The Company carries intangible assets related to the purchase of two banks. Amounts paid to purchase these banks were allocated as intangible assets. Generally accepted accounting principles were applied to allocate the intangible components of the purchases. The excess was allocated between identifiable intangibles (core deposit intangibles) and unidentified intangibles (goodwill). Goodwill is required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, and the value of the goodwill adjusted accordingly, should impairment be found. As of December 31, 2011, the Company did not identify an impairment of this intangible. In addition to the intangible assets associated with the purchases of banks, the company also carries intangible assets relating to the purchase of naming rights to certain features of a performing arts center in Petersburg, WV. Intangible assets other than goodwill, which are determined to have finite lives, are amortized based upon the estimated economic benefits received.   A summary of the change in balances of intangible assets can be found in Note Twenty One to the Financial Statements.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   Refer to Note Two of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.       12     Table of Contents          Overview of 2011 Results   Net income for 2011 decreased by 12.56% as compared to 2010. The Company’s net interest income decreased slightly as the reduction in interest expenses matched the decreases in interest income. The Company experienced an increase in the provision for loan losses of 3.93% or $137,000 from 2010 to 2011. Non-interest income increased 0.33%. The increase in non-interest income was the result of increase in life insurance investment income in excess of the decreases in overdraft fees, service charge fees, and non-recurring gains on the sale of securities during 2010. Non-interest expense increased 0.27% due largely to decreases in employee related costs and decreased FDIC insurance premium rates offset by impairment write-downs of other real estate owned.   The table below compares selected commonly used measures of bank performance for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:                 2011           2010       Annualized return on average assets         0.34 %         0.38 %     Annualized return on average equity         3.41 %         4.00 %     Net interest margin (1)         4.47 %         4.49 %     Efficiency Ratio (2)         70.30 %         69.87 %     Earnings per share (3)       $ 1.04         $ 1.19         (1)     On a fully taxable equivalent basis and including loan origination fees     (2)     Non-interest expenses for the period indicated divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income for the period indicated.     (3)     Per weighted average shares of common stock outstanding for the period indicated.   Net Interest Income   2011 Compared to 2010   Net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, decreased 0.97% from 2010 to 2011. The decrease in net interest income was driven by changes in average rates earned on assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities and by changes in the relative mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.   For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company’s average earning assets decreased 0.53%; the percent of average loan balances, the highest earning of the Company’s earning assets, to total average earning assets decreased slightly to 86.79% in 2011 compared to 89.26% in 2010. The decrease in earning assets was more than offset by the decrease in interest bearing liabilities of 2.28% from 2010 to 2011. These changes in the relative mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the change in the average yields offset resulting in the decrease of the Company’s net interest income.   Federal Reserve target rate for federal funds sold continues to impact yields on earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities. The Company experienced declining rates for 2011 as compared to 2010 on all components of earning assets and on the savings and time deposit components of interest bearing liabilities.   The Company believes that its deposits will be sufficient to fund the current and expected loan demand.  Should the loan demand increase beyond the Company’s current expectations, the Company may be required to fund these loans with borrowings which could result in a reduction of net interest margin. However, management believes total net interest income would not be adversely affected.   Also, balances of non-performing loans and other real estate acquired through foreclosure have increased from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. Increases in balances of non-accrual loans and other real estate acquired through foreclosure often have adverse effects on net interest income. Should balances of non-accrual loans and other real estate acquired through foreclosure continue to increase, net interest margin may decrease accordingly. Further discussion relating to the Company’s loan portfolio and credit quality can be found as part of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis under the headings of “Loan Portfolio” and “Credit Quality.”       13     Table of Contents        The table below illustrates the effects on net interest income of changes in average volumes of interest bearing liabilities and earning assets from 2010 to 2011 and changes in average rates on interest bearing liabilities and earning assets from 2010 to 2011 (in thousands of dollars):        EFFECT OF RATE-VOLUME CHANGES ON NET INTEREST     (On a

mortgage and construction lender and extends commercial loans to small and medium sized businesses within its primary service area. The Company’s commercial lending activity extends across its primary service areas of Grant, Hardy, Hampshire, Mineral, Randolph, Tucker and Pendleton counties in West Virginia and Frederick County, Virginia. Consistent with the Company’s focus on providing community-based financial services, the Company does not attempt to diversify its loan portfolio geographically by making significant amounts of loans to borrowers outside of its primary service area.   The table below summarizes the Company’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (in thousands of dollars):                 2011           2010           2009           2008           2007       Real estate mortgage       $ 162,214         $ 168,226         $ 162,619         $ 156,877         $ 169,122       Real estate construction         23,711           33,746           30,759           27,210           15,560       Commercial         101,517           97,089           97,606           97,709           79,892       Installment         25,614           30,275           44,499           43,958           45,625       Total Loans         313,056           329,336           335,483           325,754           310,199                                                                         Allowance for loan losses         (6,111 )         (5,407 )         (4,021 )         (3,667 )         (3,577 )                                                                       Net Loans       $ 306,945         $ 323,929         $ 331,462         $ 322,087         $ 306,622     There were no foreign loans outstanding during any of the above periods.   The following table illustrates the Company’s loan maturity distribution as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands of dollars):                 Maturity Range                 Less than 1 Year           1-5 Years           Over 5 Years           Total       Loan Type                                                     Commercial       $ 34,889         $ 19,231         $ 47,397         $ 101,517       Real estate mortgage and construction         49,198           33,334           103,393           185,925       Installment         5,695           16,774           3,145           25,614       Total Loans       $ 89,782         $ 69,339         $ 153,935         $ 313,056     Credit Quality   The principal economic risk associated with each of the categories of loans in the Company’s portfolio is the creditworthiness of its borrowers. Within each category, such risk is increased or decreased depending on prevailing economic conditions. The risk associated with the real estate mortgage loans and installment loans to individuals varies based upon employment levels, consumer confidence, fluctuations in value of residential real estate and other conditions that affect the ability of consumers to repay indebtedness. The risk associated with commercial, financial and agricultural loans varies based upon the strength and activity of the local economies of the Company’s market areas. The risks associated with real estate construction loans vary based upon the supply of and demand for the type of real estate under construction.   An inherent risk in the lending of money is that the borrower will not be able to repay the loan under the terms of the original agreement. The allowance for loan losses (see subsequent section) provides for this risk and is reviewed at least quarterly for adequacy. This review also considers concentrations of loans in terms of geography, business type or level of risk. While lending is geographically diversified within the service area, the Company does have some concentration of loans in the area of agriculture (primarily poultry farming), and the timber and coal extraction industries. The Company recognizes these concentrations and considers them when structuring its loan portfolio.        16     Table of Contents        Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due (including non-performing restructured loans). Non-accrual loans are loans on which interest accruals have been discontinued. Loans are typically placed in non-accrual status when the collection of principal or interest is 90 days past due and collection is uncertain based on the net realizable value of the collateral and/or the financial strength of the borrower. Also, the existence of any guaranties by federal or state agencies is given consideration in this decision. The policy is the same for all types of loans. Non-performing loans do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources.   The following table summarizes the Company’s non-performing loans, restructured loans accruing interest and other real estate owned at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 (in thousands of dollars):               December 31, 2011         December 31, 2010       Loans on non-accrual status       $ 8,021         $ 6,979       Loans delinquent 90 days or more still accruing       $ 536         $ 866       Total non-performing loans       $ 8,557         $ 7,845                                     Restructured loans still accruing       $ 13,055         $ 1,037       Other real estate owned (OREO)       $ 7,070         $ 4,700                                     Total non-performing loans and other risk assets       $ 28,682         $ 13,582                                   Restructured loans are loans on which the interest rate or repayment terms have been changed due to financial hardship of the borrower. Restructured loans that are performing in accordance with modified terms are $11,233,000 and $5,219,000 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified terms totaled $2,919,000 as of December 31, 2011. All restructured loans are included in impaired loans in Note Five. The increase in restructured loans is the result of including loan balloon renewal agreements for troubled borrowers in accordance with the new guidelines adopted with ASU 2011-02.   The carrying value of real estate acquired through foreclosure was $7,070,000 at December 31, 2011 and $4,700,000 at December 31, 2010. The Company's practice is to value real estate acquired through foreclosure at the lower of (i) an independent current appraisal or market analysis less anticipated costs of disposal, or (ii) the existing loan balance. The Company does not anticipate further losses from the disposal of other real estate owned.   Because of its large impact on the local economy, management continues to monitor the economic health of the poultry industry. The Company has direct loans to poultry growers and the industry is a large employer in the Company’s trade area. In addition, multiple manufacturers of household cabinetry are large employers in the Company’s primary trade area. Due to the downturn in the housing market nationally, there have been indications that the demand for cabinetry has decreased, impacting the performance of these manufacturers. Because of the impact on the local economy, management has begun to monitor the performance of this industry as it relates to local employment trends. Additionally, the Company’s loan portfolio contains a segment of loans collateralized by heavy equipment, particularly in the trucking, mining and timber industries. Because of the impact of the slowing economic conditions on the housing market, the timber sector has experienced a recent downturn. While the Company has experienced some losses related to the downturn in this industry, no material losses related to foreclosures of loans collateralized by assets typical to the timber harvest industry have occurred. This industry has seen some improvement during the current year, resulting in reduced financial stresses on the Company’s borrowers.       17     Table of Contents        Allowance For Loan Losses   The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in the current loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (i) ASC 450, “ Contingencies ” which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and (ii) ASC 310, “ Receivables ”, which requires that loans be identified which have characteristics of impairment as individual risks (e.g. the collateral, present value of cash flows or observable market values are less than the loan balance).   Each of the Company’s banking subsidiaries determines the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses independently using the same allowance for loan loss methodology. The allowance is calculated quarterly and adjusted prior to the issuance of the quarterly financial statements. All loan losses charged to the allowance are approved by the boards of directors of each bank at their regular meetings. In addition the boards of directors of each bank review the allowance methodology for consistency and reasonableness. The allowance is reviewed for adequacy after considering historical loss rates, current economic conditions (both locally and nationally) delinquency trends and charge-off activity, status of past due and non-performing loans, growth within the portfolio, the amount and types of loans comprising the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to pay, the estimated value of underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and any known credit problems that have not been considered elsewhere in the calculation. Although the loan portfolios of the two banks are similar to each other, some differences exist which result in divergent risk patterns and different historical charge-off rates amongst the functional areas of the banks’ loan portfolios. Each bank pays particular attention to the individual loan performance, collateral values, borrower financial condition and economic conditions. A committee, with representatives from both subsidiary banks, meets to discuss the overall economic conditions that impact both subsidiary banks in the same fashion.   The determination of an adequate allowance at each bank is done in a four step process. The first step is to identify impaired loans. Impaired loans are problem loans above a certain threshold which are not expected to perform in accordance with the original loan agreement. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Banks will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the loan’s obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.   Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Banks do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures, unless the loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement.   Impaired loans and their resulting valuation allowance are disclosed in the table below .               December 31, 2011         December 31, 2010                             Identified                       Identified       Loan Type         Balance           Impairment           Balance           Impairment       Commercial mortgage       $ 26,543         $ 1,018         $ 24,147         $ 904       Commercial other         691           167           988           21       Consumer mortgage         1,966           328           253           0               $ 29,200         $ 1,513         $ 25,388         $ 925     The second step is to allocate losses to non-impaired loans based on historical loss rates of loans, by category, and considering the potential impact of other qualitative factors on future loan performance.       18     Table of Contents        Management has determined that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb any losses inherent in the portfolio. Although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary, and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that material increases will not be necessary should the quality of the loans deteriorate as a result of factors previously discussed.   Both banks have outsourced independent loan review performed at least annually, the results of which are reviewed by both bank boards and the Company’s audit committee, with changes factored into the allowance calculations. Independent outsourced loan review considers the adequacy of loan underwriting, asset quality, the accuracy of the banks’ loan risk ratings and the appropriateness of specific reserves as well as the overall reasonableness of the allowance for loan losses.   Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management considers adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Credit exposures deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Recoveries of previously charged-off loans are credited to the allowance for loan losses. During 2011, the Company’s net charge-offs, as compared to gross loan balances, was greater than that experienced in 2010. As a result of the impact of increased net charge-offs, the Company’s provision for loan losses during 2011 was $137,000 greater than in 2010. The Company’s ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans increased from 1.64% at December 31, 2010 to 1.95% at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 71.43% compared to 68.93% at December 31, 2010.   Cumulative net loan losses, after recoveries, for the five-year period ending December 31, 2011 are as follows (in thousands of dollars):                 Dollars           Percent of Total       Commercial       $ 4,066           50 %     Real Estate         2,255           28 %     Consumer         1,771           22 %     Total       $ 8,092                 An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses is set forth in the following table (in thousands of dollars):               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007       Balance at beginning of period       $ 5,407         $ 4,021         $ 3,667         $ 3,577         $ 3,482                                                                         Charge-offs:                                                                 Commercial loans         2,485           849           492           198           540       Real estate loans         565           1,230           445           228           47       Consumer loans         372           668           863           524           494       Total Charge-offs:         3,422           2,747           1,800           950           1,081                                                                         Recoveries:                                                                 Commercial loans         266           144           10           20           59       Real estate loans         15           167           72           2           4       Consumer loans         221           335           208           109           276       Total Recoveries         502           646           290           131           339                                                                         Net Charge-offs         2,920           2,101           1,510           819           742                                                                         Provision for loan losses         3,624           3,487           1,864           909           837                                                                         Balance at end of period       $ 6,111         $ 5,407         $ 4,021         $ 3,667         $ 3,577                                                                         Percent of net charge-offs to average net loans outstanding during the period         .92 %         .63 %         .46 %         .26 %         .24 %       19     Table of Contents        The table below shows the allocation of loans in the loan portfolio and the corresponding amounts of the allowance allocated by loan type (dollar amounts in thousands of dollars):               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007                   Amount         Percent of Loans             Amount         Percent of Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans             Amount         Percent of Loans       Commercial       $ 3,363           32 %       $ 2,232           30 %       $ 1,669           29 %       $ 1,349           30 %       $ 1,140           26 %     Real Estate         1,959           59 %         1,662           61 %         1,034           58 %         994           57 %         1,200           59 %     Consumer         428           9 %         968           9 %         1,220           13 %         1,285           13 %         1,172           15 %     Unallocated         361           0 %         545           0 %         98           0 %         39           0 %         65           0 %     Totals       $ 6,111           100 %       $ 5,407           100 %       $ 4,021           100 %       $ 3,667           100 %       $ 3,577           100 %   As certain loans identified as impaired are paid current, collateral values increase or loans are removed from watch lists for other reasons, and as other loans become identified as impaired, the allocation of the allowance among the loan types may change. The allocation also changes because delinquency levels within each of the respective portfolios change. The Company feels that the allowance is a fair representation of the losses present in the portfolio given historical loss trends, economic conditions and any known credit problems as of any quarter's end. The Company believes that the allowance is to be taken as a whole, and allocation between loan types is an estimation of potential losses within each loan type given information known at the time.    Non-Interest Income   2011 Compared to 2010   Non-interest income increased 0.33%, or $7,000 from 2010 to 2011.   The increase in non-interest income was the result of increase in life insurance investment income in excess of the decreases in overdraft fees, service charge fees, and non-recurring gains on the sale of securities during 2010.   Service charges on deposit accounts decreased 7.57%. The largest portion of these charges is non-sufficient funds fees on non-interest bearing transaction accounts. The subsidiary banks continued to see decreases in service charges associated with the program commonly referred to as the “courtesy overdraft” program. This is the result of customer’s choice not to participate in the subsidiary bank’s automatic overdraft protection coupled with better management, by customers, of their accounts.    Net insurance earnings and commissions decreased $37,000 from 2010 to 2011. Insurance earnings for the Company consist of commissions earned by the subsidiary banks on life and accident and health insurance sold in relation to the extension of credit and insurance revenues, net of benefits paid, expense allowances and policy and claim reserves earned by the life insurance subsidiary. As the Company’s balances of installment loans and the volume of installment loans, which are primary markets for credit life and accident and health insurance, have decreased over the past several years, gross revenues from insurance earnings have decreased. In relation to this decrease, required policy reserves have also declined. The table below illustrates the components of insurance commissions and income for 2010 and 2011 (in thousands of dollars), which is reported as other operating income.                 2011           2010           Increase                                                                                                (Decrease)       Revenues                                         Gross commissions and insurance revenues       $ 123         $ 158         $ (35 )                                               Expenses                                         Benefits Paid         17           8           9       Changes in required policy and claim reserves         (43 )         (55 )         12       Expense allowance         49           68           (19 )     Total Expenses         23           21           (2 )                                               Net insurance income       $ 100         $ 137         $ (37 )       20     Table of Contents        Non-interest Expense   2011 compared to 2010   Non-interest expense increased 0.27% in 2011 as compared to 2010.   Changes in salary and benefits expense   The following table compares the components of salary and benefits expense for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands of dollars):   Salary and Benefits Expense                 2011           2010           Increase                                                                               (Decrease)       Employee salaries       $ 4,450         $ 4,493         $ (43 )     Employee benefit insurance         1,165           1,117           48       Payroll taxes         359           351           8       Deferred loan origination costs         (198 )         0           (198 )     Non-recurring post retirement adjustment         (70 )         0           (70 )     Post retirement plans         719           975           (256 )     Total       $ 6,425         $ 6,936         $ (511 )   The decrease of 7.37% in employee related cost during 2011 compared to 2010 is mainly the result of the implementation of the Financial Accounting Standard ASC 310-20 Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs. The Company began deferral of costs associated with loan origination at the beginning of 2011 and is amortizing the cost over the life of the loan. Additionally, the Company did not contribute to the discretionary employee stock ownership plan or the profit sharing plan during 2011 as part of a cost cutting initiative for 2011 which also included a reduction in director fees paid.   Changes in data processing expense   Data processing expense increased 5.09% or $56,000 during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was driven by a credit received from the Company’s core system vendor during 2010 for an error in billing during the system conversion in the fall of 2009 partially offset by additional costs attributed to increased costs at one of the subsidiary banks as a result of increase in the number of customer deposit accounts, internet banking costs, and a full year of costs during 2011 for a branch location which was not open the full year in 2010.   Changes in occupancy and equipment expense   The following table illustrates the components of occupancy and equipment expense for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands of dollars):                 2011           2010           Increase                                                                                                  (Decrease)       Depreciation of buildings and equipment       $ 783         $ 787         $ (4 )     Maintenance expense on buildings and equipment         344           369           (25 )     Utilities expense         144           133           11       Real estate and personal property tax         105           100           5       Other expense related to occupancy and equipment         107           98           9       Total occupancy and equipment expense       $ 1,483         $ 1,487         $ (4 )   Occupancy and equipment expenses decreased 0.3% during 2011 compared to 2010. Increases in utilities and taxes were offset by decreases in maintenance expenses.   Other changes in non-interest expense   Director fees decreased by 14.43% during 2011 driven by the number of meetings held during 2011 compared to 2010 and a reduction in fees paid to directors per meeting.   Legal and professional fees decreased by $95,000 or 15.73% from 2010 to 2011 driven by non-recurring legal expenses incurred during 2010 and a reduction in third party internal audit fees compared to 2010.       21     Table of Contents        Office supplies and postage and freight expenses decreased 14.99% or $61,000 during 2011 compared to 2010, largely driven by the reduction of courier services between branches.   FDIC premium expense decreased 21.45% or $142,000 during 2011 compared to 2010 driven by the decreased premiums rates adjusted by the FDIC during 2011.   Loan and foreclosed asset expenses increased 153.35% or $871,000 during 2011 compared to 2010 due to the increased number of foreclosures during 2011, valuation adjustments on foreclosed properties, and increased costs associated with obtaining updated appraisals on impaired relationships.   The table below illustrates components of other non-interest expense for 2011 and 2010 (in thousands of dollars). Significant other non-interest expense are in the following table:                 2011           2010           Increase                                                                             (Decrease)       ATM expense       $ (109 )       $ (72 )       $ (37 )     Advertising and marketing expense         150           158           (8 )     Amortization of intangible assets         187           190           (3 )     Franchise taxes         116           96           20       Miscellaneous components of other     non-interest expense         590           584           6       Total       $ 934         $ 956         $ (22 )   Securities Portfolio   The Company’s securities portfolio serves several purposes. Portions of the portfolio are used to secure certain public deposits. The remaining portfolio is held as investments or used to assist the Company in liquidity and asset liability management. Total securities, including restricted securities, represented 10.22% of total assets and 99.10% of total shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011.   The securities portfolio typically will consist of three components: securities held to maturity, securities available for sale and restricted securities. Securities are classified as held to maturity when management has the intent and the Company has the ability at the time of purchase to hold the securities to maturity. Held to maturity securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and accounted for at market value. Securities available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security's prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, general liquidity needs and other similar factors. Restricted securities are those investments purchased as a requirement of membership in certain governmental lending institutions and cannot be transferred without the issuer’s permission. The Company's purchases of securities have generally been limited to securities of high credit quality with short to medium term maturities.   The Company identifies at the time of acquisition those securities that are available for sale. These securities are valued at their market value with any difference in market value and amortized cost shown as an adjustment in stockholders' equity. Changes within the year in market values are reflected as changes in other comprehensive income, net of the deferred tax effect. As of December 31, 2011, the fair value of the securities available for sale exceeds their cost basis by $430,000 ($271,000 after tax effect of $159,000).   The table below summarizes the carrying value of the Company’s securities at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands of dollars):               Available for Sale               Carrying Value               December 31,               2011         2010         2009       U.S. Treasuries and Agencies       $ 21,932         $ 9,258         $ 12,426       Mortgage backed securities         5,604           5,651           5,836       Collateralized mortgage obligations         3,413           1,764           0       State and municipals         2,698           2,157           3,946       Certificates of deposit         5,910           6,465           4,703       Marketable equities         0           29           25       Total       $ 39,557         $ 25,324         $ 26,936         22     Table of Contents         The carrying amount and estimated market value of securities (in thousands of dollars) at December 31, 2011 by contractual maturity are shown below.

It is the Company’s determination that all securities held at December 31, 2011 which have fair values less than the amortized cost, have these gross unrealized losses related to increases in the current interest rates for similar issues of securities, and that no material impairment for any securities in the portfolio exists because of downgrades of the securities or as a result of a change in the financial condition of any of the issuers. A summary of the length of time of unrealized losses for all securities held at December 31, 2011 can be found in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company reviews all securities with unrealized losses, and all securities in the portfolio on a regular basis to determine whether the potential for other than temporary impairment exists. One of the criteria for making this determination is the rating given to each bond by the major ratings agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poors.   A summary of the Company’s securities portfolio at December 31, 2011, based on the ratings of the securities in the portfolio given by these ratings agencies, is shown below (in thousands of dollars):                 Amortized                                                                                      Cost           Gross Unrealized                                                                                      Gains           Gross                                                                                      Unrealized Losses           Market                                                                                      Value     Ratings Provided by Ratings Agencies                                                     Moody’s       S&P                                                                                                               U.S. Treasuries and Agencies                                                        Aaa     AA+       $ 17,655         $ 158         $ 4         $ 17,809          No Rating     No Rating         4,086           37           0           4,123                                                                     Mortgage Backed Securities                                                  MBS Agency     MBS Agency         5,456           151         $ 3           5,604                                                                     Commercial Mortgage Obligations                                                        MBS Agency MBS Agency        3,387          37          11          3,413                                                                     State and Municipals                                                  Aa3      AA-         951            43            0            994            Aa2     AA         1,094           9           0           1,103     No Rating     AA-         402           4           0           406     No Rating     No Rating         195           0           0           195            23     Table of Contents        Deposits   The Company’s primary source of funds is local deposits. The Company's deposit base is comprised of demand deposits, savings and money market accounts and other time deposits. The majority of the Company's deposits are provided by individuals and businesses located within the communities served.   Total balances of deposits increased 0.4% from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011.    A summary of the maturity range of time deposits over $100,000 is as follows (in thousands of dollars):               At December 31,               2011         2010         2009       Three months or less       $ 10,472         $ 11,725         $ 11,133       Four to twelve months         32,040           36,431           36,512       One year to three years         22,066           22,419           23,447       Four years to five years         9,534           4,428           4,504       Total       $ 74,112         $ 75,003         $ 75,596     Debt Instruments   Long-Term Borrowings   The Company borrows funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) to reduce market rate risks or to provide operating liquidity. The Company typically will initiate these borrowings in response to a specific need for managing market risks or for a specific liquidity need and will attempt to match features of these borrowings to best suit the specific need. Therefore, the borrowings on the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 and throughout the twelve month period ended December 31, 2011 have varying features of amortization or single payment with periodic, regular interest payment and also have interest rates which vary based on the terms and on the features of the specific borrowing. More information regarding the Company’s FHLB advances can be found in Note Thirteen of the consolidated financial statements.   Short-Term Borrowings   As it becomes necessary for short-term liquidity needs and when beneficial for assisting in managing profitability the Company will periodically utilize either the FHLB or other available credit facilities for overnight or other short term borrowings. The use of short-term debt instruments is not a frequently utilized borrowing mechanism of the Company; however, during the third quarter of 2010, circumstances prescribed use of these borrowing facilities. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no balance in overnight and other short-term borrowings.    Capital Resources   The assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality, liquidity, earnings performance and changing competitive conditions and economic forces. The Company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support growth and expansion activities, to provide stability to current operations, and to promote public confidence.   The Company’s capital position continues to exceed regulatory minimums. The primary indicators relied on by the Federal Reserve Board and other bank regulators in measuring strength of capital position are the Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Leverage ratios. Tier 1 Capital consists of common stockholders' equity adjusted for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Total Capital consists of Tier 1 Capital and a portion of the allowance for loan losses. Risk-based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk-weighted assets, which consist of both on and off-balance sheet risks.   The capital management function is an ongoing process. The Company looks first and foremost to maintain capital levels adequate to satisfy regulatory requirements through earnings retention. The maintenance of capital adequacy is weighed against the management of capital for satisfactory return on equity, typically via use of dividends and/or share repurchases. During 2011, the Company’s capital position increased $306,000 versus the decrease of $54,000 during 2010. The return on average equity was 3.41% in 2011 compared to 4.00% for 2010. Total cash dividends declared represented 43.25% of net income for 2011 compared to 87.39% for 2010. Book value per share was $31.17 at December 31, 2011 compared to $30.94 at December 31, 2010.        24     Table of Contents        Liquidity   Operating liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Short-term liquidity is provided primarily through cash balances, deposits with other financial institutions, federal funds sold, non-pledged securities and loans maturing within one year. Additional sources of liquidity available to the Company include, but are not limited to, loan repayments, the ability to obtain deposits through the adjustment of interest rates and the purchasing of federal funds. To further meet its liquidity needs, the Company also maintains lines of credit with correspondent financial institutions, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.    Historically, the Company’s primary need for additional levels of operational liquidity has been to fund increases in loan balances. The Company has normally funded increases in loans by increasing deposits and balances of borrowed funds and decreases in secondary liquidity sources such as balances of federal funds sold and balances of securities. The Company maintains credit facilities which are typically sufficient to adequately fulfill any short-term liquidity needs, and management of deposit balances and long term borrowings are utilized for longer term liquidity management. Increases in liquidity requirements may cause the Company to offer above market rates on deposit products to attract new depositors, which would impact the Company’s net interest income.   The Company’s operating funds, funds with which to pay shareholder dividends and funds for the exploration of new business ventures have been supplied primarily through dividends paid by the Company’s two subsidiary Banks, Capon Valley Bank and The Grant County Bank. The various regulatory authorities impose restrictions on dividends paid by a state bank. A state bank cannot pay dividends without the consent of the relevant banking authorities in excess of the total net profits of the current year and the combined retained profits of the previous two years. As of December 31, 2011, the subsidiary Banks could pay dividends to the Company of approximately $3,307,000 without permission of the regulatory authorities.   Effects of Inflation   Inflation primarily affects industries having high levels of property, plant and equipment or inventories. Although the Company is not significantly affected in these areas, inflation does have an impact on the growth of assets. As assets grow rapidly, it becomes necessary to increase equity capital at proportionate levels to maintain the appropriate equity to asset ratios. Traditionally, the Company’s earnings and high capital retention levels have enabled the Company to meet these needs.   The Company’s reported earnings results have been minimally affected by inflation. The different types of income and expense are affected in various ways. Interest rates are affected by inflation, but the timing and magnitude of the changes may not coincide with changes in the consumer price index. The Company actively monitors interest rate sensitivity in order to minimize the effects of inflationary trends on interest rates. Other areas of non-interest expenses may be more directly affected by inflation.   Item7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     52 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .   Overview   Minden Bancorp is a Louisiana-chartered holding company which owns 100% of the capital stock of MBL Bank, a community oriented building and loan association headquartered in Minden, Louisiana. Our primary business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate loans to our customers and invest in securities such as United States (“U.S.”) Government and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal obligations. At December 31, 2011, Minden Bancorp had total assets of $264.6 million, total deposits of $223.7 million and stockholders’ equity of $39.0 million.   We are primarily engaged in attracting deposits from the general public through our two banking offices and using such deposits primarily to (i) originate loans secured by first liens on single-family (one-to four-units) residential and commercial real estate properties as well as to originate land and commercial business loans and (ii) invest in securities issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, municipal securities and certain mutual funds. Minden Bancorp derives its income principally from interest earned on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments and, to a lesser extent, from fees received in connection with the origination of loans and for other services. Minden Bancorp’s primary expenses are interest expense on deposits and general operating expenses. Funds for activities are provided primarily by deposits, repayments and prepayments of outstanding loans, investments and mortgage-backed securities and other sources.   MBL Bank is subject to regulation by the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions, as its chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which also insures MBL Bank’s deposits up to applicable legal limits.   Certain highlights of our operating strategy are:                        Emphasizing Commercial Real Estate, Commercial Business and Land Loans. At December 31, 2011, $47.2 million or 35.1% of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. In addition, at December 31, 2011 we had $13.8 million of land loans, most of which are secured by income producing properties such as timber or agricultural property. Commercial real estate and commercial business loans as well as land loans are attractive because they generally provide us with higher average yields than single-family residential mortgage loans and they typically have adjustable rates of interest and/or shorter terms to maturity than traditional single-family residential mortgage loans. The net proceeds from the second-step conversion offering completed in January 2011 increased our capital (although prior to the conversion MBL Bank maintained regulatory capital in excess of “well capitalized” standards), which will facilitate our ability to expand high quality loan relationships, subject to our current underwriting guidelines. We intend to continue to emphasize growth of our commercial real estate, commercial business and land lending in a manner consistent with our stringent loan underwriting policies and procedures . At December 31, 2011, we had no non-performing commercial real estate loans, one non-performing commercial business loan and one non-performing land loan with a principal balance at such date of $19,000 and $4,000, respectively.                                              Increasing Core Deposits. We will continue our efforts to increase our core deposits in order to help reduce and control our cost of funds. As part of our emphasis on developing commercial banking relationships, we have emphasized the expansion of non-interest checking accounts which comprised $37.9 million or 16.9% of our total deposit portfolio at December 31, 2011. We offer a wide variety of deposits to our customers and are competitive in the rates we offer although we do not necessarily seek to match the highest rates paid by competitors. We also promote longer term deposits where possible and consistent with our asset liability management goals.                                               Expanding our Market Presence . We are taking steps to increase our market penetration in our existing market area by expanding the products and services we offer while continuing to emphasize customer service in an effort to capture more of each customer’s banking relationships. In addition to organic growth, we continue to evaluate market expansion opportunities. The net proceeds from the offering will facilitate our ability to consider additional new offices, either on a de novo basis or through acquisitions, although we currently have no plans, agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions.       39     Table of Contents                             Emphasizing Business Banking Operations. We have increased our contacts with local businesses in an effort to increase our business banking relationships and as a continuation of our transformation to a community bank. As a locally based bank, we believe that we offer a high level of customer service and an efficient loan application and approval process which is attractive to many local, small to medium sized businesses.                                              New Product Lines.  MBL Bank now offers credit cards (on an agency basis) and ACH originations. We continue to evaluate new product lines and services in our effort to offer a broader array of products and services to our customers. In particular, we continue to evaluate financial products which will increase our non-interest income.                                              Continuing Residential Mortgage Lending. Historically, we were a traditional single-family residential mortgage lender, and we will continue to offer traditional single-family residential loan products. For the past several years, we have emphasized originating such loans with balloon payments after three to five years and/or with shorter amortization periods and terms. At December 31, 2011, our loans secured by single-family residential mortgages amounted to $54.9 million, or 40.8% of our total loan portfolio.                         Our results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on our loan and securities portfolios and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Our net interest income is largely determined by our net interest spread, which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses, fees and service charges and other non-interest income and non-interest expense. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, advertising and other expense. Our results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.   Our net income amounted to $2.6 million and $2.3 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Some of the major factors and trends which have impacted our results in these periods include the following:                        Low Market Rates of Interest. In recent periods, our results have benefitted from the historically low market rates of interest that have prevailed. During 2008, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the federal funds rate seven times from 4.25% at December 31, 2007 to a range of 0% to 0.25% at December 31, 2008 and throughout 2009, 2010 and 2011. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated recently that it expects the federal funds rate to remain at the current low level through at least mid-2013. The average rates that we pay on our interest-bearing deposits and other liabilities have fallen steadily, from 4.21% for the year ended December 31, 2007 to 0.86% during the year ended December 31, 2011. Because the average rates on our deposits and other liabilities tend to adjust to changes in market rates of interest more quickly than the average yields we earn on our loans and other interest-earning assets, our average interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average cost paid on interest-bearing liabilities) increased between 2007 and 2011, as has our net interest income. We anticipate that the current low rate environment will continue to put downward pressure on short term interest rates until the economic recovery is sustainable. However, when the interest rate environment begins to increase it will cause pricing pressure on our deposit accounts and may have a negative impact on our net income.        40     Table of Contents                             Managing Other Expenses. Our other, or non-interest, expenses amounted to $4.5 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We have been able to maintain the level of our non-interest expenses through implementation of stringent cost controls resulting in only modest increases in most of our areas of non-interest expense . Salary and employee benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $205,000 over the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of employees, salary increases, the purchase by our employee stock ownership plan of additional shares in the second-step conversion offering as well as the new stock benefit plans implemented.    Critical Accounting Policies   In reviewing and understanding financial information for Minden Bancorp, you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These policies are described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting and financial reporting policies of Minden Bancorp conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. The following accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported consolidated financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and financial condition for the period or in future periods.   Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Charges against the allowance for loan losses are made when management believes that the collectibility of loan principal is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance. The allowance is an amount that management believes will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans. The evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the types and amount of loans in the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans, and current economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including, among others, exposure at default, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios and general amounts for historical loss experience. All of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change.   While management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance evaluations, adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions or changes in accounting guidance. Historically, our estimates of the allowance for loan losses have not required significant adjustments from management’s initial estimates. In addition, the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as an integral part of their examination processes, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The Louisiana Office of Financial Institution and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from management’s estimates, additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.   Income Taxes. We make estimates and judgments to calculate some of our tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of some of our deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses. We also estimate a deferred tax asset valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. These estimates and judgments are inherently subjective. Historically, our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision to our initial estimates.     41     Table of Contents        In evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, recent cumulative losses and our forecast of future taxable income. In determining future taxable income, we make assumptions for the amount of taxable income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings.   Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) whether or not we intend to sell or expect that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to an anticipated recovery in fair value. Once a decline in value for a debt security is determined to be other-than-temporary, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated into (a) the amount of total other-than-temporary impairment related to a decrease in cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security (the credit loss) and (b) the amount of other-than-temporary impairment related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of other-than-temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).       42     Table of Contents        Financial Condition     Changes in Financial Condition at December 31, 2011 Compared to December 31, 2010   Total assets increased $16.8 million or 6.8% to $264.6 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $247.8 million at December 31, 2010. This increase primarily reflected a $3.7 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, a $10.4 million or 16.6% increase in investment securities and a $4.3 million or 3.4% increase in net loans. The increase in loans reflected our continued emphasis on loan originations. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we originated a total of $95.7 million of loans, including $16.6 million of single-family residential, $29.7 million of commercial real estate loans, $16.0 million of commercial business loans and $11.4 million of non-real estate consumer loans, partially offset by $86.3 million of loan repayments. MBL Bank remains committed to continuing its lending emphasis on developing and growing new and existing relationships with both retail and commercial customers within its primary market area.   Total liabilities increased $2.0 million or 0.86% to $225.6 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $223.6 million at December 31, 2010. This increase was due to a $11.6 million or 5.5% increase in deposits partially offset by the transfer into equity of $10.2 million of subscription funds deposited by subscribers in 2010 to purchase shares of common stock in the second-step conversion offering which was completed in January 2011.   Stockholders’ equity increased $14.9 million to $39.0 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $24.1 million at December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to the $12.9 million net increase as result of the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock of the Company issued in the second-step conversion combined with a $2.6 million increase due to profitable operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 and a $127,000 increase in accumulated other comprehensive income reflecting an increase in unrealized gains related to investment securities available for sale as a result of the increase in the market value thereof since December 31, 2010. The increase was partially offset by dividends paid of $467,000 and the purchase of shares for the Company’s Recognition and Retention Plan.   Non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings, which consist of nonaccruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent, troubled debt restructurings, and real estate owned (which includes real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, foreclosure), increased by $603,000 to $1.1 million or 0.4% of total assets at December 31, 2011 from $536,000 or 0.2% of total assets at December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily due to a $681,000 increase in troubled debt restructurings, and a $51,000 increase in accruing loans 90 or more days past due, partially offset by a decrease of $136,000 in nonaccrual single-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2011, the $436,000 of non-performing assets consisted of $88,000 of accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent, $338,000 of nonaccrual loans and $10,000 in other repossessed assets, consisting of one automobile. At December 31, 2011, the $338,000 of nonaccrual loans consisted primarily of single-family residential mortgage loans. Management continues to aggressively pursue the collection and resolution of all delinquent loans. In addition, we had at December 31, 2011 one $703,000 non-residential real estate loan deemed a troubled restructuring which is on an accrual basis due to its continued performance in accordance with its modified terms for more than six months. See “Item 1 - Business - Asset Quality.”    MBL Bank strives to maintain current valuations of the collateral supporting its impaired loans as well as other real estate owned. In most cases, we utilize third-party appraisals to determine the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral when measuring for impairment. As part of our valuation analysis, management considers the timing and reliability of the original appraisal, the original loan-to-value, our overall exposure and current market conditions. As part of our analysis, discounts may be applied to any collateral valuations that were performed more than one year prior to the reporting date.   At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses amounted to $1.6 million and $1.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the allowance for loan losses amounted to 381.5% of non-performing loans and 1.2 % of total loans receivable, as compared to 255.2% and 1.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2010.       43     Table of Contents        Although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provisions for loan losses, additional provisions for loan losses may be required to be established in the future should economic or other conditions change substantially. In addition, the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to such allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.        44     Table of Contents        Average Balances, Net Interest Income, Yields Earned and Rates Paid.

The following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected our interest income and expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in rate, which is the change in rate multiplied by prior year volume, and (2) changes in volume, which is the change in volume multiplied by prior year rate. The combined effect of changes in both rate and volume has been allocated proportionately to the change due to rate and the change due to volume.               Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to 2010         Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to 2009               Increase (Decrease) Due to         Increase (Decrease) Due to               Rate         Volume         Total Increase (Decrease)         Rate         Volume         Total Increase (Decrease)               (In thousands)       Interest income:                                                                             Loans receivable       $ (82 )       $ 328         $ 246         $ (286 )       $ 473         $ 187       Investment securities         (306 )         288           (18 )         (120 )         (16 )         (136 )     Other interest-earning assets         (13 )         40           27           (60 )         87           27       Total interest income         (401 )         656           255           (466 )         544           78       Interest expense:                                                                             Savings, NOW and money market accounts	         (205 )         44           (161 )         (228 )         102           (126 )     Certificates of deposit         (285 )         111           (174 )         (568 )         91           (477 )     Total deposits         (490 )         155           (335 )         (796 )         193           (603 )     FHLB advances and other borrowings         —           —           —           —           —           —       Total interest expense         (490 )         155           (335 )         (796 )         193           (603 )     Increase (decrease) in net interest income       $ 89         $ 501         $ 590         $ 330         $ 351         $ 681       Results of Operations   Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010   General . We recorded net income of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to net income of $2.3 million in 2010.   Net interest income increased $590,000 or 8.3% to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010, primarily due to a $255,000 increase in interest income and a $335,000 decrease in interest expense. The increase in interest income reflected the continued growth of our loan and investment portfolios offset by the re-pricing downward of such portfolios as a result of the decline in interest rates and yields. The decrease in interest expense is a reflection of the continued re-pricing downward of our deposit liabilities resulting from the decline in interest rates.  Other operating income increased $385,000 or 48.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 2010. Other operating income for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects modest increases in customer service fees as we continued to emphasize the development of relationship banking. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2011 also reflected a net gain on sale of assets of $212,000 as compared to $5,000 for 2010. Non-interest expenses increased by $419,000 or 10.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a $205,000 increase in salary and benefit expense and a modest $214,000 increase in all other general and administrative expenses. The provision for loan losses was $370,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.       46     Table of Contents        Net Interest Income. Net interest income is determined by our interest rate spread (i.e., the difference between the yields earned on our interest-earning assets and the rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities) and the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased $590,000 or 8.3% to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This increase was primarily due to a decrease in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits combined with a $246,000 increase in interest earned on loans receivable offset in part by reductions in interest income on investment securities. The decline in interest expense was primarily the result of the decline in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities which more than offset the $ 14.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits as we funded our asset growth through deposits other rather than borrowings.   Interest Income.  Interest income increased $255,000 or 2.9% to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $246,000 or 3.2% increase in interest earned on loans and a $9,000 increase in interest earned on investment securities and other interest-earning assets. The increase in interest income on loans was primarily due to a $5.2 million or 4.2% increase in the average balance of loans outstanding as we continued our growth strategy, which increase more than offset the 52 basis point decline in the average yield reflecting the decline in market rates of interest. The decrease in interest earned on investment securities reflected a 47 basis point decline in the yield partially offset by a $13 million or 25.5% increase in the average balance.     Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $335,000 or 18.2% to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 2010. This was due to a decrease of $161,000 or 35.9% in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits and savings and a decrease of $174 ,000 or 12.5% in interest expense on certificates of deposit. The decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit was primarily due to a 34 basis point or 18.7% decrease in the average rate paid, which was partially offset by a $6.1 million or 8.0% increase in the average balance outstanding. In addition, a further reduction in our cost of funds was due to the decrease in interest paid on transaction accounts of $161,000 or 35.9% which reflected primarily the effect of the 22 basis point decline in the average rate paid to 0.31% offset in part by the $8.5 million increase in the average balance as we pursued funding our asset growth with low cost core deposits.   Provision for Loan Losses. We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to operations, to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which will cover known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio, based upon an assessment of prior loss experience, the volume and type of lending conducted, industry standards, past due loans, economic conditions in our market area and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. The provision for loan losses amounted to $370,000 for both the year ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.   The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management’s periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. The evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.   A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information or events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. When a loan is impaired, the measurement of such impairment is based upon the fair value of the collateral of the loan. If the fair value of the collateral is less than the recorded investment in the loan, we will recognize the impairment by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge against earnings.   Non-Interest Income. Total other operating income increased $385,000 or 48.4% from $795,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $1.2 million for fiscal 2011. The year ended December 31, 2011 reflected a 20% increase in customer service fees as we continued to emphasize the development of relationship banking. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2011 also reflected a net gain on sale of assets of $212,000 as compared to $5,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The gain was primarily from the sale of securities.   Non-Interest Expenses. Our non-interest expenses amounted to $4.5 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase was primarily due to a $205,000 increase in salary and benefit expense and a modest $214,000 increase with respect to all other operating expenses.        47     Table of Contents        Income Tax Expense. We incurred income tax expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to the increase in income before income taxes for 2011. Our effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 34.0% for 2011 and 2010.   Exposure to Changes in Interest Rates   Our ability to maintain net interest income depends upon our ability to earn a higher yield on interest-earning assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings. The Company’s interest-earning assets consist primarily of longer term residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans and investment securities available for sale which have fixed rates of interest. Consequently, our ability to maintain a positive spread between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings can be adversely affected when market rates of interest rise.   Although longer term, fixed-rate mortgage loans made up a significant portion of our interest-earning assets at December 31, 2011, we maintained a significant portfolio of securities available-for-sale during the past few years. We continue to structure an increased number of loans to include balloon payments due in three to five years or with shorter terms in order to better position us for a rising rate environment. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, securities available-for-sale amounted to $73.0 million and $62.4 million, respectively, or 27.6% and 25.2%, respectively, of total assets at such dates. In addition, at December 31, 2011, 72.8% of our loan portfolio was comprised of loans with either balloon payments due in five years or less or with terms of five years or less. Pursuing this strategy will allow our interest-earning assets to reprice more rapidly in a rising interest rate environment.    Quantitative Analysis. MBL Bank obtains a quarterly report on the potential impact of interest rate changes upon the market value of portfolio equity. Management reviews the quarterly reports which show the impact of changing interest rates on net portfolio value. Net portfolio value is the difference between incoming and outgoing discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts.   Net Portfolio Value. Our interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through the use of a model which internally generates estimates of the change in our net portfolio value (“NPV”) over a range of interest rate scenarios. NPV is the present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet contracts. The NPV ratio, under any interest rate scenario, is defined as the NPV in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario. The following table sets forth our NPV as of December 31, 2011:       Change in Interest Rates in Basis Points (Rate Shock)       Net Portfolio Value         NPV as % of Portfolio Value of Assets             Amount         $ Change         % Change         NPV Ratio         Change               (Dollars in thousands)       300       $ 42,431         $ 897           2 %         15.61 %         37 BP      200         42,634           1,100           3           15.65           41       100         42,443           909           2           15.56           32       Static         41,534           —           —           15.24           —       (50)         40,415           (1,119 )         (3 )         14.88           (36 )     (100)         39,951           (1,583 )         (4 )         14.74           (50 )   Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in NPV requires the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the NPV simulation model above provides an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such model is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.       48     Table of Contents          Qualitative Analysis.  Our ability to maintain a positive “spread” between the interest earned on assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is affected by changes in interest rates. Our fixed-rate loans generally are profitable if interest rates are stable or declining since these loans have yields that exceed our cost of funds. If interest rates increase, however, we would have to pay more on our deposits and new borrowings, if any, which would adversely affect our interest rate spread. In order to counter the potential effects of dramatic increases in market rates of interest, we have for the past several years frequently structured our mortgage loans to provide for balloon payments of the principal due after three or five years as well as pursued the origination of loans with shorter terms such as commercial business loans and land loans. In addition, commencing in 2010 we began originating for sale those single-family loans with terms of 15 years or greater. As a result, we are not as susceptible to rising interest rates as we would be if our interest-earning assets were primarily comprised of long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans. Interest rate floors limit our interest rate risk by limiting potential decreases in the interest yield on an adjustable-rate loan to a certain level. As a result, we receive a minimum yield even if rates decline farther and the interest rate on the particular loan would otherwise adjust to a lower amount. Conversely, interest rate ceilings limit the amount by which the yield on an adjustable-rate loan may increase to no more than six percentage points over the rate at the time of origination. Finally, we intend to continue to emphasize the origination on shorter term consumer loans and commercial business loans which generally have terms of five years or less and/or bear adjustable rates.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   We maintain levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.   Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales and earnings and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. Our deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to $900,000 and $422,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.   A significant portion of our liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities and increases in deposit accounts. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, we have borrowing agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas which provide an additional source of funds. At December 31, 2011, we did not have any advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had $82.8 million in borrowing capacity.   At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding commitments to originate loans totaling $4.2 million. At December 31, 2011, certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year, totaled $ 66.2 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal, in a rising interest rate environment. We intend to utilize our high levels of liquidity to fund our lending activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, we intend to sell our securities classified as available-for-sale as needed.   MBL Bank is required to maintain regulatory capital sufficient to meet tangible, core and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 1.5%, 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively. At December 31, 2011, MBL Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with ratios of 12.3 %, 12.3% and 27.3%, respectively, and was deemed “well-capitalized” for regulatory capital purposes.       49     Table of Contents        Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations   The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, consisting solely of certificates of deposit, at December 31, 2011.               Total at         Payments Due By Period               December 31, 2011         To 1 Year         1-3 Years         4-5 Years         After 5 Years               (In thousands)       Certificates of deposit       $ 84,861         $ 66,245         $ 18,616         $ —         $ —       Total contractual obligations       $ 84,861         $ 66,245         $ 18,616         $ —         $ —     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements    In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments, lines of credit and letters of credit.   The following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans and to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding letters of credit, lines of credit and undisbursed construction loans in process at December 31, 2011.               Total Amounts Committed at         Amount of Commitment Expiration - Per Period               December 31, 2011         To 1 Year         1-3 Years         4-5 Years         After 5 Years               (In thousands)       Letters of credit       $ 135         $ 135         $ —         $ —         $ —       Unused lines of credit         8,567           7,507           1,060           —           —       Undisbursed portion of loans in process         1,518           1,518           —           —           —       Commitments to originate loans         4,181           4,181           —           —           —       Total commitments       $ 14,401         $ 13,341         $ 1,060         $ —         $ —     Recent Accounting Pronouncements    International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)   In November 2009, the SEC issued a proposed roadmap regarding the potential use by U.S. issuers of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. IFRS is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). Under the proposed roadmap, the Company may be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS as early as 2014. The SEC is expected to make a determination in 2012 regarding the mandatory adoption of IFRS. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this potential change would have on its operating results and financial condition, and will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of IFRS.        50     Table of Contents        Accounting Standards Updates   In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (‘ASU’) No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements . ASU 2010-06 amends Subtopic 820-10 with new disclosure requirements and clarification of existing disclosure requirements. New disclosures required include the amount of significant transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers. In addition, the reconciliation for level 3 activity will be required on a gross rather than net basis, The ASU provides additional guidance related to the level of disaggregation in determining classes of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. The amendments were effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the reconciliation for level 3 activities on a gross basis which were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010.   In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310): Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses , which require the Company to provide new disclosures in its financial statements to improve the transparency of financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures about the Company’s allowance for credit losses as well as the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio. The additional disclosures required are incorporated in these audited consolidated financial statements.   In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-01, Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. 2010-20 . ASU 2011-01 temporarily delayed the effective date of the disclosures surrounding troubled debt restructurings in ASU 2010-20 for public companies. The effective date of the new disclosures is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2011.   In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-02, A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring . ASU 2011-02 provides clarification on guidance on a creditor’s evaluation of whether it has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. The effective date for ASU 2011-02 was for the first interim and annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011.   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement . ASU 2011-04 amends the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in order to gain consistency between the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and the International Financial Reporting Standards. The effective date for ASU 2011-04 is for the first interim and annual period beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.   In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income . ASU 2011-05 requires entities to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate consecutive statements. The effective date for ASU 2011-05 is for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-05 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. It will present a change in disclosure as the Company currently presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statement of changes in shareholder’s equity.   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-09, Compensation Retirement Benefits -- Multi-employer Plans . ASU 2011-09 requires entities to provide additional separate disclosures for multi-employer pension plans and multi-employer other post-retirement benefit plans. This update is intended to provide users with more detailed information about an employer’s involvement in multi-employer pension plans. The effective date for ASU 2011-09 is for annual periods for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this accounting standard did not have an impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.   In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The effective date for ASU 2011-11 is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods with those annual periods. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.       51     Table of Contents        In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 201I-05 . ASU 2011-12 defers certain changes in ASU 2011-05 relating to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The effective date for ASU 2011-12 is for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011.   Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices   The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does the effect of inflation.   Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk     45 ITEM 7 – MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the selected financial data appearing in Item 1, Business, and the financial statements and notes thereto appearing in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview The Company is the holding company for Valley Business Bank, a California state chartered bank.  The Company’s principal business is to provide, through its banking subsidiary, financial services in its primary market area in California. The Company serves Tulare and Fresno Counties and the surrounding area through the Bank. The Company derives its income primarily from interest earned on loans, and, to a lesser extent, interest on investment securities, fees for services provided to deposit customers, and fees from the brokerage of loans. The Bank’s major operating expenses are the interest paid on deposits and borrowings, and general operating expenses, including salaries and employee benefits and, to a lesser extent, occupancy and equipment, data processing and operations. The Company does not currently conduct any operations other than through the Bank. Critical Accounting Policies The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The Company’s accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported. The most complex of these accounting policies require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. The Company has established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and consistently applied from period to period. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The accounting areas where management’s judgment is most likely to materially impact the Company’s financial results are: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) is maintained to provide for estimated credit losses that it is probable the Company will incur as of the balance sheet date. Loans determined to be impaired are evaluated individually by management for determination of the specific loss, if any, that exists as of the balance sheet date. In addition, reserve factors are assigned to currently performing loans by loan type based on historical loss rates and adjusted for various qualitative factors such as economic and market conditions, concentrations and other trends within the loan portfolio. When management believes that additional reserves are needed, the ALLL is increased by recording a charge to operations through the provision for loan losses. The ALLL is decreased as loans are charged-off, net of recoveries. Management believes the ALLL is a “critical accounting estimate” because management’s estimate of loan losses on loans not already identified as impaired; i.e., loans that are currently performing, requires management to carefully evaluate the pertinent facts and circumstances as of the balance sheet date to determine how much, if any, adjustment is required to the historical loss rate for each loan type. In addition, estimates of loan losses on currently performing loans are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change. For example, a continued decline in the California real estate market may result in management raising its estimate of loan losses if such estimated losses are considered probable at the balance sheet date. Furthermore, the FDIC and California Department of Financial Institutions, as an integral part of their examination process, review the ALLL. These agencies may require additions to the ALLL based on their judgment about information at the time of their examinations. Management reviews the adequacy of the ALLL at least quarterly. Further information is provided in the “Provision for Loan Losses” and “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” sections of this discussion and analysis. Available-for-Sale-Securities. Available-for-sale securities are required to be carried at fair value. Management believes this is a “critical accounting estimate” in that the fair value of a security is based on unadjusted quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available, fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders’ equity.        27     Table of Contents        At least quarterly and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation, investment securities are evaluated for impairment to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other than temporary. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, and we do not intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit exposure is recognized as a charge to earnings, with the balance recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income. If management intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its forecasted cost, the entire impairment loss is recognized as a charge to earnings.   Income Taxes. The Company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary. The allocation of income tax expense (benefit) represents each entity's proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Management believes this is a “critical accounting estimate” in that an estimate of future earnings is required to support its position that the benefit of the Company’s deferred tax assets will be realized. If future income should prove non-existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied, the asset may not be realized and the Company’s net income will be reduced. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.  Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.   Results of Operations Overview The Company had net income of $3.1 million, or $0.97 earnings per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to net income of $2.2 million, or $0.65 earnings per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company had a net loss of $587,000, or $(0.34) loss per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The return (loss) on average assets was 0.90% for 2011, 0.63% for 2010, and (0.18)% for 2009. The return (loss) on average shareholders’ equity for 2011, 2010, and 2009 was 7.63%, 5.68%, and (1.53)%, respectively. The increase in earnings for 2011 resulted from a $1.5 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, from $2.1 million in 2010 to $600,000 in 2011. Net interest income increased by $384,000 primarily due to decreases in cost of deposits and borrowings. Non-interest income increased by $219,000 due to increases in gains from the sale of investment securities of $290,000 in 2011 compared to $34,000 in 2010. The Company’s non-interest expense increased by $478,000 in 2011 due primarily to a $431,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits. The ratio of non-interest expense to net operating revenue (efficiency ratio) deteriorated slightly to 66.0% for 2011 when compared to 65.5% for 2010, and 64.9% for 2009. This ratio reflects changes in non-interest expense as well as changes in revenue from interest and non-interest sources.       28     Table of Contents      At December 31, 2011, the Company’s total assets were $366.5 million, an increase of $25.1 million or 7% compared to December 31, 2010. Total loans, net of the ALLL, were $224.5 million at December 31, 2011, representing a decrease of $9.8 million or 4% compared to December 31, 2010. Total deposits increased $21.6 million or 7% from $294.3 at December 31, 2010 to $315.9 million at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2011, the Company’s Leverage ratio was 13.1% while its Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios were 17.6% and 18.9%, respectively. The Leverage, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios at December 31, 2010 were 12.1%, 16.2% and 17.5%, respectively. The increase in the Company’s capital ratios in 2011 resulted from 2011 earnings offset by the dividends paid on preferred stock.

taxable-equivalent basis by using a marginal tax rate of 34%.   (2) Nonaccrual loans are included in total loans. Interest income is included on nonaccrual loans only to the extent cash payments have been received. There was $209, $315 and $37 interest received on a cash basis in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There was $135 and $22 interest income reversed on nonaccrual loans for 2011 and 2010, respectively. There was no interest income reversed on nonaccrual loans during 2009. (3) Interest income includes net amortized loan fees of $513, $564, and $619 for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.     29     Table of Contents      The following table sets forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense from changes in average earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities (volume) and changes in average interest rates for the years indicated.       Changes in net interest income due to changes in volumes and rates                                                                                       2011 vs 2010         2010 vs 2009               Increase (decrease) due to change in:         Increase (decrease) due to change in:               Average         Average                   Average         Average                         Volume         Rate (1)         Total         Volume         Rate (1)         Total                                                                         (In thousands)                                                                             Increase (decrease) in interest income:                                                                             Due from banks       $ (11 )       $ 3         $ (8 )       $ 47         $ (2 )       $ 45       Federal funds sold         —           —           —           (10 )         —           (10 )     Investment securities                                                                              Taxable         311           (93 )         218           118           (594 )         (476 )      Exempt from Federal Income taxes         126           (55 )         71           (171 )         61           (110 )         Total securities         437           (148 )         289           (53 )         (533 )         (586 )     Loans         (655 )         (195 )         (850 )         232           (398 )         (166 )         Total interest income         (229 )         (340 )         (569 )         216           (933 )         (717 )                                                                                   (Decrease) increase  in interest expense:                                                                             Interest-bearing deposits         (13 )         (149 )         (162 )         118           (678 )         (560 )     Time deposits less than $100,000         (42 )         (105 )         (147 )         (12 )         (214 )         (226 )     Time certificates $100,000 or more         (224 )         (377 )         (601 )         (21 )         (570 )         (591 )         Total interest-bearing deposits         (279 )         (631 )         (910 )         85           (1,462 )         (1,377 )     FHLB advances         —           —           —           (11 )         —           (11 )     FHLB term borrowing         (41 )         (1 )         (42 )         (61 )         (5 )         (66 )     Junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures         —           (1 )         (1 )         —           (16 )         (16 )         Total interest expense         (320 )         (633 )         (953 )         13           (1,483 )         (1,470 )         Increase in net interest income       $ 91         $ 293         $ 384         $ 203         $ 550         $ 753                                                                                 (1) Factors contributing to both changes in rate and volume have been attributed to changes in rates. 2011 compared to 2010. Total interest income decreased $569,000 from $16.2 million in 2010 to $15.6 million in 2011 due primarily to a 17 basis point decline in the yield earned on average interest-earning assets and decreases in the average volume of loans. Average earning assets in 2011 were $458,000 or 0.2% less than in 2010. A decrease of $4.3 million or 15% in due from banks and a decrease of $10.8 million or 4% in average loans outstanding were offset by a $14.6 million or 33% increase in average investments. The average yield on loans was 6.00% and 6.08% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, while the average tax equivalent yield on investment securities was 3.40% and 3.78%, respectively. The decrease in average loans was due to scheduled loan repayments and to a lessor extent loan charge-offs and foreclosures. The decrease was primarily in the categories of commercial and real-estate construction loans. The decrease in weighted average yield on loans resulted primarily from competitive environment for high quality loans. The decrease in average yield on investment securities resulted from normal portfolio cash overflows being replaced with lower yielding investments. Total interest expense decreased $953,000 million or 36% from $2.6 million in 2010 to $1.6 million in 2011. Average total interest-bearing deposits decreased by $17.5 million or 8% in 2011 and average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $14.3 million or 18% in 2011. During 2011 and in line with market area trends, the Company lowered the interest rates paid on its interest-bearing deposits compared with rates paid in 2010. Interest expense on short-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) decreased $42,000 due primarily to average volume of this debt being lowered from $3.1 million in 2010 to $2.3 in 2011. FHLB term borrowing decreased by $781,000 due to scheduled repayments and maturities. There were no new FHLB term borrowings.       30     Table of Contents      As noted above, non-interest bearing deposits increased with average balances of $94.6 million and $80.3 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. These deposits represented 32% of average total deposits during 2011, compared with 27% of average total deposits during 2010. Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $14.0 million for 2011 from $13.6 million for 2010, an increase of $384,000 or 3%. The increase is primarily attributable total interest expense decreasing by $953,000 in 2011 offset by total interest income increasing by $569,000. The Company’s net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for 2011 was 4.55% compared to 4.41% in 2010. The 14 basis point increase in net interest margin resulted from the decrease in average cost of average interest-bearing liabilities, offset by the decrease in yield on average interest-bearing assets. 2010 compared to 2009. Total interest income decreased $717,000 from $16.9 million in 2009 to $16.2 million in 2010 due to primarily to a 56 basis point decline in the yield earned on average interest-earning assets partially off-set by an increase in average interest earning assets. Average earning assets in 2010 were $17.5 million or 6% greater than in 2009 due to an increase of $18.3 million or 180% in due from banks and an increase of $3.7 million or 2% in average loans outstanding. The average yield on loans was 6.08% and 6.25% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, while the average tax equivalent yield on investment securities was 3.78% and 5.22%, respectively. The increase in average loans was due to the Company’s continued marketing efforts which resulted in growth in real estate mortgage and commercial segments of the loan portfolio. The decrease in weighted average yield on loans resulted primarily from the competitive pressures for high quality lending. The increase in due from banks resulted from deposit growth that could not quickly be utilized for loan growths. Total interest expense decreased $1.5 million or 36% from $4.1 million in 2009 to $2.6 million in 2010. Average total interest-bearing deposits increased by $9.1 million or 4% in 2010 and average noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $11.8 million or 17% in 2010. During 2010 and in line with market area trends, the Company aggressively lowered the interest rates paid on its interest-bearing deposits compared with rates paid in 2009. Interest expense on short-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) decreased $11,000 due primarily to average volume of this debt being lowered from $2.0 million in 2009 to none in 2010. FHLB term borrowing decreased by $1.1 million due to scheduled repayments and maturities. There were no new FHLB term borrowings. As noted above, non-interest bearing deposits increased with average balances of $80.3 million and $68.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. These deposits represented 27% of average total deposits during 2010, compared with 25% of average total deposits during 2009. Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $13.6 million for 2010 from $12.8 million for 2009, an increase of $753,000 or 6%. The increase is primarily attributable to the lower cost of funds in 2010 of $1.5 million offset by a lower yield on earning assets of $717,000. Although average earning assets increased more than $17 million, the earnings of $216,000 attributed to this increase was offset by the decrease of $933,000 from the 56 basis points decrease in yield resulting in a net decrease in earning assets as mentioned above. Average interest bearing liabilities did increase $6 million; however the decrease in interest rates on deposits was far greater reducing the cost of funds by a net $1.5 million. The Company’s net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis for 2010 was 4.41% compared to 4.43% in 2009. The 2 basis point decrease in net interest margin resulted from the $753,000 increase in net interest income being outweighed by the $17.5 million increase in average interest-earning assets.       31     Table of Contents      Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses, which is included in operations to support the required level of the allowance for loan and lease losses, is based on credit experience and management’s ongoing evaluation of loan portfolio risk and economic conditions. The provision for loan and lease losses was $600,000 and $2.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in provision for loan losses in 2011 was primarily due to the achievement of a satisfactory level of loss reserves relative to the loan portfolio. See the sections below titled “Nonperforming Assets,” “Impaired Loans” and “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.” The Company recorded a provision for loan losses in 2009 of $7.0 million based on management’s assessment of the loan portfolio and related credit quality for that year. Non-Interest Income Non-interest income for 2011 totaled $1.6 million compared with $1.3 million in 2010 and $2.0 million in 2009. The components of non-interest income during each year were as follows:   Non-interest income               Years Ended December 31,         Change during year       (in thousands)       2011         2010         2009         2011         2010       Service charges       $ 704         $ 768         $ 766         $ (64 )       $ 2       Gain on sale of available-for-sale investment securities         290           34           416           256           (382 )     Gain on sale of other real estate         2           —           16           2           (16 )     Mortgage loan brokerage fees         55           60           43           (5 )         17       Earnings on cash surrender value of life insurance policies         292           295           288           (3 )         7       Officer life insurance proceeds         —           —           317           —           (317 )     Other         217           184           191           33           (7 )         Total non-interest income       $ 1,560         $ 1,341         $ 2,037         $ 219         $ (696 ) 2011 Compared to 2010. Non-interest income increased during 2011 primarily due to an increase in the gain on sale of available-for-sale investment securities which increased by $256,000 in 2011 as the Company executed planned investment strategies. Income from service charges on deposit accounts decreased by $64,000 in 2011 due mainly to a $12,000 decrease in account analysis charges and a decrease of $57,000 in NSF and overdraft charges based on lower transaction volumes. Earnings on bank-owned life insurance policies decreased by $3,000 due to a decline in earnings performance. Continued weakness in the residential real estate market caused a $5,000 decrease in mortgage loan brokerage fees in 2011. These decreases were offset by a $20,000 increase in other fee income, primarily from loan referrals. 2010 Compared to 2009. Non-interest income decreased by $696,000 in 2010 as a result of a $34,000 gain on sale of investment securities in 2010 compared to $416,000 in 2009 and $317,000 in life insurance proceeds in 2009 compared to none in 2010.       32     Table of Contents      Non-Interest Expense Total non-interest expense was $10.3 million in 2011, an increase of $478,000 or 5%, from the $9.8 million in non-interest expense in 2010. The following table presents the major components of non-interest expense for the years indicated.

Salaries and employee benefits increased by $431,000 or 8% in 2011 due to increased incentive compensation payments and stock-related compensation expense. Advertising and business development increased by $77,000 or 38% due to planned marketing expenditures considered necessary to support staff efforts to attract new business customers. Assessment and insurance costs decreased $180,000 or 25% due to FDIC insurance premiums being calculated using revised methodology that is more favorable to the Company. 2010 Compared to 2009. Non-interest expense in 2010 was $9.8 million, an increase of $119,000 or 1% over the 2009 total of $9.7 million. The annual increase resulted from a $382,000 or 8% increase in salaries and employee benefits due to lower deferred loan costs, and a $98,000 or 16% increase in FDIC insurance cost. In addition, data processing expenses increased $24,000 or 4% due to growth and costs associated with new Technology-oriented services. The increases were offset by a decrease of $231,000 or 15% in 2010 occupancy and fixed asset expense due to the relocation of the main branch from a leased facility to a purchased building, a $16,000 or 7% decrease in marketing and promotional expense, a $115,000 or 25% decrease in operational expenses and a $110,000 or 20% decrease in professional and legal expenses related primarily to reduced legal cost on loans. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes The Company had a provision for income taxes of $1.6 million for 2011 compared to $943,000 in 2010 and a benefit from income taxes of $1.2 million in 2009. The Company’s effective tax rate was 34.2% for 2011 compared to 30.4% and (67.1%) in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2011 from 2010 is due to a decrease in tax exempt income as a percentage of total pre-tax income in 2011 compared to 2010. Tax-exempt income includes earnings from municipal investment securities and Bank owned life insurance policies. The 2009 benefit resulted from the bad debt deduction generated by loan charge-offs recorded in that year.         33     Table of Contents        Financial Condition Investment Securities The Company purchases investment securities to maintain liquidity and manage interest rate risk within board approved parameters, as well as to generate interest revenues. The investment security portfolio consists of obligations of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies, mortgage-backed securities of U.S. government sponsored enterprises, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and other investment grade securities. The Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities typically provide both an increase in yields over U.S. Treasury and agency securities and cash flows for liquidity and reinvestment opportunities. Obligations of states and political subdivisions (municipal securities) typically provide attractive tax equivalent yields for the Company. Since the interest earnings on municipal securities are generally not taxable for Federal purposes the investment in municipal securities results in a reduction in the effective tax rate of the Company. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. In classifying its investments as available-for-sale, securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported, net of taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within shareholders’ equity.   The percentage of investment portfolio balances in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government sponsored entities and agencies, mortgage-backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions to total investment securities were 0%, 11%, 54%, and 35%, respectively, at December 31, 2011 versus 7%, 11%, 53%, and 29%, respectively, at December 31, 2010. The increase in investment securities during 2011 reflected the Company’s measured use of excess liquidity to improve profitability.

For investment securities that are considered impaired, management determines the reason for the unrealized loss by conducting additional research and analytical procedures on each security and whether the Company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms. After evaluating the investment portfolio at December 31, 2011, management determined that it was probable that the Company would collect all contractual cash flows from each impaired security. Management further determined that the Company has the intent and ability to hold each impaired security until it is no longer impaired. The following table summarizes the amounts and distribution of investment securities and their weighted average yields as of December 31, 2011.

The Company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property, business assets and deposit accounts but looks to business and personal cash flows as the primary source of repayment. Retail loan products are offered primarily for the benefit of commercial business owners and professionals who typically maintain depository and other lending relationships with the Company.

Loans outstanding at December 31, 2011 decreased by $9.8 million or 4% compared to December 31, 2010. The decrease occurred primarily in the categories of commercial and real estate-construction loans. The decrease in loans resulted mostly from scheduled loan repayments and to a lesser extent loan charge-offs and foreclosures. The Company’s new lending activity in 2011 was focused in the area of commercial real estate. In addition, certain loans were refinanced by competing banks due to management’s encouragement of the borrower to find financing elsewhere. Lack of new lending opportunities caused increased competition for higher quality loans and made it more difficult for the Company to replace normal loan run-offs.   The following table presents the maturity distribution of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2011. The table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with fixed interest rates and those with floating (variable) interest rates. Floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate. A majority of the Company’s floating rate loans have rate floors. Management considers the risk associated with fixed interest rate loans in its periodic analysis of interest rate risk.     36     Table of Contents                        Maturity of loans       (in thousands)         Within one year         After one but   within five years            After five years             Total                                                     Commercial       $ 24,403         $ 9,051         $ 5,925         $ 39,379       Real estate – mortgage (1)         29,941           51,136           84,609           165,686       Real estate – construction         9,534           7,572           2,393           19,499       Agriculture         2,388           855           488           3,731       Consumer and other         1,880           171           —           2,051          Total       $ 68,146         $ 68,785         $ 93,415         $ 230,346                                                 Loans with fixed interest rates         13,693           33,224           25,126           72,043       Loans with floating interest rates         54,453           35,561           68,289           158,303          Total       $ 68,146         $ 68,785         $ 93,415         $ 230,346       (1) Consists primarily of commercial mortgage loans.   Nonperforming Assets Nonaccrual Loans. There were $5.6 million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2010 there were $6.8 million in nonaccrual loans. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the Company had 11 loans totaling $3.8 million and 8 loans totaling $5.8 million considered to be troubled debt restructures, respectively. There were no loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Nonaccrual loans decreased during 2011 due to charge-offs, borrower repayments, and the migration of $1.1 million into other real estate owned. Other Real Estate Owned (OREO). OREO represents real property taken by the Bank either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. OREO holdings included one property totaling $1.1 million at December 31, 2011 and none at December 31, 2010. The property acquired during 2011 was comprised of commercial real estate. The following table sets forth the amount of the Company’s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated:             For the Year Ended December 31,               2011           2010             2009             2008           2007         Nonaccrual loans       $ 5,646         $ 6,823         $ 7,364         $ 4,934         $ —       Loans past due 90 days or more                                                                 and still accruing         —           —                       —           —       Total nonperforming loans         5,646           6,823           7,364           4,934           —       Other real estate owned         1,141           —           —           —           —       Total nonperforming assets       $ 6,787         $ 6,823         $ 7,364         $ 4,934         $ —       Interest income forgone on                                                                 nonaccrual loans       $ 523         $ 743         $ 435         $ 74         $ —       Interest income recorded on a                                                                 cash basis on nonaccrual loans       $ 211         $ —         $ 37         $ 52         $ —       Nonperforming loans to total                                                                 loans         2.51 %         2.91 %         3.14 %         2.18 %         0.0 %     Nonperforming assets to total                                                                 assets         1.85 %         2.00 %         2.16 %         1.61 %         0.0 %     37     Table of Contents      Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status when full collectibility of principal or interest is uncertain or when principal or interest is past due for 90 days (unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection). At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed from interest income. There was $523,000 and $743,000 in foregone interest on nonaccrual loans during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Any interest or principal payments received on a nonaccrual loan are normally applied as a principal reduction unless the nonaccrual loan balance is deemed sufficiently collectible for cash payments to be recognized as income. There was $211,000 interest income recognized on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans during 2011. Interest income recognized on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans totaled $0 and $37,000 during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when none of its principal and interest is past due and unpaid, and certain other factors are satisfied. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not necessarily result in principal and interest becoming uncollectible in whole or in part. The Company is actively pursuing collection of all the contractual amounts due for the nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2011. Those collection efforts include but are not limited to identification of additional sources of collateral or borrower cash flows, modification of loan terms, and when necessary the foreclosure and sale of loan collateral. Impaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when collection of all amounts due according to the original contractual terms is not probable. The category of impaired loans is not coextensive with the category of nonaccrual loans, although the two categories may overlap in part or in full. At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired totaled, $10.8 million, $11.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The specific allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $528,000, $1.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $11.9 million, $14.0 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The Company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies. The Company’s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews. The Company’s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as loan conditions change. The Board of Directors, through the loan committee, reviews the asset quality of new and criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full Board of Directors. In management's opinion, this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential criticized loans. The ALLL is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses. Loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the ALLL. The ALLL is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans. The adequacy of the ALLL is based upon management's continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans; including current economic conditions, maturity of the portfolio, size of the portfolio, industry concentrations, borrower credit history, collateral, the existing ALLL, independent credit reviews, current charges and recoveries to the ALLL and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management, regulatory agencies, and independent credit review consultants retained by the Company. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio. The collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree, but must relate to the borrower’s financial condition, cash flow, quality of the borrower’s management expertise, collateral and guarantees, and state of the local economy. The federal financial regulatory agencies issued an interagency policy statement in December 2006 on the ALLL along with supplemental frequently asked questions. When determining the adequacy of the ALLL, the Company follows these guidelines. The agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today’s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions. The policy statement has also been revised to conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and other supervisory guidance. The policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing, maintaining and documenting a comprehensive, systematic, and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature, scope, and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the ALLL and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the ALLL in accordance with GAAP, the institution’s stated policies and procedures, management’s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance.       38     Table of Contents      The policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an ALLL at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio (loans collectively evaluated for impairment), and that estimate of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. The policy statement states that prudent, conservative, but not excessive, loan loss allowances that represent management’s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate. In addition, the Company incorporates the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 102, which represents the SEC staff’s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the ALLL that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the Commission’s interpretations.   The Company’s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the ALLL consists of several key elements, which include but are not limited to:   §   specific allocation for problem graded loans, if any (“impaired loans”), §   general or formula allocation, §   and discretionary allocation based on loan portfolio segmentation.   Specific allocations are established based on management’s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in impaired and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question. For purposes of this analysis, loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are “special mention”, “substandard”, “doubtful”, and “loss”. Special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak, as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends, which if not corrected could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade. Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses which, if not corrected, could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt. A loan classified as “doubtful” has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable. Classified loans, as defined by the Company, include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful. Loans classified as loss are immediately charged off.   Formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics. Loss factors are based on the Company’s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. The formula allocation analysis incorporates loan losses over the over the most recent twelve quarters adjusted for changes in the business cycle. Loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the estimated loss exposure resulting from changes in market conditions and trends in the Company’s loan portfolio.   The discretionary allocation is based upon management’s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances. The conditions may include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the Company, credit quality trends, collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and other business conditions. The ALLL totaled $5.5 million or 2.38% of total loans at December 31, 2011 compared to $6.7 million or 2.78% at December 31, 2010, and $6.2 million or 2.58% at December 31, 2009. The Company’s loan loss provisions recorded during 2011, 2010, and 2009 totaled $600,000, $2.1 million, and $7.0 million, respectively. The loan loss provisions recorded during 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to specific reserves for impaired loans included approximately $528,000, $1.6 million, and $6.4 million, respectively. The remaining amount of the loan loss provisions for each year added to general reserves related to the overall trends in credit quality of the loan portfolio including an increase in the number and amount of classified and past due loans, and deterioration in the general economic environment in the Company’s primary market area. Management believes that the ALLL was adequate at December 31, 2011. However, no prediction of the ultimate level of loans charged off in future years can be made with any certainty.       39     Table of Contents      The following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the Company’s ALLL as well as charge-off and recovery activity.               For the Year Ended December 31,               2011         2010         2009           2008           2007       (dollars in thousands)               Balance at beginning of period       $ 6,699         $ 6,231         $ 3,244         $ 1,758         $ 1,746       Charge-offs:                                                                 Commercial         1,603           35           3,840           125           —       Agricultural         —           —           —           —           —       Real estate mortgage         158           1,530           173           5           —       Real estate construction         192           —           —           —           —       Consumer         —           28           —           12           —       Total charge-offs         1,953           1,593           4,013           142           —       Recoveries:                                                                 Commercial         23           11           —           27           12       Agricultural         —           —           —           —           —       Real estate mortgage         100           —           —           —           —       Real estate construction         —           —           —           —           —       Consumer         —           —           —           1           —       Total recoveries         123           11           —           28           12       Net (charge-offs) / recoveries         (1,830 )         (1,582 )         (4,013 )         (114 )         12       Provision for loan losses         600           2,050           7,000           1,600           —       Balance at end of period       $ 5,469         $ 6,699         $ 6,231         $ 3,244         $ 1,758                                                                         Net charge-offs to average loans outstanding         -0.78 %         0.65 %         1.67 %         .05 %         (.01 )%     Average loans outstanding       $ 233,474         $ 243,519         $ 239,428         $ 219,4311         $ 194,734       Ending allowance to total loans outstanding         2.38 %         2.78 %         2.58 %         1.41 %         0.87 %   Deposits Deposits are obtained primarily from local businesses and residents. The average deposits and the average rates paid for 2011, 2010, and 2009 are presented in the “Results of Operations” section under the heading “Net Interest Income.” Average total deposits for 2011 were $294.9 million compared to $298.1 million for 2010, a decrease of $3.2 million or 1%. Average brokered deposits included in these totals were $6.6 million in 2011 and $16.0 million in 2010. The Company has utilized brokered deposits primarily as a way of diversifying its funding sources. Total brokered deposits at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $9.2 million and $17.8 million, respectively. There were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2011. The Company’s deposits increased from $294.3 million at December 31, 2010 to $315.9 at December 31, 2011, an increase of $21.6 million or 7%. If brokered deposits are excluded, total deposits at December 31, 2011 increased by $30.8 million or 11% from December 31, 2010, The increase in deposits was due to a year-end spike in demand deposits offset by the unplanned call of $9.0 million of brokered deposits.         40     Table of Contents      The following chart sets forth the distribution of the Company’s average daily deposits for the periods indicated.               For the Year ended December 31,               2011         2010         2009                         Average                   Average                   Average               Average         Yield/         Average         Yield/         Average         Yield/       (dollars in thousands)       Balance         Rate         Balance         Rate         Balance         Rate       Deposits:                                                                             Non-interest bearing deposits       $ 94,582                     $ 80,273                     $ 68,509                   Interest-bearing deposits:                                                                                 Interest bearing demand deposits         36,138           0.42%           39,534           0.53%           36,689           1.37%           Money market accounts         72,103           0.51%           72,887           0.65%           65,265           1.13%           Savings         12,017           0.23%           10,088           0.25%           10,103           0.25%           Time deposits         80,053           1.11%           95,302           1.72%           96,621           2.54%              Total interest-bearing deposits         200,311           0.72%           217,811           1.08%           208,678           1.78%                  Total deposits       $ 294,893                     $ 298,084                     $ 277,187                                                                                             The following table summarizes by time remaining to maturity, the amount of certificates of deposit issued in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2011.                               Maturities of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more               (dollars in thousands)       Balance         Percent of   total       Three months or less       $ 17,111           34%       Over three months through nine months         24,094           48%       Over nine months through twelve months         8,180           16%       Over twelve months         791           2%       Total certificates of deposit of $100,000 and more       $ 50,176           100%   Borrowings Federal Home Loan Bank. The Company maintains a borrowing relationship with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (FHLB) which offers both long-term and short-term borrowing facilities. The Company has qualifying loans as collateral for its borrowing lines as required by FHLB. At December 31, 2011, term borrowing outstanding from the FHLB totaled $1.0 million compared to $2.6 million at December 31, 2010. There was no new term borrowings during 2011 and the reduction from the prior year was attributable to scheduled principal repayments and maturities. Average total term borrowings from FHLB totaled $2.3 million for 2011 at an average cost of 5.18% compared to average term borrowings of $3.1 million at an average cost of 5.23% for 2010. There were no short-term borrowings from FHLB at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Federal Reserve Discount Window. At December 31, 2011, the Bank could borrow approximately 60% of pledged loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The Bank’s discount window borrowing line was approximately $46.1 million at December 31, 2011 and there were no outstanding borrowings. Other Borrowing Arrangements. In addition to FHLB and FRB borrowing lines, the Company maintains a short-term unsecured borrowing arrangement with a correspondent bank to meet unforeseen cash needs. This borrowing line totaled $10.0 million at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. The borrowing line is utilized infrequently and there was no balance outstanding at either December 31, 2011 or 2010.       41     Table of Contents      Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures. During 2003, the Company formed Valley Commerce Trust I with a capital investment of $93,000 for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. During the second quarter of 2003, Valley Commerce Trust I issued trust preferred securities for gross proceeds of $3.0 million and invested this amount plus the $93,000 of capital proceeds in floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Company. The Subordinated Debentures mature on April 7, 2033 and are repriced quarterly to an interest rate that is the sum of 3-month Libor plus 3.30%. The interest rate at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 was 3.65% and 3.69%, respectively. Trust preferred securities are includable in the Company’s Tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes subject to certain limitations. The action taken to form Valley Commerce Trust I and issue trust preferred securities was made for the purpose of enhancing the Company’s capital position and to provide for the continued growth of the Bank. Off-Balance Sheet Items As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit were the only financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, commitments to extend credit totaled $31.8 million and $29.8 million, respectively, and letters of credit totaled $475,000 and $275,000, respectively. The Company has not entered into any contracts for financial derivative instruments such as futures, swaps, options or similar instruments. Contractual Obligations The Company’s contractual obligations are comprised of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, an operating lease for office space in Fresno through 2017, and post-retirement benefit plans. Capital Resources Federal regulations establish guidelines for calculating leverage and risk-based capital ratios. The guidelines for risk-based capital ratios, which apply to banks and bank holding companies, establish a systematic approach of assigning risk weights to assets and commitments making capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles. For these purposes, “Tier 1” capital consists of common equity, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, trust preferred securities subject to regulatory limitation, and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and excludes goodwill and certain deferred tax assets. “Tier 2” capital consists of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and (subject to a limit of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets) general loan loss reserves. In calculating the relevant ratio, a company’s assets and off-balance sheet commitments are risk-weighted; thus, for example, loans are included at 100% of their book value while assets considered less risky are included at a percentage of their book value (20%, for example, for U. S. Government Agency securities, and 0% for vault cash and U. S. Government Treasury securities).         42     Table of Contents        The Board of Directors regularly reviews the Company’s capital ratios to ensure that capital exceeds the prescribed regulatory minimums and is otherwise adequate to meet future needs. The following table summarizes the Company’s risk-based capital ratios as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010:       Capital and capital adequacy ratios             Year ended December 31,               2011         2010       (dollars in thousands)       Amount         Ratio         Amount         Ratio       Leverage Ratio                                                     Valley Commerce Bancorp    and Subsidiary       $ 44,691           13.1%         $ 41,791           12.1%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 13,626           4.0%         $ 13,859           4.0%                                                             Valley Business Bank       $ 44,648           13.1%         $ 41,663           12.0%       Minimum requirement for “Well-    Capitalized” institution       $ 17,032           5.0%         $ 17,324           5.0%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 13,621           4.0%         $ 13,854           4.0%                                                             Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio                                                     Valley Commerce Bancorp    and Subsidiary       $ 44,691           17.6%         $ 41,791           16.2%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 10,145           4.0%         $ 10,323           4.0%                                                             Valley Business Bank       $ 44,648           17.6%         $ 41,663           16.2%       Minimum requirement for “Well-    Capitalized” institution       $ 15,214           6.0%         $ 15,479           6.0%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 10,142           4.0%         $ 10,319           4.0%                                                             Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio                                                     Valley Commerce Bancorp    and Subsidiary       $ 45,060           18.9%         $ 45,060           17.5%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 20,290           8.0%         $ 20,645           8.0%                                                             Valley Business Bank       $ 44,931           18.9%         $ 44,931           17.4%       Minimum requirement for “Well-    Capitalized” institution       $ 25,356           10.0%         $ 25,798           10.0%       Minimum regulatory requirement       $ 20,285           8.0%         $ 20,639           8.0%   At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, all of the Company’s capital ratios were in excess of minimum regulatory requirements, and Valley Business Bank exceeded the minimum requirements of a “well capitalized” institution. In the second quarter of 2003, Valley Commerce Trust I issued $3.0 million of trust preferred securities. Trust preferred securities are includable in Tier 1 capital, subject to regulatory limitation. At December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2010, the entire $3.0 million was included in Tier 1 capital. The Company’s average equity as a percentage of average assets was 11.8% for 2011 and 11.0% for 2010. Year-end shareholders’ equity as a percentage of year-end assets was 11.60% and 11.35% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Changes in these ratios reflects 2011 income, offset by cash dividends paid on preferred stock. The Company issued a 5% stock dividend in 2011 and 2009. There was no dividend issued during 2010. The Company has not declared or paid cash dividends since inception. Stock splits and dividends are not dilutive to capital ratios.       43     Table of Contents      The Company commenced a stock repurchase program as of November 2007. The program is subject to restrictions contained in the Securities Purchase Agreement between the Company and the Treasury under which the Company issued $7.7 million of preferred stock to the Treasury on January 30, 2009. The Purchase Agreement contains provisions that restrict the Company’s ability to repurchase Valley Commerce Bancorp common stock. Under the Purchase Agreement, prior to January 30, 2012, unless the Company has redeemed the Preferred Shares, or the Treasury has transferred the Preferred Shares to a third party, the consent of the Treasury will be required for the Company to redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Common Stock or other equity or capital securities, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice and certain other circumstances specified in the Purchase Agreement. The stock repurchase program expired on November 30, 2010. The amount of preferred stock issued to the Treasury represents approximately 3% of the Company’s risk adjusted assets. Accordingly, the impact to the Company’s risk-based capital ratios is an increase of approximately 300 basis points. On March 21, 2012, pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and following receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, the Company repurchased the Series B and Series C Preferred Stock which was sold to the United States Department of Treasury in January 2009.  The purchase price was $8,085,000 comprised of 7,700 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share and 385 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share.  The Company had no preferred stock remaining after the transaction and made a pro-rated final dividend payment on the transaction date.  Because the preferred stock qualified as Tier 1 capital, the Company’s Tier 1 capital was reduced by an amount that approximated the purchase price.    Liquidity Management   Liquidity is the ability to provide funds to meet customers’ loan and deposit needs and to fund operations in a timely and cost effective manner. The Company’s primary source of funds is deposits. On an ongoing basis, management anticipates funding needs for loans, asset purchases, maturing deposits, and other needs and initiates deposit promotions as needed. Management measures the Company’s liquidity position monthly through the use of short-term and medium-term internal liquidity calculations. These are monitored on an ongoing basis by the Board of Directors and the Company’s Asset Liability Management Committee.   The Company has a successful history of establishing and retaining deposit relationships with local business customers. It periodically utilizes collateralized borrowing lines and wholesale funding resources to supplement local deposit growth. These include borrowing lines with FHLB, FRB, and correspondent banks, and utilization of brokered time deposits. At December 31, 2011, the Company had available credit of $49.0 million from the FHLB, $46.1 million from the Federal Reserve Bank, and $10.0 million from correspondent banks.   The Company’s off-balance sheet financing arrangements are primarily limited to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which totaled $31.8 million and $475,000, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Management monitors these arrangements monthly in the overall assessment of the Company’s liquidity needs. The Company has no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The Company does not retain a repurchase option or contingent interest in any of its loan participations.   As discussed above, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Valley Commerce Trust I, issued trust preferred securities for gross proceeds of $3.0 million on April 7, 2003. Quarterly interest payments on these securities are considered in management’s normal evaluation of liquidity needs. Although the trust preferred securities do not mature until April 7, 2033, Valley Commerce Trust I has the option to redeem the trust preferred securities at any time after April 7, 2008. The Company will carefully evaluate the impact on capital and liquidity if and when consideration is given to redemption of trust preferred securities.   In addition, as discussed above, the Company issued $7.7 million of preferred stock to the Treasury on January 30, 2009 and pays quarterly cash dividends on this stock. The Company will carefully evaluate the impact on capital and liquidity if and when consideration is given to redemption of the preferred stock.     44     Table of Contents      The Company’s strategic objectives include expanding through opening of loan production offices and acquiring productive assets from other institutions. The Company’s planning efforts consider the impact of known and anticipated cash outlays so that sufficient liquidity is maintained for both capital and operational needs.   ITEM 7A – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Not applicable. 		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     54     ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Overview   Income.  Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are prepayment penalties on multi-family, mixed-use and non-residential real estate loans and service charges – mostly from service charges on deposit accounts – and fees for various services.   Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.   Expenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salary and employee benefits expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, advertising expenses, federal insurance premiums and other miscellaneous expenses.   Salary and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits.   Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of depreciation charges, ATM and data processing expenses, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance, real estate taxes and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the related assets, which range from three to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the lease.   Advertising expenses include expenses for print, promotions, third-party marketing services and premium items.   Federal insurance premiums are payments we make to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts.   Other expenses include expenses for professional services, office supplies, postage, telephone, insurance, charitable contributions, regulatory assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses.   Critical Accounting Policies   We consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies: allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes.   Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the statement of financial condition date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change. Management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio.       29     Table of Contents        Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. For additional discussion, see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing.   Deferred Income Taxes . We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period, which would negatively affect earnings.   Sale of New York City Branch Office   On June 29, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its branch office building located at 1353-55 First Avenue, New York, New York (the “Property”). The sale price for the Property was $28.0 million. At closing, the Company received $10.0 million in cash and an $18.0 million zero coupon promissory note recorded at its then present value of $16.3 million. The Note, as restructured, including expenses and interest, was paid off on November 4, 2011.   In connection with the sale of the branch office building, the Bank entered into a 99-year lease agreement to enable the Bank to retain a branch office at 1353-55 First Avenue. This lease will be effective upon the completion of the renovation of the property. We have temporarily relocated our First Avenue branch office to 1470 First Avenue while 1353-55 First Avenue is being renovated.   Sale of Brooklyn Branch   On December 6, 2010 the Bank completed the sale of its branch office located at 2047 86th Street, Brooklyn, New York to Poncé De Leon Federal Bank. The Bank transferred approximately $27.7 million in deposits to Ponce De Leon Federal Bank in connection with the closing of the transaction. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank did not acquire any loans as part of the transaction. A $1.9 million gain was recognized from the sale of the Brooklyn branch office.   Acquisition of the Business Assets of Hayden Financial Group LLC   On November 16, 2007, the Bank acquired the operating assets of Hayden Financial Group LLC (“Hayden”), an investment advisory firm located in Connecticut, at a cost of $2.0 million. The Bank paid $1.3 million at closing, and $700,000 will be paid in four annual installments of $175,000. The acquisition of these business assets has enabled the Bank to expand the services it provides to include investment advisory and financial planning services to the then-existing Hayden customer base as well as future customers through a networking arrangement with a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser. In connection with this transaction, we acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships of $710,000 and goodwill of $1,310,000 and booked a note payable with a present value of $625,000. The intangible asset has been determined to have an 11.7-year life and, absent impairment issues, is being amortized to operations over that period using the straight-line method. Both the intangible assets and goodwill will be subject to impairment review on no less than an annual basis. The note is payable in four annual installments, one on each succeeding note anniversary date, of $175,000. The note was initially recorded at $625,000, assuming a 4.60% discount rate.       30     Table of Contents        In November 2011, on the note’s final installment due date, the holder of the note elected to defer the final installment payment until 2012. As such, the note payable was reclassified as an account payable of $175,000 at December 31, 2011. The note discount accreted during 2011 totaled $7,000. The acquired business is being operated as a division of the Bank and, during 2011, generated total revenues of approximately $894,000.   Balance Sheet Analysis   Overview.  Total assets at December 31, 2011 increased by $23.3 million, or 5.0%, to $489.3 million from total assets of $466.0 million at December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily due to increases of $38.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $2.1 million in premises and equipment, net, $1.3 million in other assets, and $591,000 in bank owned life insurance, offset by decreases of $13.9 million in loans receivable, net, $3.8 million in investment securities held-to-maturity, $348,000 in certificates of deposits at other financial institutions, $313,000 in real estate owned, $251,000 in Federal Home Loan Bank stock, and $205,000 in accrued interest receivable.   These increases primarily resulted from increases of $26.8 million in deposits and $2.7 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $5.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. As of December 31, 2011, the Company, on a consolidated basis, had stockholders equity of $107.1 million, or 21.9% of assets.   During the second half of 2011, we began increasing our origination of loans secured by real-estate. We have not re-entered the construction loan market. In 2010, we proactively reduced mortgage origination levels for mixed-use and non-residential real estate loans, based on our unwillingness to offer rates and terms on loan products that, in our opinion, do not accurately reflect the risk associated with particular loan types in the current economic and real estate environment.  In 2009, we ceased originating all construction loans due to prevailing conditions in the real estate market.   Loans. Our primary lending activity is the origination of loans secured by real estate. We originate real estate loans secured by multi-family residential real estate, mixed-use real estate and non-residential real estate. To a much lesser extent, we originate commercial and industrial and consumer loans. At December 31, 2011, loans receivable, net, totaled $350.9 million, a decrease of $13.9 million, or 3.8%, from total loans receivable, net, of $364.8 million at December 31, 2010. The promissory notes that the Bank received in connection with the sale of the Bank’s branch office building located at 1353-55 First Avenue, which was paid off on November 4, 2011 and had a $10.9 million balance at December 31, 2010, were included in the non-residential segment of our real estate loan portfolio for 2010.   The largest segment of our real estate loans is multi-family residential loans. As of December 31, 2011, these loans totaled $189.3 million, or 52.9% of our total loan portfolio, compared to $190.0 million, or 51.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, mixed-use loans totaled $51.2 million, or 14.3% of our total loan portfolio, compared to $55.2 million, or 14.9% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Non-residential real estate loans totaled $83.6 million, or 23.4% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, compared to $100.9 million, or 27.2% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, one- to four-family residential real estate loans totaled $627,000 and $211,000, or 0.2% and 0.1% of our total loan portfolio, respectively.   At December 31, 2011, our commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled $43.3 million in committed loans, with $23.7 million drawn against such commitments, compared to $28.9 million in committed loans, with $12.1 million drawn against such commitments at December 31, 2010. Although we discontinued in 2010 the purchase of participation interests in construction loans secured by multi-family, mixed-use and non-residential properties, we purchased participation interests in these types of properties in 2009. We perform our own underwriting analysis on each of our participation interests before purchasing such loans. The outstanding balance of construction loan participation interests purchased totaled $9.1 million, or 2.5% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2011 compared to $12.9 million or 3.5% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.       31     Table of Contents        In addition, we also originate several types of consumer loans secured by savings accounts or certificates of deposit (share loans) and overdraft protection for checking accounts which is linked to statement savings accounts and has the ability to transfer funds from the statement savings account to the checking account when needed to cover overdrafts.

Our primary source of funds is retail deposit accounts which are comprised of savings accounts, demand deposits and certificates of deposit held primarily by individuals and businesses within our primary market area and, prior to 2010 but resumed in 2011 to a small extent, non-broker certificates of deposit gathered through two nationwide certificate of deposit listing services. The non-broker certificates of deposits were accepted from banks, credit unions, non-profit organizations and certain corporations in amounts greater then $75,000 and less then $250,000. Although we curtailed the use of the certificate of deposit listing services in 2010, we resumed the use of these services in 2011 by obtaining $10.0 million in non-broker certificates of deposits.   Deposits increased by $26.8 million, or 8.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in deposits was primarily attributable to efforts by the Company to increase deposits in the two Massachusetts branch offices through an increase in our marketing campaign and the offering of competitive interest rates in our savings, NOW and money market deposit accounts. This resulted in increases of $31.6 million in NOW and money market deposit accounts, $24.6 million in savings accounts, and $5.2 million in noninterest bearing demand deposits, offset by a decrease of $34.6 million in certificates of deposits.   The following table sets forth the balances of our deposit products at the dates indicated.               At December 31,               2011         2010         2009               Amount         Percent         Amount         Percent         Amount         Percent               (Dollars in thousands)                                                                                     NOW and money market deposit accounts       $ 115,411           32.6 %       $ 83,839           25.7 %       $ 72,755           19.2 %     Savings accounts         80,548           22.8           55,898           17.1           60,033           15.8       Noninterest bearing demand deposits         15,046           4.3           9,839           3.0           11,594           3.0       Certificates of deposit         142,631           40.3           177,254           54.2           235,136           62.0                                                                                     Total       $ 353,636           100.0 %       $ 326,830           100.0 %       $ 379,518           100.0 %   At December 31, 2011, there were $19.5 million in money market deposits that are fully-insured brokered deposits as defined in the FDIC call report instructions. These money market deposits were obtained from one of our retail depositors and then transferred into the Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) Network in order to obtain full FDIC insurance coverage for our customer. These types of deposits are known in the ICS Network as reciprocal deposits, which the Company considers as core deposits and not brokered deposits. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the Company had no ICS reciprocal deposits.   The following table indicates the amount of certificates of deposit with balances over $100,000 by time remaining until maturity as of December 31, 2011. We do not solicit jumbo certificates of deposit nor do we offer special rates for jumbo certificates. The minimum deposit to open a certificate of deposit ranges from $500 to $2,500.       Maturity Period       Certificates of Deposit               (In thousands)       Three months or less       $ 5,636       Over three through six months         11,675       Over six through twelve months         32,256       Over twelve months         24,765       Total       $ 74,332     Borrowings . We may utilize borrowings from a variety of sources to supplement our supply of funds for loans and investments and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”) decreased to $20.0 million as of December 31, 2011 from $25.0 million FHLB advances outstanding as of December 31, 2010.       37     Table of Contents        The contractual maturities of FHLB advances at December 31, 2011 are as follows:               Amount         Weighted Average Interest Rate       Advances maturing in:                             One year or less       $ 5,000           0.59 %     After one to two years         10,000           3.70 %     After two to three years         5,000           3.64 %             $ 20,000           2.91 %   In conjunction with the Hayden acquisition on November 16, 2007, the Company incurred a four-year zero-coupon note payable of $700,000. The note is payable in four annual installments, one on each succeeding note anniversary date, of $175,000. The note was initially recorded at $625,000, assuming a 4.60% discount rate. The note payable balance at December 31, 2011 was zero because, in November 2011, on the note’s final installment due date, the holder of the note elected to defer the final installment payment until 2012. As such, the note payable was reclassified as an account payable of $175,000 at December 31, 2011. The note discount accreted during 2011 totaled $7,000.   Stockholders’ Equity . Stockholders’ equity decreased by $1.1 million, or 1.0%, to $107.0 million at December 31, 2011, from $108.1 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease was primarily due to treasury stock purchases of $3.0 million pursuant to the Company’s stock repurchase plan and cash dividends of $614,000, offset by comprehensive income of $2.4 million and $160,000 for ESOP shares earned for the period.   Northeast Community Bancorp, MHC, the Company’s majority stockholder, received approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Reserve Board to waive its right to receive its share of cash dividends declared by the Company in 2011, which totaled approximately $873,000, and for similar quarterly cash dividends, if any, to be paid for the first quarter of 2012. On a cumulative basis, $3.9 million of such dividends have been waived through December 31, 2011. See “Risk Factors—The amount of dividends we pay on our common stock, if any, may be limited by the ability of NorthEast Community Bancorp, MHC to waive receipt of dividends.”   Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011 and 2010   Overview.               2011         2010         % Change 2011/2010             (Dollars in thousands)                                                 Net income       $ 2,355         $ 1,868           26.1 %     Return on average assets         0.51 %         0.37 %         37.8 %     Return on average equity         2.18 %         1.72 %         26.7 %     Average equity to average assets         23.37 %         21.30 %         9.7 %   Net income for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $487,000, or 26.1%, to $2.4 million from $1.9 million in 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income and a decrease in the provision for loan losses, offset by increases in non-interest expense and provision for income taxes and a decrease in non-interest income.   Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $767,000, or 4.7%, to $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, from $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities that exceeded the decrease in the yield on our interest-earning assets. The net interest spread increased by 57 basis points to 3.53% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 2.96% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net interest margin increased by 50 basis points to 3.89% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 3.39% for the year ended December 31, 2010.       38     Table of Contents        The increase in the interest rate spread and the net interest margin in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities decreasing more than the corresponding decrease in the yield on our interest-earning assets. The cost of our interest-bearing liabilities decreased by 65 basis points to 1.54% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 2.19% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The yield on our interest-earning assets decreased by 8 basis points to 5.07% for the year ended December 31, 2011, from 5.15% for the year ended December 31, 2011. The decrease in both the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities was due to the low interest rate environment in 2010 that continued throughout 2011.   Average Balances and Yields . The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting annualized average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. For purposes of this table, average balances have been calculated using average daily balances. Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans. Interest income on loans and investment securities has not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis because the impact would be insignificant.               Year Ended December 31,               2011

The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.               2011 Compared to 2010         2010 Compared to 2009               Increase (Decrease) Due to                   Increase (Decrease) Due to                         Volume         Rate         Net         Volume         Rate         Net               (In thousands)       Interest and dividend income:                                                                             Loans receivable       $ (996 )       $ (1,158 )       $ (2,154 )       $ (224 )       $ (124 )       $ (348 )     Investment securities         (208 )         (61 )         (269 )         784           (46 )         738       Other interest-earning assets         (26 )         (42 )         (68 )         (9 )         (112 )         (121 )     Total interest-earning assets         (1,230 )         (1,261 )         (2,491 )         551           (282 )         269                                                                                     Interest expense:                                                                             Interest-bearing demand deposits         (14 )         (462 )         (476 )         631           120           751       Savings accounts         14           3           17           (26 )         (28 )         (54 )     Certificates of deposit         (1,037 )         (1,348 )         (2,385 )         (317 )         (1,669 )         (1,986 )     Borrowings         (235 )         (179 )         (414 )         (430 )         62           (368 )     Total interest-bearing liabilities         (1,273 )         (1,985 )         (3,258 )         (142 )         (1,515 )         (1,657 )     Net change in interest income       $ 43         $ 724         $ 767         $ 693         $ 1,233         $ 1,926     Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded provisions for loan losses of $1.1 million and $3.5 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2011, we charged-off $1.4 million against eleven non-performing multi-family mortgage loans and one non-performing non-residential mortgage loan to reduce the aggregate carrying value to $3.5 million as of December 31, 2011. During 2010, we charged-off $2.6 million against fifteen non-performing multi-family mortgage loans and six non-performing non-residential mortgage loans to reduce the aggregate carrying value to $10.3 million as of December 31, 2010. The primary reason for the decreased provision during 2011 was a reduced level of charge offs and troubled debt restructurings. The Company’s Special Assets Group continues to monitor our loan portfolio and reviews at least quarterly and, more frequently, if necessary all non-performing loans, potential non-performing loans, and restructured loans. An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses is presented under “Risk Management – Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.”   We recorded recoveries of $12,000 and $45,000 during the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.   Noninterest Income. The following table shows the components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.               2011         2010         % Change 2011/2010             (Dollars in thousands)       Other loan fees and service charges       $ 390         $ 313           24.6 %     Net gain from premises and equipment         10           1,924           (99.5 )     Earnings on bank owned life insurance         591           623           (5.1 )     Investment advisory fees         894           769           16.3       Other         7           13           (46.2 )        Total       $ 1,892         $ 3,642           (48.1 )       40     Table of Contents        The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a $1.9 million gain from the sale of the Brooklyn branch office that occurred in December 2010, a $32,000 decrease in earnings on bank owned life insurance, and a $6,000 decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $125,000 increase in fee income generated by Hayden Wealth Management Group, the Company’s investment advisory and financial planning services division, and a $77,000 increase in other loan fees and service charges, which was positively impacted by our new mortgage brokering operations.   Noninterest Expense.  The following table shows the components of noninterest expense and the percentage changes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.               Year Ended December 31,                         2011         2010         % Change 2011/2010             (Dollars in thousands)                 Salaries and employee benefits       $ 7,204         $ 7,028           2.5 %     Net occupancy expense of premises         1,156           1,226           (5.7 )     Equipment         625           541           15.5       Outside data processing         799           850           (6.0 )     Advertising         178           64           179.1       REO expenses         182           307           (40.6 )     FDIC insurance premiums         404           514           (21.4 )     Service contracts         301           283           6.4       Insurance         199           212           (6.5 )     Audit and accounting         327           333           (1.7 )     Directors compensation         320           305           4.7       Telephone         209           212           (1.4 )     Office supplies and stationary         97           128           (23.7 )     Director, officer, and employee expenses         505           247           104.6       Legal fees         559           603           (7.2 )     Other         1,136           737           54.2       Total noninterest expenses       $ 14,201         $ 13,590           4.5     Non-interest expense increased by $611,000, or 4.5%, to $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from increases of $399,000 in other noninterest expense, $176,00 in salaries and employee benefits, $114,000 in advertising expense, and $84,000 in equipment expense, offset by decreases of $125,000 in real estate owned expense, $110,000 in FDIC insurance expense, $70,000 in net occupancy expense, and $51,000 in outside data processing expense.   Other noninterest expense increased by $399,000, or 54.2%, to $1.1 million in 2011 from $737,000 in 2010 due to our expansion efforts in Massachusetts, in particular costs associated with our new mortgage brokering operations.   Salaries and employee benefits, which represented 50.7% of the Company’s non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $176,000, or 2.5%, to $7.2 million in 2011 from $7.0 million in 2010 due to the hiring of additional loan production staff in the Company’s Massachusetts locations, offset by a reduction in staff in various departments and the sale of the Brooklyn branch office in December 2010.   Advertising expense increased by $114,000, or 178.1%, to $178,000 in 2011 from $64,000 in 2010 due to an increase in marketing efforts to expand our Massachusetts operations. Equipment expense increased by $84,000, or 15.5%, to $625,000 in 2011 from $541,000 in 2010 due to purchases of additional equipment to support our Massachusetts expansion efforts.       41     Table of Contents        Real estate owned expenses decreased to $182,000 in 2011 due primarily to a loss of $140,000 on the disposition of a multi-family property and net operating expenses of $42,000 in connection with the maintenance and operation of foreclosed properties. This compared to real estate owned expense of $307,000 in 2010 due to the Bank’s recognition of loss of $103,000 on the disposition of a multi-family property and two gasoline stations and net operating expenses of $204,000 in connection with the maintenance and operation of foreclosed properties (consisting of a multi-family property and two gasoline stations which were foreclosed and sold and two multi-family properties).   FDIC insurance expense decreased by $110,000, or 21.4%, to $404,000 in 2011 from $514,000 in 2010 due to a change in the FDIC assessment base and assessment formula. Occupancy expense decreased by $70,000, or 5.7%, to $1.16 million in 2011 from $1.23 million in 2010 due to the sale of the Brooklyn branch office, offset by the addition of a facility to house the Massachusetts loan operations.   Outside data processing expense decreased by $51,000, or 6.0%, to $799,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $850,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to the sale of the Brooklyn branch office and several one-time additional services provided in 2010 by the Company’s core data processing vendor.   Provision for Income Taxes.  Income taxes increased by $293,000, or 32.4%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $904,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase resulted primarily from a $780,000 increase in pre-tax income in 2011 compared to 2010. The effective tax rate was 33.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010.   Risk Management   Overview. Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and operational risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Other risks that we face are market risk, liquidity risk and reputation risk. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities, that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue.   Credit Risk Management. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans. We underwrite each mortgage loan application on its merits, applying risk factors to insure that each transaction is considered on an equitable basis.   When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to attempt to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. When the ten day grace period expires and the payment has not been received, a late payment notice is mailed and telephone contact is initiated. Throughout the rest of the month that payment is due, the borrower is called several times. If the payment has not been received by the end of the month, the borrower is informed that the loan will be placed in foreclosure within two weeks. On the 45 th day after payment is due, the loan is forwarded to the problem loan officer who will review the file and may authorize an acceleration letter. Once a foreclosure action has been instituted, a written agreement between the Bank and the debtor will be required to discontinue the foreclosure action. We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances. If no satisfactory resolution to the delinquency is forthcoming, the note and mortgage may be sold prior to a foreclosure sale or the real property securing the loan would be sold at foreclosure.   In addition, nonperforming loans and potential nonperforming loans are reviewed on a regular basis by management’s Special Assets Group (“SAG”). The Board authorized the SAG to address the increase in non-performing loans as a result of the economic and real estate collapse that began in 2008. The Board and Senior Management believe that individual attention for each troubled loan gives that loan the best opportunity of recovery or disposal at the least cost to the Bank.       42     Table of Contents        The SAG is comprised of the chief executive officer, a director of special assets who is a loan workout specialist, one special asset coordinator and one facilities officer specializing in building management. The SAG’s mandate is to identify problem and potential problem loans in conjunction with the internal loan review process, to evaluate the loan and determine the cause of the problem and whether there is a realistic probability that the loan can be returned to a performing status over a reasonable time frame, and to ascertain whether the borrower is willing and able to work with the Bank in an effort to save the loan and their investment.   Once it is determined that the borrower is willing and able to cooperate in the effort, SAG assumes responsibility for the loan and devises a plan to correct the deficiencies. The plan may take the form of a short term forbearance agreement, a moderate or longer term restructure agreement or an A/B note and mortgage split. With the cooperation of the borrower, SAG will implement the plan and monitor its progress to assure as timely a resolution as possible.   It is our belief that it is in the Bank’s and the borrower’s best interest to work to keep a property viable and performing during these difficult economic times, thereby helping to limit loan losses when there is a reasonable expectation that the property will be able to support the original debt once the current crisis has passed. A successful plan will ultimately return the loan to a performing status and the Plan will terminate when the loan is reclassified as performing.   Should a workable plan not be possible, the SAG is charged with disposing of the loan as quickly and cost effectively as possible. This may be accomplished through foreclosure, a sale of the note and mortgage or a short sale.   In connection with the above, in 2009 and 2010 the Bank entered into short-term restructuring agreements with 26 borrowers whose loans in the aggregate totaled $30.9 million. Each of these loans was performing prior to the restructuring and have continued to perform under the terms of the restructuring agreements. Restructuring terms were generally consistent with market terms. We do not consider these loans to be impaired.   Management reports to the board of directors monthly regarding the amount of loans past-due more than 30 days.   Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets. We generally consider repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be nonperforming assets. It is generally our policy to continue to accrue interest on past-due loans and loans in foreclosure as long as management determines that these loans are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations. Typically, payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to interest only if collection of principal is reasonably assured.   Real estate that we acquire as a result of a foreclosure action or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is initially recorded at fair market value at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis. Holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income.       43     Table of Contents        The following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.               At December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               (Dollars in thousands)       Nonaccrual loans:                                                                 Residential real estate:                                                                 One- to four-family       $ —         $ —         $ —         $ —         $ —       Multi-family         4,229           2,219           5,806           261           666       Mixed-use         722           —           —           —           —       Non-residential real estate         6,634           5,457           14,344           1,614           1,200       Construction         7,661           11,575           —           —           —       Commercial and industrial         —           —           —           —           —       Consumer and other loans         —           —           —           —           1       Total         19,246           19,251           20,150           1,875           1,867                                                                         Accruing loans past due 90 days or more:                                                                 Residential real estate:                                                                 One- to four-family         —           —           —           —           —       Multi-family         1,192           2,555           —           —           407       Mixed-use         —           —           —           —           —       Non-residential real estate         —           —           —           —           —       Construction         —           —           —           —           —       Commercial and industrial         —           —           —           —           —       Consumer and other loans         —           —           —           —           —       Total         1,192           2,555           —           —           407       Total of nonaccrual and 90 days or more past due loans         20,438           21,806           20,150           1,875           2,274                                                                         Foreclosed real estate         620           933           636           832           —       Other nonperforming loans         —           —           —           1,345           —       Total nonperforming assets         21,058           22,739           20,786           4,052           2,274                                                                         Accruing troubled debt restructurings         14,039           30,893           13,175           —           —       Nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings         1,435           —           —           —           —       Total troubled debt restructurings         15,474           30,893           13,175           —           —       Less nonaccrual troubled debt restructuring in total nonaccrual loans         1,435           —           —                                                                                                 Troubled debt restructurings and total nonperforming assets       $ 35,097         $ 53,632         $ 33,961         $ 4,052         $ 2,274                                                                         Total nonperforming loans to total loans         5.72 %         5.87 %         5.14 %         0.88 %         0.80 %     Total nonperforming assets to total assets         4.30 %         4.88 %         3.94 %         0.96 %         0.66 %     Total nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings to total assets         7.17 %         11.51 %         6.44 %         0.96 %         0.66 %     Other than disclosed in the above table and in the classified assets table below, management believes that there are no other loans at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 that we have serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms.   Troubled debt restructurings occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower’s financial difficulties. These concessions may include, but are not limited to, modifications of the terms of the debt, the transfer of assets or the issuance of any equity interest by the borrower to satisfy all or part of the debt, or the substitution or addition of borrower(s). Generally, we will not upgrade the internal classification of a troubled debt restructuring until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make principal and interest payments under the restructure terms for at least six consecutive months.       44     Table of Contents        The non-accrual multi-family mortgage loans, net of charge-offs of $326,000, totalled $4.2 million at December 31, 2011, consisting primarily of the following mortgage loans:   (1) A delinquent loan with an outstanding balance of $1.6 million secured by a three apartment building complex. The Company filed a foreclosure action and the court granted the Company’s request for the appointment of a receiver for the property. The receiver’s managing agent is collecting the rents and paying operating expenses and taxes. The court appointed receiver is moving forward with filing a contempt motion against the borrower for its failure to turn over security deposits and books and records. The Supreme Court has also agreed to let the Company move forward with a summary judgment motion returnable on February 3, 2012. A specific reserve of $127,000 has been established to mark the loan to fair value. On February 27, 2012, the loan was satisfied with an additional loss of $50,000.   (2) A delinquent loan with an outstanding balance of $1.2 million secured by an apartment building. The delinquency is the result of a lawsuit filed by the previous owner claiming that the debtor never owned record title to the mortgaged property. The Company filed a lawsuit seeking a declaration that the mortgage is a valid encumbrance against the property. A ruling on the Company’s motion for Preliminary Injunction and Motion for Lis Pendens is expected shortly. No trial date has been set, but we do not expect a trial date until early 2012. All payments of principal, interest and escrow are being paid to the trustee with taxes paid by the trustee. We do not anticipate a loss on this loan.   (3) Three mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $994,000, net of charge-offs of $326,000, secured by three separate apartment buildings. The Company has filed foreclosure actions on all three mortgages. Updated appraisals have been submitted to the court and a foreclosure sale is anticipated within six weeks. Based on the appraisals and projected cash flow analyses, the Company established specific allowances totaling $221,000 which are believed to be adequate. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust the specific reserves if necessary.   The one non-accrual mixed-use mortgage loan totaled $722,000 at December 31, 2011, consisting of the following mortgage loan:   (1) An outstanding balance of $722,000 secured by a mixed-use apartment building. The Company filed a foreclosure action and the court granted the Company’s request for the appointment of a receiver of rents for the property. The receiver’s managing agent delivered the appropriate notices to all tenants as required by law. We expect to move the Court for an order of foreclosure and sale and anticipate a sale date by July 2012.  We will continue to monitor the progress of the foreclosure action and make adjustments to the allowances accordingly.   The non-accrual non-residential mortgage loans, net of charge-offs of $400,000, totaled $6.6 million at December 31, 2011, consisting primarily of the following mortgage loans:   (1) An outstanding balance of $4.5 million secured by an office building containing 42,400 useable square feet. The Company holds both a foreclosure judgment authorizing a sheriff’s sale of the property and a money judgment against all obligors. The sheriff’s sale was originally scheduled for late December 2011, but we agreed to adjourn it for a month at a time under a forbearance agreement conditioned upon monthly tax escrow payments being made timely and all income in excess of the operating expenses being paid to the Bank. The forbearance agreement expires on April 30, 2012. We will monitor the cash flow and require continuing capital improvements be made to the building to allow it to better compete within its market. Based on a current appraisal and projected cash flow analysis, we do not anticipate a loss on this loan at this time.       45     Table of Contents        (2) An outstanding balance of $1.2 million secured by an office building. Based on a current appraisal and projected cash flow analysis, the Company established a specific allowance of $333,000 against the loan. We expect to foreclose on the loan in the next nine months and will continue to monitor the condition of the building and adjust the allowances accordingly.   The non-accrual construction mortgage loans, net of loans in process of $85,000, totaled $7.7 million at December 31, 2011, consisting of the following mortgage loans:   (1) Four construction mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of $7.7 million (net of loans in process of $85,000), representing a 25% interest in a participation loan, secured by a newly completed boutique hotel. Additional security consists of a general guarantee of the two principals and an assignment of LLC interests in two other properties. During the fourth quarter of 2010 and throughout 2011, the Company recorded specific allowances in the amount of $1.7 million to cover the anticipated loss on the sale of the notes and mortgages. In December 2011, the borrower and the participating banks reached an agreement to rewrite the total debt to $24,000,000. In return, the borrower has agreed to certain conditions, which include but are not limited to, paying all outstanding taxes, paying interest in advance for two years, turning over management of the hotel to an independent third party acceptable to the participating banks and other conditions set by the banks. The personal guarantees of the principals will remain. We anticipate the plan will be approved by the Court within four months. We will continue to monitor the operations of the hotel and adjust our allowance accordingly.   The one loan that is 90 days or more and still accruing is the following multi-family mortgage loan:   (1) A delinquent loan with an outstanding balance of $1.2 million secured by an apartment building. The borrower and all of the borrower’s related properties are operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and are making regularly scheduled payments as approved by the Trustee. We will continue to monitor the operations of the building and adjust the allowances accordingly.   Except for the above-mentioned second non-accrual multi-family mortgage loan, we are in the process of foreclosing on all of the identified multi-family, mix-use, non-residential, and construction properties. Based on recent fair value analyses of these properties, the Company does not expect any losses beyond the amounts already charged off or reserved for. Except for the above-mentioned second non-accrual multi-family mortgage loan, all of the identified loans have been classified as substandard.  The Company did not classify the above-mentioned second non-accrual multi-family mortgage loan because the asset is well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower and there is no evidence of potential weaknesses or deterioration of the asset.   Interest income that would have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 had non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to approximately $1.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Bank recognized interest income of approximately $59,000 on the nonaccrual loans.   At December 31, 2011, we owned one foreclosed property with a net balance of $620,000 consisting of a six unit multi-family building. We renovated this property and have leased two of the six units. We expect to market the property in the near future.   Federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable, and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. We recognize a loss as soon as a reasonable determination of that loss can be made. We directly charge, against earnings, that portion of the asset that is determined to be uncollectible. If an accurate determination of the loss is impossible, for any reason, we will establish an allowance in an amount sufficient to absorb the most probable loss expected. In cases where a reasonable determination of a loss cannot be made, we will adjust our allowance to reflect a potential loss until a more accurate determination can be made.       46     Table of Contents        The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated.               At December 31,               2011         2010         2009               (In thousands)                                                 Special mention assets       $ 4,259         $ 7,567         $ 33,221       Substandard assets         24,146           22,103           12,160       Doubtful and loss assets         —           —           —       Total classified assets       $ 28,405         $ 29,670         $ 45,381     The decrease in classified assets was due to the Company’s close monitoring of non-performing loans, despite the continued weakness in the economy adversely impacting the commercial and multi-family real estate markets. On the basis of management’s review of assets, we classified $4.3 million of our assets at December 31, 2011 as special mention or potential problem loans compared to $7.6 million classified as special mention at December 31, 2010. In addition, we classified $24.1 million at December 31, 2011 as substandard compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2010.   The decrease in special mention assets was due to the resolution of three multi-family mortgage loans and one nonresidential mortgage loan totaling $3.6 million that were performing at December 31, 2011 and the reclassification of three nonresidential mortgage loans totaling $3.1 million from special mention to substandard, offset by two multi-family mortgage loans and one mixed-used mortgage loan totaling $3.3 million that were newly classified as special mention.   The increase in substandard assets was due to six multi-family mortgage loans, one mixed-use mortgage loan, and one nonresidential mortgage loan totaling $5.1 million that were newly classified as substandard and three nonresidential mortgage loans totaling $3.1 million that were reclassified from special mention to substandard, offset by four multi-family mortgage loans and three construction mortgage loans totaling $6.4 million that were satisfied or performing.   We have charged off $326,000 in losses on these classified assets. In this regard, we have charged off $326,000 in losses for three substandard multi-family loans, resulting in a net total balance of $964,000.   The substandard loans at December 31, 2011 consisted of twenty loans in the aggregate – eight multi-family mortgage loans, one mixed-use mortgage loan, seven non-residential mortgage loans, and four construction mortgage loans. See the non-accrual loan discussion above for a description of the material non-accrual loans that are also classified as substandard multi-family mortgage loans, the one substandard mixed-use mortgage loan, four of the seven substandard non-residential mortgage loans, and the four substandard construction mortgage loans.   Additional substandard multi-family mortgage loans include one that was current, has an outstanding balance of $1.7 million, and is secured by a 6 unit apartment building, and a second that was eighteen months delinquent and accruing, has an outstanding balance of $1.2 million, and is secured by a 7 unit apartment building.   Additional substandard non-residential mortgage loans include one that was current, has an outstanding balance of $1.5 million, and is secured by seven unit office building, and a second that was current, has an outstanding balance of $1.1 million, and is secured by a gas station and car wash.   The remaining $6.0 million of accruing substandard loans consists of five multi-family and non-residential loans.       47     Table of Contents      Delinquencies .

The Bank has classified the delinquent multi-family loan as substandard at December 31, 2011 and the loan is included in the classified loan schedule listed above.   Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings. The recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are presented by management to the board of directors.   Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of: (1) a specific allowance on identified impaired and problem loans, if appropriate; and (2) a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.   Specific Allowance Required for Identified Impaired Loans. We establish an allowance on certain identified impaired loans when the loan balance exceeds the fair value, discounted cash flows or observable market price of the underlying collateral and when collection of the full amount outstanding becomes improbable.   General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Loan Portfolio . We establish a general allowance for pools of loans by loan class, including those that are not impaired and subject to specific allowances to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning a historical loss factor to each category. The historical loss factors are adjusted for qualitative factors that, in management’s judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. These qualitative factors may include changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas and the national economy, legal and regulatory issues, policies and procedures in underwriting standards, staff lending experience, recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio, collateral value, loan volumes and concentration, specific reserve and classified asset trends, delinquency trends and risk rating trends. These loss factors are subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment.   At December 31, 2011, our allowance for loan losses was $7.4 million and represented 2.07% of total gross loans. At December 31, 2010, our allowance for loan losses was $7.6 million and represented 2.06% of total gross loans. At December 31, 2009, our allowance for loan losses was $6.7 million and represented 1.72% of total gross loans. The primary reason for the decrease in allowance for loan losses from 2010 to 2011 was the decrease in total loans due mainly to decreases in non-residential real estate, mixed-use, and construction loans, offset by increases in commercial loans.       48     Table of Contents        The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.               At December 31,               2011         2010         2009               Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of  Loans in Category to Total Loans         Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of  Loans in Category to Total Loans         Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of  Loans in Category to Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Residential real estate:                                                                                                                 One- to four-family       $ —           0.0 %         0.2 %       $ —           0.0 %         0.1 %       $ —           0.0 %         0.1 %     Multi-family         3,390           45.8           52.9           3,450           45.1           51.1           3,350           49.8           51.3       Mixed-use         391           5.3           14.3           474           6.2           14.9           598           8.9           15.3       Non-residential real estate         1,596           21.6           23.4           1,560           20.4           27.1           2,495           37.0           26.8       Construction         1,724           23.3           2.5           2,083           27.2           3.5           186           2.8           3.9       Commercial and industrial         296           4.0           6.7           80           1.1           3.3           104           1.5           2.6       Consumer and other loans         —           0.0           0.0           —           0.0           0.0           —           0.0           0.0       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 7,397           100.0 %         100.0 %       $ 7,647           100.0 %         100.0 %       $ 6,733           100.0 %         100.0 %               At December 31,               2008         2007               Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of  Loans in Category to Total Loans         Amount         % of Allowance to Total Allowance         % of  Loans in Category to Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Residential real estate:                                                                             One- to four-family       $ —           0.0 %         0.1 %       $ —           0.0 %         0.1 %     Multi-family         604           32.4           51.1           472           31.7           49.0       Mixed-use         319           17.1           16.0           250           16.8           18.5       Non-residential real estate         841           45.1           28.2           691           46.4           28.0       Construction         21           1.1           2.5           50           3.4           3.3       Commercial and industrial         80           4.3           2.1           25           1.7           1.1       Consumer and other loans         —           0.0           0.0           —           0.0           0.0       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 1,865           100.0 %         100.0 %       $ 1,489           100.0 %         100.0 %   Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and our results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.       49     Table of Contents        Analysis of Loan Loss Experience.

We manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes: originating mortgage real estate loans that re-price to market interest rates in three to five years; purchasing securities that typically re-price within a three year time frame to limit exposure to market fluctuations; and, where appropriate, offering higher rates on long term certificates of deposit to lengthen the re-pricing time frame of our liabilities. We currently do not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments.   We have an Asset/Liability Committee, comprised of our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, executive vice president, chief retail banking officer, and treasurer, whose function is to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.       50     Table of Contents        Our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income.   Net Portfolio Value Analysis. We use a net portfolio value analysis to review our level of interest rate risk. This analysis measures interest rate risk by computing changes in net portfolio value of our cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. Net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities, with adjustments made for off-balance sheet items. These analyses assess the risk of loss in market risk-sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained 50 to 300 basis point increase or 50 and 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.   The following table presents the change in the net portfolio value of the Bank at December 31, 2011 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on certain assumptions, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counteract that change.               Net Portfolio Value (Dollars in thousands)         Net Portfolio Value as % of Portfolio Value of Assets       Basis Point (“bp”) Change in Rates       $ Amount         $ Change         % Change         NPV Ratio         Change                                                                         300       $ 97,472         $ (720 )         (1 )%         20.27 %         20  bp       200         97,927           (264 )         —           20.24 %         17  bp       100         98,234           43           —           20.19 %         12  bp       50         98,226           35           —           20.13 %         6  bp       0         98,191                                   20.07 %                 (50)         96,864           (1,327 )         (1 )         19.81 %         (26)  bp       (100)         95,720           (2,471 )         (3 )         19.59 %         (47)  bp     We use various assumptions in assessing interest rate risk. These assumptions relate to interest rates, loan prepayment rates, deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios, among others. As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re-pricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table. Prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income. Because of the large percentage of loans we hold, rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position. When interest rates rise, prepayments tend to slow. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to rise. Our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and vice versa. While we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future loan repayment activity.   Liquidity Management . Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.       51     Table of Contents        We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of: (1) expected loan demand; (2) expected deposit flows; (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities; and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management policy.   Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $82.6 million at December 31, 2011 and consist primarily of deposits at other financial institutions (Predominantly the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York) and miscellaneous cash items. Securities classified as available-for-sale provide an additional source of liquidity. Total securities classified as available-for-sale were $149,000 at December 31, 2011 and $162,000 at December 31, 2010.   At December 31, 2011, we had $28.5 million in loan commitments outstanding. At December 31, 2011, this consisted of $17.9 million in unused commercial and industrial loan lines of credit, $6.5 million of real estate loan origination commitments, $3.8 million in unused real estate equity lines of credit, $153,000 in unused consumer lines of credit, and $121,000 in construction loans in process. Certificates of deposit due within one year of December 31, 2011 totaled $97.1 million. This represented 68.1% of certificates of deposit at December 31, 2011. We believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers’ hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods in the current low interest rate environment. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before December 31, 2011. We believe, however, based on past experience, that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.   Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts. At December 31, 2011, we had the ability to borrow $69.5 million, net of $20.0 million in outstanding advances, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to maintain or increase our core deposit relationships depending on our level of real estate loan and commercial loan commitments outstanding. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits or to lengthen repricing time frames.   The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders. The Company’s liquidity may depend, in part, upon its receipt of dividends from the Bank because the Company has no source of income other than earnings from the investment of the net proceeds from its initial public offering. The amount of dividends that the Bank may declare and pay to the Company in any calendar year, without the receipt of prior approval from the Federal Reserve but with prior notice to the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income (as defined) for the preceding two calendar years. At December 31, 2011, the Company had liquid assets of $14.9 million.       52     Table of Contents        The following table presents our primary investing and financing activities during the periods indicated.               Year Ended December 31,               2011         2010         2009               (In thousands)       Investing activities:                                         Loans disbursed or closed       $ (52,276 )       $ (8,188 )       $ (40,326 )     Purchase of loan participations         —           —           (5,198 )     Loan principal repayments         62,527           25,979           17,583       Sale of loans         —           —           —       Proceeds from maturities and principal repayments of securities         4,699           14,526           392       Purchases of securities         (984 )         (22,568 )         (10,151 )     Purchase of bank owned life insurance         —           (5,000 )         (1,200 )     Proceeds from sale of premises and equipment         —           2,797           —       Purchases of premises and equipment         (2,828 )         (209 )         (4,552 )                                               Financing activities:                                         Increase (decrease) in deposits         26,806           (52,688 )         118,088       Proceeds from FHLB-NY advances         10,000           —           10,000       Repayment of FHLB-NY advances         (15,000 )         (10,000 )         (15,000 )   Capital Management. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. At December 31, 2011, we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements. We are considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.   The capital from our initial public offering increased our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, the sale of our First Avenue branch office building in the second quarter of 2007 further increased our capital in 2007. Over time, the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering and the sale of the branch office building are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of lending activities. Our financial condition has been enhanced by the capital from the offering, resulting in increased net interest-earning assets. However, the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the offering and the branch office building sale will, initially, have an adverse impact on our return on equity. From time to time, we may consider capital management tools such as cash dividends and common stock repurchases.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently have no plans to engage in hedging activities in the future.   For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices   The financial statements and related financial data presented in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.       53     Table of Contents            ITEM 7A.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   This section provides an analysis of the Corporation’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. The analysis should be read in conjunction with the related audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere herein.   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   This annual report contains certain “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which forward looking statements may be identified by the use of such words as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “plan,” “estimate,” and “potential.” Examples of forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, estimates with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Corporation that are subject to various factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include: changes in general economic and market conditions, legislative and regulatory conditions, or the development of an interest rate environment that adversely affects the Corporation’s interest rate spread or other income anticipated from operations and investments. As used in this annual report, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Stewardship Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiary, Atlantic Stewardship Bank, depending on the context. Introduction   The Corporation’s primary business is the ownership and supervision of the Bank and, through the Bank, the Corporation has been, and intends to continue to be, a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Corporation currently has 13 full service branches offices located in Bergen, Passaic and Morris counties in New Jersey. The Corporation conducts a general commercial and retail banking business encompassing a wide range of traditional deposit and lending functions along with the other customary banking services. The Corporation earns income and generates cash primarily through the deposit gathering activities of the branch network. These deposits gathered from the general public are then utilized to fund the Corporation’s lending and investing activities.   The Corporation has developed a strong deposit base with good franchise value. A mix of a variety of different deposit products and electronic services, along with a strong focus on customer service, is used to attract customers and build depositor relationships. Challenges facing the Corporation include our ability to continue to grow the branch deposit levels, provide adequate technology enhancements to achieve efficiencies, offer a competitive product line, and provide the highest level of customer service.   The Corporation is affected by the overall economic conditions in northern New Jersey, the interest rate and yield curve environment, and the overall national economy. These factors are relevant because they will affect our ability to attract specific deposit products, our ability to invest in loan and investment products, and our ability to earn acceptable profits without incurring increased risks.   When evaluating the financial condition and operating performance of the Corporation, management reviews historical trends, peer comparisons, asset and deposit concentrations, interest margin analysis, adequacy of loan loss reserve and loan quality performance, adequacy of capital under current positions as well as to support future expansion, adequacy of liquidity, and overall quality of earnings performance.   The branch network coupled with our online services provides for solid coverage in both existing and new markets in key towns in the three counties in which we operate. The Corporation continually evaluates the need to further develop the infrastructure to enable the entity to continue to build franchise value, expand its customer base, and offer appropriate products and services to its existing and future customer base.   In 2010 and 2011, the Corporation, like all financial institutions, continued to experience a difficult and complicated economic and operating environment. The Corporation’s results have been affected by the economic downturn through higher loan loss provisions and managing credit risk remains a significant challenge for the Bank. In addition, c ompetition in the northern New Jersey market remained intense and the challenges of operating throughout these years in a flat interest rate market continued to make it somewhat difficult to attract deposits at appropriate interest rate levels. While the Bank has seen growth in deposits, and although the area in which the Bank operates has not been as dramatically affected by the national economic downturn as other areas in the country, management continues to find strong competition for low cost, core deposits. Furthermore, while the current economic conditions and softness in the      14     Table of Contents      real estate market have contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies, new lending opportunities are being appropriately evaluated. The Corporation has not been involved in the subprime lending area.   In an effort to address the strong competition in attracting deposit balances, the Corporation continues to evaluate product and services offerings. In mid-February 2009 we introduced our Power Rate checking product. This account pays a premium rate of interest and refunds ATM fees charged by other financial institutions. In return, the customer has simple monthly qualification factors such as enrolling in online banking with electronic statements and minimum levels of debit card usage. Although balances in these deposits were relatively unchanged in 2011, this product contributed to the growth in deposits during 2010. Both 2010 and 2011 benefited from increased fee income related to debit cards and reduced expenses related to providing more cost effective electronic statements as customers’ acceptance of such increases.   Improvements and upgrades of our electronic / online banking products and services continue to be a priority. During 2009 we introduced an online banking / cash management product as well as remote deposit capture services for businesses. Additional development and testing of technology included the introduction of mobile banking for consumers in 2010. The rollout of a smartphone application is expected by the spring of 2012. Steps toward the introduction of mobile deposit capture are well underway. Plans for the offering of business mobile banking are in place.   Beginning in mid-2010 the Corporation began to experience an increase in mortgage loan refinance activity due to the Corporation’s promotion of a ‘no cost closing’ program and the lower rate environment. This activity has allowed the Corporation to sell a larger volume into the secondary market resulting in increased gains from the sale of mortgage loans. In addition to concentrating on increasing noninterest income, expense control is always a focus. However, the increase in noninterest expense for 2011 is reflective of the increase in mortgage loan activity and expenses associated with the management of nonperforming assets.   In September 2011, the Corporation received $15 million in connection with its participation in the Treasury’s Small Business Lending Fund (“SBLF”) program. In exchange, the Corporation issued to the Treasury 15,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B. The Corporation used the proceeds to simultaneously repurchase the Corporation’s shares of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A previously issued under the Treasury’s Troubled Assets Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”). In addition, the Corporation completed the repurchase of a warrant held by the Treasury that had been issued as part of the Corporation's participation in the TARP CPP. The additional capital provided by the SBLF further solidified our already well capitalized position, thereby enhancing our ability to continue to grow assets and increasing our ability to make new loans. Accordingly, we can better serve the lending needs of consumers and businesses in our market.   Despite facing unprecedented economic challenges in 2010 and 2011, the Corporation reported a net profit for each of the years. The Corporation will continue to concentrate its efforts on improving asset quality, developing its existing branch network, introducing new products and services, capitalizing on technology and focusing on improved efficiencies during 2012.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   A discussion of recent pronouncements and their effect on the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements can be found in Note 1 of the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation,” as well as disclosures found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are based upon the Corporation’s audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Corporation to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 contains a summary of the Corporation’s significant accounting policies. Management believes the Corporation’s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments, which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. Changes in these judgments, assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations. This critical policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.       15     Table of Contents      The allowance for loan losses is based upon management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance, including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio, giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, level of delinquencies, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans, and current economic and market conditions. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate, which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the majority of the Corporation’s loans are secured by real estate in the State of New Jersey. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the Corporation’s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the northern New Jersey area experience adverse economic changes. Future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory and other conditions beyond the Corporation’s control.   Earnings Summary   The Corporation reported net income of $684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.2 million for 2010. The decrease in earnings during 2011 is primarily related to a higher provision for loan loss. After dividends on preferred stock and accretion, net income available to common stockholders was $126,000 for 2011, or $0.02 per diluted common share, compared to $683,000, or $0.12 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2010. The return on average assets was 0.10% in 2011 compared to 0.18% in 2010. The return on average common equity decreased to 0.29% for 2011 from 1.55% in 2010.   Results of Operations   Net Interest Income   The Corporation’s principal source of revenue is the net interest income derived from the Bank, which represents the difference between the interest earned on assets and interest paid on funds acquired to support those assets. Net interest income is affected by the balances and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in their corresponding yields and costs, and by the volume of interest-earning assets funded by noninterest-bearing deposits. The Corporation’s principal interest-earning assets are loans made to businesses and individuals and investment securities.   For the year ended December 31, 2011, net interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased to $25.2 million from $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, reflecting an increase of $421,000, or 1.7%. The increase in the current year is primarily due to a decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 3.58% and 3.83%, respectively, compared to 3.57% and 3.89% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The net interest rate spread and net yield on interest earning assets for the current year reflect a decline in loan interest rates and yields on securities as well as a decline in the interest rates on deposits. The Corporation continues in its efforts to proactively manage deposit costs in an effort to mitigate the lower asset yields earned. The reduced yields on assets are partially attributable to historically low market rates in the current environment.   For the year ended December 31, 2011, total interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, decreased $1.4 million, or 4.2%, when compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to a decrease in yields on interest-earning assets partially offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets. The average rate earned on interest-earning assets decreased 38 basis points from 5.27% for the year ended December 31, 2010 to 4.89% in the current year. The decline in the asset yield reflects the effect of a prolonged low interest rate environment as well as the impact of nonaccrual loans, including those transferred to nonaccrual during the current year. Average interest-earning assets increased $20.8 million in 2011, or 3.3%, over the 2010 amount with average loans increasing $1.1 million and investment securities increasing $19.9 million.   Interest expense decreased $1.8 million, or 20.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2011 to $7.0 million. The decrease was attributable to a decline in the average rate paid on deposits partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.31% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 1.70% during 2010, reflecting a general decline in rates paid on deposits. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $529.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting an increase of $12.3 million, or 2.4%, when compared to $517.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in average interest-bearing     16     Table of Contents      liabilities is primarily attributable to the Corporation’s expanding customer base. The Corporation continues to supplement its branch deposit network with a mix of wholesale repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. The Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings in particular provide an alternative funding source help to lower cost of funds and provide for better management of interest rate risk. There were no brokered certificates of deposit utilized during 2011.             17     Table of Contents      The following table reflects the components of the Corporation’s net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 including: (1) average assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity based on average daily balances, (2) interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, (3) average yields earned on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, and (4) net yield on interest-earning assets. Nontaxable income from investment securities and loans is presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a statutory tax rate of 34% for the years presented. This was accomplished by adjusting non-taxable income upward to make it equivalent to the level of taxable income required to earn the same amount after taxes.               2011       2010       2009

The table reflects the extent to which changes in the Corporation’s interest income and interest expense are attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior year rate) and changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior year volume). Changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to changes due to volume and changes due to rate.               2011 Versus 2010       2010 Versus 2009             (In thousands)                                                                   Increase (Decrease)               Increase (Decrease)                     Due to Change in               Due to Change in                     Volume       Rate       Net       Volume       Rate       Net     Interest income:                                                                                                                                                            Loans       $ 64         $ (1,043 )       $ (979 )       $ 905         $ (550 )       $ 355        Taxable investment securities         589           (1,057 )         (468 )         157           (1,695 )         (1,538 )      Tax-exempt investment securities         53           (15 )         38           55           (58 )         (3 )      Other interest-earning assets         (24 )         40           16           30           (13 )         17                                                                                        Total interest-earning assets         682           (2,075 )         (1,393 )         1,147           (2,316 )         (1,169 )                                                                                   Interest expense:                                                                                                                                                            Interest-bearing demand deposits         132           (1,296 )         (1,164 )         590           (235 )         355        Savings deposits         17           (50 )         (33 )         22           (59 )         (37 )      Time deposits         22           (589 )         (567 )         (579 )         (1,908 )         (2,487 )      Repurchase agreements         1           (2 )         (1 )         (5 )         (13 )         (18 )      FHLB borrowings         (133 )         28           (105 )         (145 )         136           (9 )      Subordinated debentures         -           56           56           -           163           163                                                                                        Total interest-bearing liabilities         39           (1,853 )         (1,814 )         (117 )         (1,916 )         (2,033 )                                                                                   Net change in net interest income       $ 643         $ (222 )       $ 421         $ 1,264         $ (400 )       $ 864     Provision for Loan Losses   The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered by management to be adequate to cover the probable incurred losses associated with its loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis, management analyzes the adequacy of this allowance by considering the nature and volume of the Corporation’s loan activity, financial condition of the borrower, fair market value of underlying collateral, and changes in general market conditions. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operations in the appropriate period. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, serve to reduce the allowance. The appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from current estimates.   The loan loss provision of $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 was higher than the $9.6 million loan loss provision recorded for the year ended December 31, 2010. The allowance for loan loss was $11.6 million, or 2.54% of total loans as of December 31, 2011 compared to $8.5 million, or 1.88% of total loans a year earlier.   The loan loss provision takes into account growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in nonperforming loans as well as the impact of chargeoffs. In determining the level of the allowance for loan loss, the Corporation also considered the types of loans as well as the overall seasoning of new loans to determine the risk that was inherent in the portfolio.   Nonaccrual loans increased from $22.5 million, or 4.98% of total loans, at December 31, 2010 to $27.7 million, or 6.08% of total loans at December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Corporation charged off loans totaling $7.8 million compared to loans charged off of $8.1 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses related to the impaired loans increased from $1.6 million at December 31, 2010 to $3.1 million at December 31, 2011 due, in part, to chargeoffs down to the net realizable value of collateral for some of the impaired loans.     19     Table of Contents        In addition to these factors, the Corporation evaluated the economic conditions and overall real estate climate in the primary business markets in which it operates when considering the overall risk of the lending portfolio. The asset quality issues, caused by the national economic downturn which began in 2008, and the current year chargeoffs and provision for loan losses are reflective of current economic conditions that contributed to an increase in loan delinquencies and the softness in the real estate market. The Corporation monitors its loan portfolio and intends to continue to provide for loan loss reserves based on its ongoing periodic review of the loan portfolio and general market conditions.   Noninterest Income   Noninterest income consists of all income other than interest income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits, income derived from bank owned life insurance, gain on sales of mortgage loans and income derived from debit cards and ATM usage. In addition, gains from calls and sales of securities are reflected as noninterest income.   Noninterest income increased $773,000 to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $4.4 million for the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2011, noninterest income included $1.2 million from gains on calls and sales of securities compared to $1.1 million in 2010. Gains on sales of mortgage loans totaled $1.2 million for 2011, an increase from $671,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulting from lower mortgage loan interest rates and the Corporation’s promotion of a no cost closing program. The increase in the activity for the current year resulted in an increase in the volume of loans sold and ultimately, an increase in gains on mortgages sold.   Noninterest Expense   Noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were $18.7 million and $17.9 million, respectively. Noninterest expense for 2011 reflects higher salary and employee benefits expense, reflective of the increase in mortgage loan activity and associated with the management of nonperforming assets. Partially offsetting these expense increases is a decrease in the FDIC insurance premiums reflecting a recent change in the quarterly assessment base.   Income Taxes   For the year ended December 31, 2011, income taxes represented a benefit of $415,000 compared to a benefit of $165,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The tax benefit for both years reflects a decrease in our overall projected effective tax rate as a result of our tax exempt income representing a larger percentage of pretax income due to lower earnings.   Financial Condition   Total assets at December 31, 2011 were $708.8 million, an increase of $20.7 million, or 2.9%, over the $688.1 million at December 31, 2010. This increase in assets reflects, among other things, a $32.3 million increase in securities available for sale and a $4.7 million increase in other real estate owned partially offset by a $6.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, a $7.0 million decrease in securities held to maturity and a $5.1 million decrease in mortgage loans held for sale.   Loan Portfolio   The Corporation’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, net of allowance for loan losses, totaled $444.8 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or less than a 1% increase over the $443.2 million at December 31, 2010. Residential real estate mortgages increased $12.5 million. Although the Corporation continued its policy of selling the majority of its residential real estate loans in the secondary market, certain residential real estate loans were placed into portfolio to partially compensate for payoffs and normal amortization. Of the loans sold, all have been sold with servicing of the loan transferring to the purchaser. Commercial real estate mortgage loans consisting of $259.5 million, or 56.8% of the total portfolio, represent the largest portion of the loan portfolio. These loans reflected an increase of $10.9 million from $248.5 million, or 55.0% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2010. Commercial loans decreased $7.0 million to $102.5 million, representing 22.5% of the total loan portfolio. Consumer installment loans and home equity loans decreased $8.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, partially attributable to borrowers continuing to consolidate secondary liens on their homes as they refinance in the lower interest rate environment.       20     Table of Contents      The Corporation’s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern New Jersey and therefore collectability of the loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in the northern New Jersey market. The Corporation has not made loans to borrowers outside the United States.   At December 31, 2011, aside from the real estate concentration described above, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans outstanding. Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other related conditions.   The following table sets forth the classification of the Corporation’s loans by major category at the end of each of the last five years:               December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               (In thousands)       Real estate mortgage:                                                                     Residential (1)       $ 54,946         $ 43,020         $ 36,246         $ 40,337         $ 44,719           Commercial (1)         259,462           248,527           246,212           226,183           209,082                                                                         Commercial loans         102,500           109,527           114,893           100,282           89,845                                                                         Consumer loans:                                                                     Installment (2)         21,310           29,522           41,006           51,290           56,796           Home equity         17,889           20,965           21,779           21,208           19,723           Other         306           305           340           356           424                                                                         Total gross loans         456,413           451,866           460,476           439,656           420,589       Less: Allowance for loan losses         11,604           8,490           6,920           5,166           4,457                Deferred loan fees         6           131           437           387           442       Net loans       $ 444,803         $ 443,245         $ 453,119         $ 434,103         $ 415,690               (1)  Includes construction loans.

Inherent in the lending function is the risk of deterioration in a borrower’s ability to repay loans under existing loan agreements. Management realizes that because of this risk, reserves are maintained to absorb probable incurred loan losses. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management of the Corporation considers the risks inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of its loan activities, along with general economic and real estate market conditions. Although management attempts to establish a reserve sufficient to offset probable incurred losses in the portfolio, changes in economic conditions, regulatory policies and borrower’s performance could require future changes to the allowance.   In establishing the allowance for loan losses, the Corporation utilizes a two tier approach by (1) identifying problem loans and allocating specific loss allowances to such loans and (2) establishing a general valuation allowance on the remainder of its loan portfolio. The Corporation maintains a loan review system that allows for a periodic review of its loan portfolio and the early identification of potential problem loans. Such a system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers.   The Corporation’s accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 to the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The application of some of these policies requires significant management judgment and the utilization of estimates. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates resulting in a significant impact on the financial statements. A critical accounting policy for the Corporation is the policy utilized in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short-term change. Various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require the Corporation to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, the Corporation’s lending activities are concentrated in loans secured by real estate located in northern New Jersey. Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Corporation’s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in real estate market conditions in northern New Jersey. Future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporation’s control. In management’s opinion, the allowance for loan losses totaling $11.6 million is adequate to cover probable incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at December 31, 2011.   Nonperforming Assets   Risk elements include nonaccrual loans, past due and restructured loans, potential problem loans, loan concentrations and other real estate owned (i.e., property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure). The Corporation’s loans are generally placed in a nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of 90 days as to payment of principal and interest or earlier if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Interest previously accrued on these loans and not yet paid is charged against income during the current period. Interest earned thereafter is only included in income to the extent that it is received in cash. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing represent those loans which are sufficiently collateralized and management believes all interest and principal owed will be collected. Restructured loans are loans that have been renegotiated to permit a borrower, who has incurred adverse financial circumstances, to continue to perform. Management can make concessions to the terms of the loan or reduce the contractual interest rates to below market rates in order for the borrower to continue to make payments.       22     Table of Contents      The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Corporation’s nonperforming assets as of December 31 of each of the preceding five years:               December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               (Dollars in thousands)       Nonaccrual loans: (1)                                                                     Construction       $ 8,092         $ 2,303         $ 8,581         $ 2,575         $ -           Residential real estate         779           1,106           1,131           -           -           Commercial real estate         9,302           10,540           5,109           291           73           Commercial         8,672           7,722           3,638           825           307           Consumer         891           829           1,197           539           75                Total nonaccrual loans         27,736           22,500           19,656           4,230           455                                                                         Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing: (2)                                                                     Construction         -           -           415           -           -           Commercial real estate         -           -           -           -           -           Commercial         -           -           -           353           25           Consumer         -           -           -           -           1       Total loans past due ninety days or more and accruing         -           -           415           353           26                                                                         Total nonperforming loans         27,736           22,500           20,071           4,583           481       Other real estate owed         5,288           615           -           -           -       Total nonperforming assets       $ 33,024         $ 23,115         $ 20,071         $ 4,583         $ 481                                                                         Restructured loans: (3)                                                                     Construction       $ 561         $ -         $ -         $ -         $ -           Commercial real estate         3,386           -           665           1,483           -           Commercial         2,032           130           2,181           372           -                Total restructured loans       $ 5,979         $ 130         $ 2,846         $ 1,855         $ -                                                                         Allowance for loan losses       $ 11,604         $ 8,490         $ 6,920         $ 5,166         $ 4,457                                                                         Nonaccrual loans to total gross loans         6.08 %         4.98 %         4.27 %         0.96 %         0.11 %                                                                       Nonperforming loans to total gross loans         6.08 %         4.98 %         4.36 %         1.04 %         0.11 %                                                                       Nonperforming assets to total assets         4.66 %         3.36 %         3.02 %         0.75 %         0.08 %                                                                       Allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans         41.84 %         37.73 %         34.48 %         112.72 %         926.61 %                                                                   (1) Restructured loans classified in the nonaccrual category totaled $9.1 million, $4.0 million, $23,000, $22,000 and $73,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008 and, 2007, respectively. (2) There were no restructured loans classified in the past due 90 days or more and accruing for any years presented. (3) Any restructured loans that are on nonaccrual status are only reported in nonaccrual loans and not also in restructured loans.   A loan is generally placed on nonaccrual when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The identification of nonaccrual loans reflects careful monitoring of the loan portfolio. The Corporation has been diligent and proactive in identifying and dealing with problem credits and is focused on resolving the nonperforming loans and mitigating future losses in the portfolio. All delinquent loans continue to be reviewed by management.   At December 31, 2011, the nonaccrual loans were comprised of 95 loans, primarily commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and construction loans. While the Corporation maintains strong underwriting requirements, the number and amount of nonaccrual loans is reflective of the prolonged weakened economic conditions and the corresponding effects it has had on our commercial borrowers and the current real estate environment. Certain loans,      23     Table of Contents      including restructured loans, are current, but in accordance with applicable guidance and cautious review, management has continued to keep these loans on nonaccrual.   Since December 31, 2010, nonperforming loans have increased $5.2 million to $27.7 million at December 31, 2011. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans increased to 41.84% at December 31, 2011 from 37.73% at December 31, 2010. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans is reflective of detailed analysis and the probable incurred losses we have identified with these nonperforming loans. In calculating this metric, the effect of an increase in the allowance for loan losses has been partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans.   Evaluation of all nonperforming loans includes the updating of appraisals and specific evaluation of such loans to determine estimated cash flows from business and/or collateral. We have assessed these loans for collectability and considered, among other things, the borrower’s ability to repay, the value of the underlying collateral, and other market conditions to ensure the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses. The majority of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral. While our nonperforming loans have remained elevated, we have recorded appropriate chargeoffs and the underlying collateral coverage for a considerable portion of the nonperforming loans currently supports the significant collection of our remaining principal.   For loans not included in nonperforming loans, at December 31, 2011, the level of loans past due 30-89 days was $1.0 million, an improvement from $12.4 million at December 31, 2010. We will continue to monitor delinquencies for early identification of new problem loans. While not a significantly large portfolio, a large number of problem loans are commercial construction loans which have been affected by the struggling construction industry. As such, the entire commercial construction portfolio is being actively monitored.   The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level considered by management to be adequate to cover the probable incurred losses associated with its loan portfolio. The Corporation’s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments.   The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management’s evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the portfolio, consideration of the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, the level of delinquencies, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans, and current economic and market conditions.   Primarily as a result of the continuing higher level of nonperforming loans, the Corporation continues to record an elevated provision for loan losses. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the provision for loan losses was $10.845 million and $9.575 million, respectively. The total allowance for loan losses increased to 2.54% of total loans from a comparable ratio of 1.88% at December 31, 2010.   At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Corporation had $15.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of loans whose terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Of these loans, $6.0 million and $130,000 were performing in accordance with their new terms at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The remaining troubled debt restructures are reported as nonaccrual loans. Specific reserves of $1.2 million have been allocated for the troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2011. No reserves for trouble debt restructurings were deemed necessary at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the Corporation has committed $416,000 of additional funds to a single customer with an outstanding construction loan that is classified as a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2010, there were no additional funds committed on outstanding loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings.   Included in performing restructured loans as of December 31, 2011 is a loan for $2.3 million for which the estate of our borrower was provided with a forbearance to allow time to market for sale the underlying commercial real estate collateral. There is a signed contract for the sale of the property and upon closing of the sale transaction, the Corporation should collect all outstanding principal and accrued interest owed under the loan.   The December 31, 2011 balance in performing restructured loans also includes two loans to a related borrower for $1.1 million. While these loans are current under their restructured terms, because of the below market rate of interest, these loans will continue to be reflected as restructured loans in accordance with accounting practices.       24     Table of Contents      For the year ended December 31, 2011, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the restructured and non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $1.6 million, of which $0.2 million was included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011.   Allocations of specific loan loss allowances are established for identified loans based on a review of various information including appraisals of underlying collateral. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of impaired, collateral-dependent loans. Appraisals are periodically updated to ascertain any further decline in value. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loss experience, composition of loan portfolio, current economic conditions and management’s judgment.   When it is probable that some portion or all of a loan balance will not be collected, that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net chargeoffs were $7.7 million. While many of the nonaccrual loans continue to make normal monthly payments, larger chargeoffs resulted from the borrowers’ inability to provide adequate documentation that they could continue to service their debt. Therefore, consideration has been given to any underlying collateral and appropriate chargeoffs recorded based, in general, on the deficiency of such collateral. In general, the chargeoffs reflect partial writedowns and full chargeoffs on nonaccrual loans due to the initial evaluation of market values of the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310-40. While we have taken the conservative position of partial and full chargeoffs on loans, we continue to aggressively pursue collection, including legal action.   As of December 31, 2011, there were $36.1 million of other loans not included in the above table, compared to $23.9 million at December 31, 2010, where credit conditions of borrowers caused management to have concerns about the possibility of the borrowers not complying with the present terms and conditions of repayment and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming loans at a future date. These loans have been considered by management in conjunction with the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.             25     Table of Contents      The following table sets forth, for each of the preceding five years, the historical relationships among the amount of loans outstanding, the allowance for loan losses, the provision for loan losses, the amount of loans charged off and the amount of loan recoveries:               December 31,               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               (Dollars in thousands)                                                               Balance at beginning of period       $ 8,490         $ 6,920         $ 5,166         $ 4,457         $ 4,101                                                                         Loans charged off:                                                                   Construction         839           1,231           1,003           -           -         Residential real estate         112           25           85           -           -         Commercial real estate         1,911           1,241           -           -           -         Commercial         4,603           5,082           623           2,841           82         Consumer         304           519           215           61           103            Total loans charged off         7,769           8,098           1,926           2,902           185                                                                         Recoveries of loans previously charged off:                                                                   Construction         3           72           -           -           -         Commercial         29           10           93           -           -         Consumer         6           11           12           26           11            Total recoveries of loans previously charged off         38           93           105           26           11                                                                         Net loans charged off         7,731           8,005           1,821           2,876           174       Provisions charged to operations         10,845           9,575           3,575           3,585           530       Balance at end of period       $ 11,604         $ 8,490         $ 6,920         $ 5,166         $ 4,457                                                                         Net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period         1.67 %         1.74 %         0.41 %         0.66 %         0.05 %                                                                       Balance of allowance for loan losses at the end of year to gross year end loans         2.54 %         1.88 %         1.50 %         1.18 %         1.06 %   The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses, for each of the preceding five years, as indicated by loan categories:               2011         2010         2009         2008         2007               Amount         Percent  to Total  (1)         Amount         Percent  to Total  (1)         Amount         Percent  to Total  (1)         Amount         Percent  to Total  (1)         Amount         Percent  to Total  (1)               (Dollars in thousands)       Real estate – Residential       $ 303           12.0 %       $ 188           9.5 %       $ 155           7.9 %       $ 245           9.2 %       $ 256           10.6 %     Real estate – commercial         5,423           56.8 %         4,038           55.0 %         2,677           53.5 %         2,164           51.4 %         1,900           49.7 %     Commercial         5,368           22.5 %         3,745           24.2 %         3,148           24.9 %         2,086           22.8 %         1,640           21.4 %     Consumer         500           8.7 %         512           11.3 %         940           13.7 %         671           16.6 %         661           18.3 %     Unallocated         10                   - %         7                   - %         -                   - %         -                   - %         -                 - %     Total allowance for loan losses       $ 11,604           100.0 %       $ 8,490           100.0 %       $ 6,920           100.0 %       $ 5,166           100.0 %       $ 4,457           100.0 %                                                                                                                               (1) Represents percentage of loan balance in category to total gross loans.   Investment Portfolio   The Corporation maintains an investment portfolio to enhance its yields and to provide a secondary source of liquidity. The portfolio is comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government and agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities, state and political subdivision obligations and other equity investments, and has been classified as held to maturity or available for sale. Investments in debt securities that the Corporation has the positive intent and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost. All other securities are      26     Table of Contents      classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized holding gains or losses reported in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Securities in the available for sale category may be held for indefinite periods of time and include securities that management intends to use as part of its Asset/Liability strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment risks, the need to provide liquidity, the need to increase regulatory capital or similar factors. Securities available for sale increased to $170.9 million at December 31, 2011, from $138.6 million at December 31, 2010, an increase of $32.3 million, or 23.3%. The increase in securities available for sale reflects the Corporation’s focus on liquidity in the current economic environment. Securities held to maturity decreased $7.0 million, or 15.5%, to $38.4 million at December 31, 2011 from $45.4 million at December 31, 2010.   The following table sets forth the classification of the Corporation’s investment securities by major category at the end of the last three years:               December 31,             2011       2010       2009             Carrying  Value       Percent       Carrying  Value       Percent       Carrying  Value       Percent             (Dollars in thousands)     Securities available for sale:                                                                                 U.S. Treasury       $ 4,050           2.4 %       $ 9,249           6.7 %       $ -           -%           U.S. government-sponsored agencies         20,744           12.1           13,586           9.8           32,286           31.3           Obligations of state and                                                                                   political subdivisions         9,318           5.4           4,279           3.1           5,397           5.3           Mortgage-backed securities-residential         133,467           78.1           108,327           78.1           62,228           60.4           Other equity investments         3,346           2.0           3,187           2.3           3,115           3.0       Total       $ 170,925           100.0 %       $ 138,628           100.0 %       $ 103,026           100.0 %                                                                                   Securities held to maturity:                                                                                 U.S. government-sponsored agencies       $ 2,770           7.2 %       $ 4,208           9.3 %       $ 19,921           29.4 %         Obligations of state and                                                                                   political subdivisions         24,575           64.1           26,148           57.6           27,038           39.9           Mortgage-backed securities-residential         11,009           28.7           15,038           33.1           20,758           30.7       Total       $ 38,354           100.0 %       $ 45,394           100.0 %       $ 67,717           100.0 %   The following table sets forth the maturity distribution and weighted average yields (calculated on the basis of stated yields to maturity, considering applicable premium or discount) of the Corporation’s debt securities available for sale as of December 31, 2011.

The Corporation relied on its branch network and current competitive products and services to provide growth during 2011. There were no brokered certificates of deposit at December 31, 2011 or 2010.   The following table sets forth the classification of the Corporation’s deposits by major category as of December 31 of each of the three preceding years:               December 31,             2011       2010       2009             Amount       Percent       Amount       Percent       Amount       Percent             (Dollars in thousands)                                                           Noninterest-bearing demand       $ 115,776           19.5 %       $ 99,723           17.3 %       $ 88,427           16.7 %     Interest-bearing demand         249,058           41.9 %         248,240           43.1 %         218,284           41.2 %     Saving deposits         57,967           9.8 %         47,692           8.3 %         45,783           8.6 %     Certificates of deposit         170,751           28.8 %         179,948           31.3 %         177,436           33.5 %            Total       $ 593,552           100.0 %       $ 575,603           100.0 %       $ 529,930           100.0 %   As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of outstanding time deposits issued in amounts of $100,000 or more, broken down by time remaining to maturity, was as follows (In thousands):       Three     months or less       $ 14,867       Four     months through six months         15,024       Seven     months through twelve months         19,361       Over     twelve months         53,096                         Total       $ 102,348     Borrowings   Although deposits with the Bank are the Corporation’s primary source of funds, the Corporation’s policy has been to utilize borrowings to the extent that they are a less costly source of funds, when the Corporation desires additional capacity to fund loan demand, or to extend the life of its liabilities as a means of managing exposure to interest rate risk. The Corporation’s borrowings are a combination of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB-NY”), including overnight repricing lines of credit, and, to a lesser extent, securities sold under agreement to repurchase.       28     Table of Contents      Interest Rate Sensitivity   Interest rate movements have made managing the Corporation’s interest rate sensitivity increasingly important. The Corporation attempts to maintain stable net interest margins by generally matching the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities maturing, or subject to repricing, by adjusting interest rates to market conditions, and by developing new products. One method of measuring the Corporation’s exposure to changes in interest rates is the maturity and repricing gap analysis. The difference or mismatch between the amount of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice in a given period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap. A “negative” gap results when the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period of time. Conversely, a “positive” gap results when the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing exceed the amount of interest-bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same given time frame. The smaller the gap, the less the effect of the market volatility on net interest income. During a period of rising interest rates, an institution with a negative gap position would not be in as favorable a position, as compared to an institution with a positive gap, to invest in higher yielding assets. This may result in yields on its assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in its costs of interest-bearing liabilities than if it had a positive gap. During a period of falling interest rates, an institution with a negative gap would experience a repricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest-bearing liabilities, which consequently may result in its net interest income growing at a faster rate than an institution with a positive gap position.                   29     Table of Contents      The following table sets forth estimated maturity/repricing structure of the Corporation’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as of December 31, 2011. The amounts of assets or liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of each asset or liability and adjusted for prepayment assumptions where applicable. The table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the Corporation’s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities, for example, prepayments of loans and withdrawal of deposits, is beyond the Corporation’s control. As a result, certain assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within a period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels.               Three Months or Less       More than Three Months Through One Year       After One Year       Noninterest Sensitive       Total             (Dollars in thousands)                                                   Assets:                                                                  Loans:                                                                     Real estate mortgage       $ 24,525         $ 40,862         $ 249,021         $ -         $ 314,408           Commercial         51,486           12,480           38,534           -           102,500           Consumer         18,182           2,450           18,873           -           39,505        Mortgage loans held for sale         4,711           -           -           -           4,711        Investment securities (1)         20,091           33,211           158,455           -           211,757        Other assets         409           -           -           35,528           35,937                Total assets       $ 119,404         $ 89,003         $ 464,883         $ 35,528         $ 708,818                                                                         Source of funds:                                                                  Interest-bearing demand       $ 249,058         $ -         $ -         $ -         $ 249,058        Savings         57,967           -           -           -           57,967        Certificate of deposit         26,851           61,344           82,556           -           170,751        FHLB of NY advances         4,700           3,000           25,000           -           32,700        Repurchase agreements         14,000           342           -           -           14,342        Subordinated debenture         -           -           7,217           -           7,217        Other liabilities         -           -           -           118,991           118,991        Stockholders' equity         -           -           -           57,792           57,792                 Total source of funds       $ 352,576         $ 64,686         $ 114,773         $ 176,783         $ 708,818                                                                         Interest rate sensitivity gap       $ (233,172 )       $ (24,317 )       $ 350,110         $ (141,255 )                 Cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap       $ (233,172 )       $ (208,855 )       $ 141,255         $ -                                                                                     Ratio of GAP to total assets         -32.9 %         3.4 %         49.4 %         -19.9 %                 Ratio of cumulative GAP assets to total assets         -32.9 %         -29.5 %         19.9 %         - %                   (1)  Includes securities held to maturity, securities available for sale and FHLB-NY stock.   The Corporation also uses a simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates. The simulation model projects net interest income, net income, net interest margin, and capital to asset ratios based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve-month period. The model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of all rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Management incorporates into the model certain assumptions regarding prepayments of certain assets and liabilities. Assumptions have been built into the model for prepayments for assets and decay rates for nonmaturity deposits such as savings and interest bearing demand. The model assumes an immediate rate shock to interest rates without management’s ability to proactively change the mix of assets or liabilities. Based on the reports generated for December 31, 2011, an immediate interest rate increase of 200 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of 8.8%, or $2.3 million, and an immediate interest rate decrease of 200 basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income of 5.3% or $1.4 million. Management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on the Corporation’s net interest income.     30     Table of Contents      Liquidity   The Corporation’s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and funds provided by operations. While scheduled loan and mortgage-backed securities amortization and maturities of investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flow and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition.   The Corporation’s liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of its operating, investing and financing activities. These activities are summarized below:               Years Ended December 31,             2011       2010             (In thousands)     Cash and cash equivalents – beginning       $ 19,983         $ 8,871       Operating activities:                                Net income         684           1,233          Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities         15,385           (698 )     Net cash provided by operating activities         16,069           535       Net cash used in investing activities         (40,160 )         (13,643 )     Net cash provided by financing activities         17,806           24,220       Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents         (6,285 )         11,112       Cash and cash equivalents – ending       $ 13,698         $ 19,983     Cash was generated by operating activities in each of the above periods. The primary source of cash from operating activities during each period was net income.   Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as federal funds sold.   The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit, such as letters of credit, which are not reflected in the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.   The Corporation has various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. The following table summarizes the Corporation’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.                       Payment Due By Period             Total       Less than  1 Year       1 – 3  Years       4 – 5  Years       After 5  Years             (In thousands)     Contractual obligations                                                                    Operating lease obligations       $ 4,299         $ 920         $ 1,561         $ 514         $ 1,304       Total contracted cost obligations       $ 4,299         $ 920         $ 1,561         $ 514         $ 1,304                                                                         Other long-term liabilities/long-term debt                                                                    Time deposits       $ 170,751         $ 87,829         $ 72,365         $ 10,557         $ -          Federal Home Loan Bank advances         32,700           7,700           5,000           10,000           10,000          Securities sold under agreements to    repurchase         14,342           342           14,000           -           -          Subordinated debentures         7,217           -           -           -           7,217       Total other long-term liabilities/long-term debt       $ 225,010         $ 95,871         $ 91,365         $ 20,557         $ 17,217                                                                         Other commitments - off balance sheet                                                                    Letters of credit       $ 1,552         $ 1,287         $ 265         $ -         $ -          Commitments to extend credit         15,838           15,838           -           -           -          Unused lines of credit         67,504           67,504           -           -           -       Total off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations       $ 84,894         $ 84,629         $ 265         $ -         $ -                                                                         31     Table of Contents        Management believes that a significant portion of the time deposits will remain with the Corporation. In addition, management does not believe that all of the unused lines of credit will be exercised. We anticipate that the Corporation will have sufficient funds available to meet its current contractual commitments. Should we need temporary funding, the Corporation has the ability to borrow overnight with the FHLB-NY. The overall borrowing capacity is contingent on available collateral to secure borrowings and the ability to purchase additional activity-based capital stock of the FHLB-NY. In addition, the Corporation had available overnight variable repricing lines of credit with other correspondent banks totaling $16 million on an unsecured basis.   The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Corporation uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.   Of the $1.6 million commitments under standby and commercial letters of credit, $1.3 million expire within one year. Should any letter of credit be drawn on, the interest rate charged on the resulting note would fluctuate with the Corporation's base rate. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Corporation evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Corporation upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counter-party. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.   Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Corporation to guarantee payment or performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Corporation obtains collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.   At December 31, 2011, the Corporation had residential mortgage commitments to extend credit aggregating approximately $339,000 with a variable rate of 3.25% and $7.9 million at fixed rates averaging 4.08%. Approximately $7.1 million of these loan commitments will be sold to investors upon closing. Commercial, construction, and home equity loan commitments of approximately $6.8 million were extended with variable rates averaging 5.29% and $804,000 were extended at fixed rates averaging 6.38%. Generally, commitments were due to expire within approximately 120 days.   The unused lines of credit consist of $14.7 million relating to a home equity line of credit program and an unsecured line of credit program (cash reserve), $4.9 million relating to an unsecured overdraft protection program, and $47.9 million relating to commercial and construction lines of credit. Amounts drawn on the unused lines of credit are predominantly assessed interest at rates which fluctuate with the base rate.   Capital   Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Regulations of the Board of Governors of the FRB require bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital. Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2011, the Corporation was required to maintain (i) a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets of 4.0% and (ii) minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The Bank must comply with substantially similar capital regulations promulgated by the FDIC.     32     Table of Contents      The following table summarizes the capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank at December 31, 2011.               Actual       Required for  Capital  Adequacy  Purposes       To Be Well  Capitalized  Under Prompt  Corrective Action                   Leverage ratio *                                             Corporation         8.86%           4.00%                   N/A           Bank         8.57%           4.00%           5.00%                                                 Risk-based capital                                           Tier I                                             Corporation         12.65%           4.00%                   N/A           Bank         12.22%           4.00%           6.00%                                                   Total                                             Corporation         13.91%           8.00%                   N/A           Bank         13.49%           8.00%           10.00%     * The minimum leverage ratio set by the FRB and the FDIC is 3.00%. Institutions, which are not “top-rated”, will be expected to maintain a ratio of approximately 100 to 200 basis points above this ratio.   On September 1, 2011, in exchange for issuing 15,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the “Series B Preferred Shares”), having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, the Corporation received $15.0 million as part of the Treasury’s SBLF program. The SBLF is a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion.   Using proceeds of the issuance of the Series B Preferred Shares, the Corporation simultaneously repurchased all 10,000 shares of its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, liquidation amount $1,000 per share (the “Series A Preferred Shares”) previously issued under the TARP CPP, for a purchase price of $10,022,222, including accrued but unpaid dividends through the date of repurchase.   The Series B Preferred Shares pay a non-cumulative quarterly dividend in arrears. The Corporation accrues the preferred dividends as earned over the period the Series B Preferred Shares are outstanding. The dividend rate can fluctuate on a quarterly basis during the first ten quarters during which the Series B Preferred Shares are outstanding, based upon changes in the level of “Qualified Small Business Lending” (QSBL - as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement). In general, the dividend rate decreases as the level of the Bank’s QSBL increases. Based upon the Bank’s level of QSBL over a baseline level, the dividend rate for the initial dividend period was 1%. The dividend rate for future dividend periods will be set based upon changes in the level of QSBL as compared to the baseline level. Such dividend rate may vary from 1% to 5% per annum for the second through tenth dividend periods and from 1% to 7% for the eleventh through the first half of the nineteenth dividend periods, to reflect the amount of change in the Bank’s level of QBSL. In the event that the Series B Preferred Shares remain outstanding for more than four and one half years, the dividend rate will be fixed at 9%. Such dividends are not cumulative but the Corporation may only declare and pay dividends on its common stock (or any other equity securities junior to the Series B Preferred Stock) if it has declared and paid dividends on the Series B Preferred Shares for the current dividend period and will be subject to other restrictions on its ability to repurchase or redeem other securities.   Subject to regulatory approval, the Corporation may redeem the Series B Preferred Shares at any time. The Series B Preferred Shares are includable in Tier I capital for regulatory capital.   On October 26, 2011, the Corporation completed the repurchase of the 10-year warrant held by the Treasury which was issued as part of the Corporation's participation in the TARP CPP, and entitled the Treasury to purchase 133,475 shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.24 per share. The Corporation paid a total of $107,398 to the Treasury to repurchase the warrant.         33     Table of Contents        Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK           44     ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   The objective of this section is to help understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition. You should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements that appear under Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.   Overview   Income . Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest and dividend income. Net interest and dividend income is the difference between interest and dividend income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. To a much lesser extent, we also recognize pre-tax income from service charge income – mostly from service charges on deposit accounts, from the increase in cash surrender value of our bank-owned life insurance and from the sale of securities and loans.   Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. We evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a monthly basis. When additional allowances are necessary, a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings.   Expenses. The expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, advertising and promotion expenses, professional fees, data processing expense, FDIC insurance assessment, stationery and supplies expense, amortization of identifiable intangible assets and other miscellaneous expenses.   Salaries and employee benefits expenses consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes and expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits. It also includes expenses related to our employee stock ownership plan and restricted stock awards granted under our stock-based incentive plan. Expense for the employee stock ownership plan is based on the average market value of the shares committed to be released. An equal number of shares are released each year over terms of the two loans from New England Bancshares that were used to fund the employee stock ownership plan’s purchase of shares in the stock offering in both the mutual holding company reorganization and the second-step conversion. Expense for shares of restricted stock awards is based on the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Compensation and related expenses is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. We began expensing stock options in fiscal 2007 and are included in salaries and employee benefits expenses and the consolidated statements of income.   Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of land, building and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, real estate taxes, depreciation charges, furniture and equipment expenses, maintenance and costs of utilities. Depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the related assets, which range from ten to 50 years for buildings and premises and three to 20 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or term of the lease.   Advertising and promotion expenses include expenses for print advertisements, promotions and premium items.   Professional fees primarily include fees paid to our independent auditors, our attorneys, our internal auditor and any consultants we employ, such as to review our loan or investment portfolios.   Data processing expenses include fees paid to our third-party data processing service and ATM expense.       21              FDIC insurance assessment consists of deposit insurance premiums paid to the FDIC.   Stationery and supplies expense consists of expenses for office supplies.   Amortization of identifiable intangible assets consists of the amortization, on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period, of the $886,000 core deposit intangible that was incurred in connection with the acquisition of Windsor Locks Community Bank, FSL in December 2003 and the amortization, on a sum-of-years digits basis over a ten-year period, of the $2.5 million core deposit intangible that was incurred in conjunction with the Company’s acquisition of First Valley Bancorp, Inc. in July 2007.   Other expenses include charitable contributions, regulatory assessments, telephone, insurance and other miscellaneous operating expenses.   Critical Accounting Policies   We consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or income to be critical accounting policies. We consider accounting policies relating to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill and other intangibles to be critical accounting policies.   Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to income. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are: loss exposure at default; the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans; the value of collateral; and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio. All of these estimates are susceptible to significant change.   Management reviews the level of the allowance on a monthly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based on an evaluation of the portfolio, past loss experience, economic conditions and business conditions affecting our primary market area, credit quality trends, collateral value, loan volumes and concentrations, seasoning of the loan portfolio, the duration of the current business cycle, bank regulatory examination results and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation. For example, a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non-performing loans. Additionally, a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized. In either case, this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses, which would negatively impact earnings. Further, the FDIC and State of Connecticut Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination processes, review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination. An increase to the allowance required to be made by an agency would negatively impact our earnings. Additionally, a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would negatively affect earnings. See Notes 2 and 4 to “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report.   Goodwill and Other Intangibles. We record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required by ASU 2010-28. Goodwill is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated methods, and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount. The initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded, and subsequent impairment analysis, requires us to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, customer attrition, changes in revenue grown trends, specific industry conditions and changes in competition.       22              Operating Strategy   Our mission is to operate and further expand a profitable community-oriented financial institution. We plan to achieve this by executing our strategy of:             •     pursuing opportunities to increase commercial real estate lending and commercial loans in our market area;                             •     continuing to emphasize the origination of one- to four-family residential real estate loans;                             •     expanding our delivery system through a combination of increased uses of technology and additional branch facilities, although we have not entered into any agreements regarding the establishment or acquisition of new branches;                             •     aggressively attracting core deposits;                             •     managing our net interest margin and net interest spread by having a greater percentage of our assets in loans, especially higher-yielding loans, which generally have a higher yield than securities; and                             •     managing interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable-rate or shorter duration loans.   Pursue opportunities to increase commercial real estate lending in our market area   Commercial real estate loans provide us with the opportunity to earn more income because they tend to have higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans. In addition, these loans are beneficial for interest rate risk management because they typically have shorter terms and adjustable interest rates. Commercial real estate loans increased $37.3 million and $28.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and at March 31, 2012 comprised approximately 51.9% of total loans. There are many commercial properties located in our market area, and we may pursue the larger lending relationships associated with these opportunities, while continuing to originate any such loans in accordance with what we believe are our conservative underwriting guidelines. We have added expertise in our commercial loan department in recent years. Additionally, we may employ additional commercial lenders in the future to help increase our commercial lending.   However, these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, since such loans generally entail greater risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.   Expand our delivery system through a combination of increased uses of technology and additional branch facilities   We intend to expand the ways in which we reach and serve our customers. We implemented internet banking in fiscal 2003, which allows our customers to access their accounts and pay bills online. In fiscal 2006, we introduced an enhancement to our website to enable customers to obtain loan information to apply for a residential or commercial loan online. Additionally, in fiscal 2008 we introduced remote deposit capture, a product which        23              allows commercial customers to deposit checks from their office with the use of a scanner; thereby eliminating the need to physically visit an office to make a deposit. Also, we opened new branch offices in East Windsor, Connecticut in October 2005, Ellington, Connecticut in April 2006, our Farmington Avenue, Bristol branch office in March 2007 and our Southington branch office in January 2007. In addition, we added four branch offices with our acquisition of Valley Bank in July 2007, and three branch offices in connection with our acquisition of Apple Valley Bank & Trust Company in June 2009. We intend to pursue expansion in our market area in the future, whether through de novo branching or acquisition. However, we have not entered into any binding commitments regarding our expansion plans.   Aggressively attract core deposits   Core deposits (accounts other than certificates of deposit) comprised 50.4% of our total deposits at March 31, 2012. We value core deposits because they represent longer-term customer relationships and a lower cost of funding compared to certificates of deposit. We aggressively seek core deposits through competitive pricing and targeted advertising. In addition, we offer business checking accounts for our commercial customers. We also hope to increase core deposits by pursuing expansion inside and outside of our market area through de novo branching.   Manage net interest margin and net interest spread by having a greater percentage of our assets in loans, especially higher-yielding loans, which generally have a higher yield than securities   We intend to continue to manage our net interest margin and net interest spread by seeking to increase lending levels and by originating higher-yielding loans. Loans secured by multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business loans are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Consequently, multi-family and commercial real estate and commercial business loans typically have higher yields, which increase our net interest margin and net interest spread. In addition, we have started, and expect to continue, to sell one- to four-family mortgage loans in an effort to increase yields on the overall loan portfolio.   Manage interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of adjustable-rate and shorter duration loans   We manage our interest rate sensitivity to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than longer-term loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of our earnings, we have sought to: (1) improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread; and (2) decrease the maturities of our assets, in part by the origination of adjustable-rate and shorter-term loans. To this end, we sell some of our long term fixed rate residential mortgage loans.   Merger Agreement With United Financial Bancorp, Inc. 	   On May 30, 2012, New England Bancshares entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with United Financial Bancorp, Inc. (“United Financial”), the holding company of United Bank, pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into United Financial, with United Financial as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). In addition, the Bank will merge with and into United Bank, with United Bank as the surviving entity.   Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Company common stock issued and outstanding at the time of closing will be converted into the right to receive 0.9575 of a share of United Financial common stock. The merger is currently expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012.   The directors and executive officers of the Company have agreed to vote their shares in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement at the Company stockholders’ meeting to be held to vote on the proposed transaction. David J. O’Connor, current President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and one additional member of the Company’s Board of Directors will join the Board of Directors of United Financial. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company has agreed to pay United Financial a termination fee of $3.2 million.       24              The completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by stockholders of the Company and United Financial. The Company has also agreed not to (i) solicit proposals relating to alternative business combination transactions or (ii) subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning confidential information in connection with, alternative business combination transactions.   The Merger Agreement also contains usual and customary representations and warranties that the Company and United Financial made to each other as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the contract between the Company and United Financial, and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating its terms. Moreover, the representations and warranties are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that may be different from what may be viewed as material to stockholders, and the representations and warranties may have been used to allocate risk between the Company and United Financial rather than establishing matters as facts.   Balance Sheet Analysis   Loans . We originate real estate loans secured by commercial real estate, residential real estate and construction loans, which are secured by residential and commercial real estate. At March 31, 2012, real estate loans totaled $452.4 million, or 81.2% of total loans, compared to $441.8 million, or 83.2%, of total loans at March 31, 2011.   Commercial real estate loans totaled $289.1 million at March 31, 2012, which represented 63.9% of real estate loans and 51.9% of total loans, compared to $251.7 million at March 31, 2011, which represented 57.0% of real estate loans and 47.4% of total loans. Commercial real estate loans increased $37.3 million, or 14.8%, for the year ended March 31, 2012 primarily due to the Company focusing on this type of lending.   One-to-four family residential real estate loans totaled $125.6 million at March 31, 2012, which represented 27.8% of real estate loans and 22.6% of total loans compared to $149.7 million at March 31, 2011, which represented 33.9% of real estate loans and 28.2% of total loans. Residential real estate loans decreased $24.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2012, primarily due to the Company selling originated loans in the secondary market and loan payoffs.   We originate home equity loans and lines of credit secured by residential real estate. This portfolio totaled $37.7 million at March 31, 2012, which represented 6.8% of total loans, compared to $40.4 million at March 31, 2011, which represented 7.6% of total loans.   We also originate commercial business loans secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable, in addition to issuing letters of credit. Commercial business loans totaled $94.7 million at March 31, 2012, which represented 17.0% of total loans, compared to $81.0 million at March 31, 2011, which represented 15.2% of total loans. Commercial business loans increased $13.7 million, or 16.9% for the year ended March 31, 2012 primarily due to the Company focusing on these types of loans.   We originate a variety of consumer loans, including loans secured by mobile homes, automobiles and passbook or certificate accounts. Consumer loans totaled $9.8 million and represented 1.8% of total loans at March 31, 2012, and $8.6 million at March 31, 2011 which represented 1.6% of total loans.       25              The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.               At March 31,               2012         2011         2010         2009         2008                 Amount         Percent Of                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Total           Amount         Percent Of                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Total           Amount         Percent Of                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Total           Amount         Percent Of                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Total           Amount         Percent Of                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Total               (Dollars in thousands)       Mortgage loans:                                                                                                                             1-to-4 family residential       $ 125,636           22.56 %       $ 149,740           28.18 %       $ 174,004           33.47 %       $ 125,613           29.90 %       $ 130,297           34.65 %     Commercial real estate         289,057           51.91           251,743           47.37           223,567           43.00           177,498           42.26           155,152           41.26       Home equity loans and lines         37,724           6.77           40,364           7.60           40,157           7.72           33,515           7.98           32,239           8.57       Total mortgage loans         452,417           81.24           441,847           83.15           437,728           84.19           336,626           80.14           317,688           84.48       Consumer loans         9,772           1.76           8,581           1.61           7,293           1.40           6,491           1.55           6,292           1.67       Commercial loans         94,668           17.00           80,967           15.24           74,918           14.41           76,935           18.31           52,058           13.85        Total loans         556,857           100.00 %         531,395           100.00 %         519,939           100.00 %         420,052           100.00 %         376,038           100.00 %                                                                                                                                   Deferred loan origination fees, net         1,086                       886                       190                       (28 )                     (223 )                 Allowance for loan losses         (5,697 )                     (5,686 )                     (4,625 )                     (6,458 )                     (4,046 )                  Total loans, net       $ 552,246                     $ 526,595                     $ 515,504                     $ 413,566                     $ 371,769                     26              The following table sets forth certain information at March 31, 2012 regarding the dollar amount of principal repayments becoming due during the periods indicated.

Available-for-sale securities increased $2.3 million, or 3.9%, in the year ended March 31, 2012 due to increases in all investment categories, except for municipal securities.

The guaranty covers the quarterly distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of Capital Securities, but only to the extent that the Trust has funds necessary to make these payments.    Capital Securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturing of the Debentures on August 23, 2035 or upon earlier redemption as provided in the Indenture. The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part at the liquidation amount plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date.    The trust and guaranty provide for the binding of any successors in the event of a merger, as is the case in the merger of First Valley Bancorp and the Company. The Company has assumed the obligations of First Valley Bancorp in regards to the Debentures due to the acquisition of First Valley Bancorp by the Company.       31                Results of Operations for the Years Ended March 31, 2012 and 2011   Overview.                2012         2011         % Change               (Dollars in thousands)                                           Net income       $ 4,559         $ 3,154           44.55 %     Return on average assets         0.64 %         0.46 %         39.13       Return on average equity         6.29 %         4.55 %         38.24       Average equity to average assets         10.17 %         10.12 %         0.49     Net income increased due primarily to increases in net interest and dividend income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses and a gain from a legal settlement related to the investment portfolio partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and income tax expense. Net interest and dividend income increased primarily as a result of a higher average balance of interest-earning assets and a decrease in the cost of funds, partially offset by a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets and a higher average balance of interest-bearing liabilities.   Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income totaled $22.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $500,000 or 2.3% compared to the prior fiscal year. This resulted mainly from a $33.8 million increase in average interest-earning assets during the year partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in our interest rate spread to 3.25% and a $13.9 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest margin decreased 9 basis points to 3.48% for fiscal 2012.   Interest and dividend income decreased $614,000, or 2.2%, from $33.4 million for fiscal 2011 to $32.8 million for fiscal 2012. Average interest-earning assets were $660.8 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $33.8 million, or 5.4%, compared to $627.0 million for fiscal 2011. The increase in average interest-earning assets resulted primarily from increases in loans and federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits and marketable equity securities, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased from 5.33% to 4.95% due primarily to a decline in interest rates which affected our loan portfolio, the yield on which decreased 23 basis points.   Interest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 11.3%, from $11.0 million for fiscal 2011 to $9.8 million for fiscal 2012. Average interest-bearing liabilities grew $13.9 million, or 2.5%, from $555.9 million for fiscal 2011 to $569.8 million for fiscal 2012 due primarily to increases in deposits partially offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and subordinated debentures, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 1.71% for fiscal 2012 from 1.98% for fiscal 2011 due to the decline in interest rates on deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.       32              Average Balances and Yields . The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. For purposes of this table, average balances have been calculated using the average of month-end balances and non-accrual loans are included in average balances; however, accrued interest income has been excluded from these loans.               For     the Fiscal Years Ended March 31,               2012         2011         2010               Average

The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to changes in both rate and volume that cannot be segregated have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.               Fiscal Year Ended  March 31, 2012 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2011         Fiscal Year Ended  March 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2010               Increase (Decrease) Due to                   Increase (Decrease) Due to                         Rate         Volume         Net         Volume         Rate         Net               (In thousands)       Interest-earning assets:                                                                             Federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits and marketable equity securities	       $ (4 )       $ 46         $ 42         $ (117 )       $ (55 )       $ (172 )     Investments in     available-for-sale securities, other than mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities	         (209 )         60           (149 )         (134 )         107           (27 )     Mortgage-backed     and mortgage-related securities	         (260 )         (76 )         (336 )         (348 )         (351 )         (699 )     Federal Home Loan Bank stock         21           —           21           —           —           —       Loans, net (1) 	         (1,106 )         915           (191 )         (698 )         2,327           1,629       Total interest-earning assets         (1,558 )         945           613           (1,297 )         2,028           731                                                                                     Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                                             Savings accounts         (58 )         49           (9 )         (117 )         39           (78 )     NOW accounts         (4 )         1           (3 )         (11 )         2           (9 )     Money market accounts         (702 )         655           (47 )         (705 )         345           (360 )     Certificate accounts         (561 )         88           (473 )         (1,337 )         37           (1,300 )     Federal Home Loan Bank advances and subordinated debentures	         (333 )         (334 )         (667 )         (223 )         (623 )         (846 )     Advanced     payments by borrowers for taxes and insurance	         (1 )         2           1           —           —           —       Securities sold under agreements to repurchase         (6 )         (43 )         (49 )         (17 )         88           71       Total interest-bearing liabilities         (1,665 )         418           (1,247 )         (2,410 )         (112 )         (2,522 )     Increase in net interest income       $ 107         $ 527         $ 634         $ 1,113         $ 2,140         $ 3,253           (1)     Amount is net of deferred loan origination costs, undisbursed proceeds of construction loans in process, allowance for loan losses and includes non-accruing loans. We record interest income on non-accruing loans on a cash basis. Loan fees are included in interest income.   Provision for Loan Losses. Provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The size of the provision for each year is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management’s assessment of loan portfolio quality, the value of collateral and general economic factors.   We recorded provisions for loan losses of $1.6 million and $2.0 million in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The provision was relatively stable as the quality of the loan portfolio has remained relatively stable over the last year.   Although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for losses, there can be no assurance that we will not have to change the provisions for loan losses in subsequent periods. Management will continue to monitor the allowance for loan losses and make additional provisions to the allowance as appropriate.       34              An analysis of the changes in the allowance for loan losses, non-performing loans and classified loans is presented under “—Risk Management—Analysis of Non-Performing and Classified Assets” and “—Risk Management—Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Loan Losses.”   Noninterest Income (Charges). The following table shows the components of noninterest (charges) income and the percentage changes from 2012 to 2011.               2012         2011         % Change               (In thousands)                                                     Service charges on deposit accounts       $ 1,407         $ 1,321           6.5 %     Gain on sales and calls of securities, net         276           327           (18.5 )     Gain on sale of loans         280           306           (8.5 )     Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance policies         348           367           (5.2 )     Gain from legal settlement         1,283           —           100.0       Other income         422           205           105.9       Total       $ 4,016         $ 2,526           59.0 %   The $1,490,000 increase in noninterest income was primarily due to the $1,283,000 increase in gain on from legal settlement related to the investment portfolio and a $217,000 increase in other income, partially offset by the $51,000 decrease in gain on sale of securities and the $26,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans.   Noninterest Expense.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 compared to $1.6 million in the previous year.       35            Risk Management   Overview . Managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution. Our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk, interest rate risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is contractually due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Other risks that we encounter are operational risks, liquidity risks and reputation risk. Operational risks include risks related to fraud, regulatory compliance, processing errors, technology and disaster recovery. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations owed to depositors, lenders or borrowers. Reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue.   Credit Risk Management . Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well-defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans.   When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes 15 days past due. If payment is not received by the 30 th day of delinquency, additional letters and phone calls generally are made. Typically, when the loan becomes 60 days past due, we send a letter notifying the borrower that we may commence legal proceedings if the loan is not paid in full within 30 days. Generally, loan workout arrangements are made with the borrower at this time; however, if an arrangement cannot be structured before the loan becomes 90 days past due, we will send a formal demand letter and, once the time period specified in that letter expires, commence legal proceedings against any real property that secures the loan or attempt to repossess any business assets or personal property that secures the loan. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure.   Management informs the Boards of Directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than 30 days, and all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own on a quarterly basis.   Analysis of Non-performing and Classified Assets. We consider repossessed assets and loans that are 90 days or more past due to be non-performing assets. When a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at which time the accrual of interest ceases and an allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations. Typically, payments received on a non-accrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan.   Real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or at fair value. Thereafter, we carry foreclosed real estate at fair value, net of estimated selling costs. Holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income.   Non-performing assets totaled $16.7 million, or 2.29% of total assets, at March 31, 2012, which was an increase of $1.8 million from March 31, 2011. As a result, nonperforming loans as a percentage of loans increased from 2.53% at March 31, 2011 to 2.72% at March 31, 2012. At March 31, 2012 we had four residential properties and three commercial properties classified as other real estate owned totaling $1.5 million. We had five residential properties and three commercial properties classified as other real estate owned with a balance of $1.5 million at March 31, 2011. At March 31, 2012, non-accrual loans consisted of twenty six residential real estate loans, thirty commercial loans, twenty two commercial real estate loans, eight consumer loans and seven home equity loans, compared to twenty-three residential real estate loans, eighteen commercial loans, seventeen commercial real estate loans, eight consumer loans and six home equity loans at March 31, 2011.       36              The following table provides information with respect to our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.               At March 31,               2012         2011         2010         2009         2008               (Dollars in thousands)       Non-accruing loans:                                                                 Mortgage loans:                                                                 Residential loans       $ 3,734         $ 4,429         $ 3,119         $ 1,905         $ 737       Commercial real estate         7,141           5,461           2,664           3,918           —       Home equity loans and lines of credit         170           184           102           439           398       Total mortgage loans         11,045           10,074           5,885           6,262           1,135       Consumer loans         56           165           46           28           22       Commercial loans         4,072           3,203           3,064           5,636           10       Total nonaccrual loans         15,173           13,442           8,995           11,926           1,167       Other real estate owned         1,491           1,496           2,846           141           —       Other repossessed assets         —           —           173           —           —       Total nonperforming assets       $ 16,664         $ 14,938         $ 12,014         $ 12,067         $ 1,167       Performing troubled debt restructurings         3,000           —           —           —           —                                                                         Total nonperforming assets and     performing troubled debt restructurings       $ 19,664         $ 14,938         $ 12,014         $ 12,067         $ 1,167       Impaired loans       $ 15,311         $ 15,339         $ 7,978         $ 10,135         $ 398       Accruing loans 90 days or more past due         —           214           —           15           8       Allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans (1) 	         1.02 %         1.07 %         0.89 %         1.54 %         1.08 %     Allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans (2) 	         37.55 %         42.30 %         51.42 %         54.15 %         346.70 %     Nonperforming loans as a percent of loans (1)(2) 	         2.72 %         2.53 %         1.73 %         2.84 %         0.31 %     Nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets         2.29 %         2.19 %         1.78 %         2.11 %         0.23 %         (1)     Loans are presented before allowance for loan losses.

At March 31, 2012, we had total troubled debt restructurings of $5.0 million. At March 31, 2012, $3.0 million of our troubled debt restructurings were accruing and performing in accordance with their modified terms.   For the year ended March 31, 2012, gross interest income that would have been recorded had our troubled debt restructurings been current in accordance with their original terms was $278,000. Interest income recognized on such loans for the year ended March 31, 2012 was $232,000.   Banking regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis. In addition, the Connecticut Department of Banking and FDIC have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. There are three classifications for problem assets: substandard, doubtful and loss. “Substandard assets” must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. “Doubtful assets” have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values questionable and there is a high possibility of loss. An asset classified “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. The regulations also provide for a “special mention” category, described as assets that do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. When we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful, we establish a specific allowance for loan losses. If we classify an asset as loss, we charge off an amount equal to 100% of the portion of the asset classified as loss.       37              Classified Assets. The following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified and criticized assets at the dates indicated.               At March 31,               2012         2011               (In thousands)       Special mention assets       $ 9,252         $ 11,420       Substandard assets         25,983           26,693       Doubtful assets         —           —       Loss assets         —           —       Total classified and criticized assets       $ 35,235         $ 38,113       Classified assets at March 31, 2012 included ninety three loans totaling $18.5 million that were considered non-performing. Classified assets at March 31, 2011 included seventy two loans totaling $13.4 million that were considered non-performing.   Classified and special mention assets decreased $2.9 million to $35.2 million at March 31, 2012, from $38.1 million at March 31, 2011, and were 6.3% and 7.2% of total loans at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The decrease was caused primarily by the reduction of loans in the special mention category.   Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing and are not included in non-accrual loans above, but may be delinquent. These loans require an increased level of management attention, because we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and as a result such loans may be included at a later date in non-accrual loans. At March 31, 2012, we had no potential problem loans that are not discussed above under “—Classified Assets.”     Delinquencies. The following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.               At     March 31, 2012         At     March 31, 2011         At     March 31,

We maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing portfolio. When a loan, or portion thereof, is considered uncollectible, it is charged against the allowance. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are added to the allowance when collected. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management. Based on management’s judgment, the allowance for loan losses covers all known losses and inherent losses in the loan portfolio.   Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of specific allowances for identified problem loans and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio. Although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately, the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio.   Specific Allowances for Identified Problem Loans. We establish an allowance on identified problem loans based on factors including, but not limited to: (1) the borrower’s ability and willingness to repay the loan; (2) the type, marketability, and value of the collateral; (3) the strength of our collateral position; and (4) the borrower’s repayment history.       38              General Valuation Allowance on the Remainder of the Portfolio. We also establish a general allowance by applying loss factors to the remainder of the loan portfolio to capture the inherent losses associated with the lending activity. This general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning loss factors to each category. The loss factors are determined based on our historical loss experience, delinquency trends and management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio. Based on management’s judgment, we may adjust the loss factors due to: (1) changes in lending policies and procedures; (2) changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary market area; (3) credit quality trends; (4) collateral value; (5) loan volumes and concentrations; (6) seasoning of the loan portfolio; (7) recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio; (8) duration of the current business cycle; and (9) bank regulatory examination results. Loss factors are reevaluated quarterly to ensure their relevance in the current real estate environment.   The Connecticut Department of Banking, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. They may require the Bank to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.   At March 31, 2012, our allowance for loan losses represented 1.02% of total loans and 37.55% of non-performing loans. The allowance for loan losses increased $11,000 from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012 due to a provision for loan losses of $1.6 million, partially offset by net charge-offs of $1.6 million. The provision for loan losses for the year ended March 31, 2012 reflected the deterioration in the local economy as well as continued growth of the loan portfolio, particularly the increase in commercial real estate and commercial loans, which carry higher risks of default than one- to four-family residential real estate loans.   The following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at the dates indicated.               At March 31,               2012         2011         2010         2009         2008               Amount         Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans         Amount         Percent of Loans in Each Category to Total Loans               (Dollars in thousands)       Mortgage loans:                                                                                                                             Residential loans       $ 789           22.56 %       $ 738           28.18 %       $ 566           33.47 %       $ 545           29.90 %       $ 531           34.65 %     Commercial real estate         2,794           51.91           1,981           47.37           1,824           43.00           1,981           42.26           2,202           41.26       Home equity loans and lines of credit         127           6.78           154           7.60           177           7.72           296           7.98           287           8.57       Consumer loans         64           1.75           98           1.61           39           1.40           68           1.55           54           1.67       Commercial loans         1,923           17.00           2,715           15.24           2,019           14.41           3,568           18.31           972           13.85       Total allowance for loan losses       $ 5,697           100.00 %       $ 5,686           100.00 %       $ 4,625           100.00 %       $ 6,458           100.00 %       $ 4,046           100.00 %   Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loan deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.       39              Analysis of Loan Loss Experience. The following table sets forth an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated. Where specific loan loss allowances have been established, any difference between the loss allowance and the amount of loss realized has been charged or credited to current income.               At or For the Fiscal Year  Ended March 31,               2012         2011         2010         2009         2008               (Dollars in thousands)                                                               Balance at beginning of period       $ 5,686         $ 4,625         $ 6,458         $ 4,046         $ 1,875       Provision for loan losses         1,600           2,013           3,049           2,929           307       Charge-offs:                                                                 Residential loans         379           145           202           127           24       Commercial real estate loans         313           29           540           —           58       Home equity loans and lines of credit         17           —           14           —           —       Consumer loans         42           65           27           36           34       Commercial loans         974           771           4,160           354           15       Total charge-offs         1,725           1,010           4,943           517           131       Recoveries:                                                                 Residential loans         58           9           3           —           —       Consumer loans         22           7           24           —           3       Commercial loans         56           42           34           —           11       Total Recoveries         136           58           61           —           14       Net charge-offs         1,589           952           4,882           517           117       Allowance obtained through merger         —           —           —           —           1,981       Balance at end of period       $ 5,697         $ 5,686         $ 4,625         $ 6,458         $ 4,046       Ratio of net charge-offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period	         0.29 %         0.18 %         0.94 %         0.12 %         0.03 %     Allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans (1) 	         1.02 %         1.07 %         0.89 %         1.54 %         1.08 %     Allowance for loan losses as a percent of                                                                                                                   nonperforming loans (2) 	         37.55 %         42.30 %         51.42 %         54.15 %         346.70 %         (1)     Loans are presented before allowance for loan losses.     (2)     Non-performing loans consist of all loans 90 days or more past due and other loans which we have identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectibility of interest or principal.   During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, we acquired $2.0 million of allowance for loan losses in connection with the acquisition of First Valley Bancorp. The loans acquired in the merger were primarily commercial real estate loans, residential loans and commercial loans, which had a face value of $141.1 million and a fair value of $141.0 million. In determining the fair value of the loans, we used a discounted cash flow method utilizing the current loan rate as of the date of the consummation of the merger. The amount of the allowance for loan losses that was attributable to these loans was calculated based on the collectibility of the loans, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions.   During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 we acquired Apple Valley’s $60.2 million in net loans. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 141(R), the allowance for loan losses of Apple Valley was not consolidated into New England Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Instead, individual loan book values were reduced by the estimated credit loss associated with the allowance for loan losses.    Liquidity Management. Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition.   We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of (1) expected loan demand, (2) expected deposit flows, (3) yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities and (4) the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in money market mutual funds, federal funds sold and short- and intermediate-term agency and municipal securities.       40              Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At March 31, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $62.1 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity, totaled $61.6 million at March 31, 2012. In addition, at March 31, 2012 we had $33.0 million in outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, and the ability to borrow an additional $30.8 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, subject to collateral requirements.   At March 31, 2012, we had $78.6 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $12.6 million in undisbursed construction loans and $37.9 million in unused lines of credit. Certificates of deposit due within one year of March 31, 2012 totaled $140.1 million, or 24.1% of total deposits. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and lines of credit. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before March 31, 2013. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.   The following table presents our contractual obligations at March 31, 2012.               Payments Due by Period               Total         One Year or Less         More than One Year to Three Years         More than Three Years to Five Years         More than Five Years               (In thousands)                                                               Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) 	       $ 37,181         $ 3,835         $ 14,016         $ 13,302         $ 6,028       Operating Lease Obligations         12,393           990           1,901           1,861           7,641       Total       $ 49,574         $ 4,825         $ 15,917         $ 15,163         $ 13,669   __________________     (1)     Consists of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, subordinated debentures and excludes fair value adjustment.   Our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of loans and the purchase of securities. Our primary financing activities consist of activity in deposit accounts, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors. We generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposits and commercial banking relationships. Occasionally, we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract certain deposit products.   The following table presents our primary investing and financing activities during the periods indicated.               Years Ended March 31,               2012         2011         2010                   (In thousands)             Investing activities:                                         Loan originations       $ 114,290         $ 56,938         $ 73,608       Loan participations purchased         —           10,555           51,236       Securities purchased         46,067           42,308           39,753                                                 Financing activities:                                         Increase in deposits       $ 40,499         $ 23,197         $ 98,136       (Decrease) increase in FHLB advances         (6,069 )         (17,747 )         (9,973 )     (Decrease) increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase         6,086           (1,794 )         11,391     Capital Management. The Bank manages its capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and is subject to various regulatory capital requirements. The risk-based capital guidelines for the Bank include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. The Company is also subject to capital requirements on a consolidated basis. At March 31, 2012, the Company and the Bank exceeded all of their regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is considered “well capitalized” under regulatory guidelines. See “Item 1. Description of Business” and Note 15 of “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.”       41              Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers’ requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. A presentation of our outstanding loan commitments and unused lines of credit at March 31, 2012 and their effect on our liquidity is presented at Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report and under “—Risk Management—Liquidity Management.”   For the year ended March 31, 2012, we did not engage in any off-balance-sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, “Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses.” This ASU is created to provide financial statement users with greater transparency about an entity’s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables. This ASU is intended to provide additional information to assist financial statement users in assessing the entity’s credit risk exposures and evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses. The amendments in this ASU are effective as of the end of a reporting period for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010. The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The required disclosures are included in Note 4 to the Company’s Financial Statements.   In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.” This ASU addresses when to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation or financial position.   In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29, “Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations.” This ASU addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations. This ASU is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operation or financial position.   In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, “A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring.” This ASU provides additional guidance or clarification to help creditors determine whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring. For public entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011, and should be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption. As a result of applying these amendments, an entity may identify receivables that are newly considered impaired, and should measure impairment on those receivables prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June 15, 2011. Additional disclosures are also required under this ASU. The required disclosures are included in Note 4 to the Company’s Financial Statements.   In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.” The amendments in this ASU explain how to measure fair value. They do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.       42              In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, “Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” The objective of this ASU is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Under this ASU, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. An entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. An entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. The amendments in this ASU should be applied retrospectively. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other”, an update to ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.” ASU 2011-08 simplifies how entities, both public and nonpublic, test goodwill for impairment. The amendments in this update permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC 350. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. For public and nonpublic entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.   In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-09, “Disclosures About an Employer’s Participation in a Multiemployer Plan,” which amends ASC 715-80, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits - Multiemployer Plans,” and requires additional separate disclosures for multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefit plans. This objective of this ASU is to help users of financial statements assess the potential future cash flow implications relating to an employer’s participation in multiemployer pension plans. The disclosures also will indicate the financial health of all of the significant plans in which the employer participates and assist a financial statement user to access additional information that is available outside the financial statements. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, “Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.” This ASU is to enhance current disclosures. Entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, “Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.” The amendments in this update defer those changes in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented. All other requirements in ASU 2011-05 are not affected by this update. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.     Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices   The financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.       43                  ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   Interest Rate Risk Management. The Bank manages the interest rate sensitivity of its interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment. Deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits. As a result, sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect the Bank’s earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect their earnings. To reduce the potential volatility of their earnings, the Bank has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates, while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread. Also, the Bank attempts to manage its interest rate risk through: its investment portfolio, an increased focus on commercial and multi-family and commercial real estate lending, which emphasizes the origination of shorter-term adjustable-rate loans; and efforts to originate adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans. In addition, the Bank has commenced a program of selling long term, fixed-rate one- to four-family residential loans in the secondary market. The Bank currently does not participate in hedging programs, interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments.   The Bank has an Asset/Liability Committee, which includes members of both the board of directors and management, to communicate, coordinate and control all aspects involving asset/liability management. The committee establishes and monitors the volume, maturities, pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity, growth, risk limits and profitability goals.   Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis. The Bank analyzes its interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income simulation. The matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are “interest sensitive.” An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period.   The Bank’s goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income. Interest income simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the Asset/Liability Committee. The simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under a range of assumptions. The numerous assumptions used in the simulation processes are reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee on a quarterly basis. Changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation. The simulations incorporate assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates. The simulation analyses incorporate management’s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors.   The simulation analyses are only an estimate of the Bank’s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time. The Bank’s board of directors and management continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities.       44              		</c>

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     21     Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Statements contained in this report, which are not historical facts, may be considered forward-looking information with respect to plans, projections, or future performance of the Company as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The words “anticipate,” “believe”, “estimate”, “expect,” “objective,” and “think” or similar expressions used herein are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company’s current views and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that include, among other things, the effects of the Company’s business, actions of competitors, changes in laws and regulations, including accounting standards, employee relations, customer demand, prices of purchased raw material and parts, domestic economic conditions, including housing starts and changes in consumer disposable income, and foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations. Some or all of the facts are beyond the Company’s control.   The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this report, which provide additional information concerning the Company’s financial activities and condition.   Overview   The Company designs, develops and manufactures printed circuit connectors for high performance applications. We have also developed a high performance plastic circular connector line. All of our products utilize the HYPERTAC™ contact design, which is identified by the generic “HYPERBOLOID” in our catalogs. This is necessary since all other HYPERTAC™ companies have been purchased by a multi-national company. We are the only independent producer of HYPERTAC™ in the United States.   Our customers consist of OEM’s (Original Equipment Manufacturers), companies manufacturing medical equipment, and Distributors who resell our products to OEMs. We sell our products directly and through 16 independent sales representatives located in all regions of the United States as well as in, Canada, Israel, India, various Pacific Rim countries, South Korea and the European Union (EU).   The customers we service are in the Government, Military, Aerospace, Medical, Automotive, Industrial, Test Equipment and Commercial Electronics markets. We appear on the Military Qualified Product Listing “QPL” to MIL-DTL-55302 and supply customer requested modifications to this specification. Sales to the commercial electronic and military markets were 31% and 60%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales for the year ended March 30, 2012. Our offering of “QPL” items has recently been expanded to include additional products.   Critical Accounting Policies   The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies, which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management.   · Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is     - 13 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II            Item 7.      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   Critical Accounting Policies (continued)   recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company makes estimates of its future cash flows related to assets subject to impairment review.             ·     Inventory Valuation: Raw materials and supplies are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. Finished goods and work in process are valued at the lower of actual cost, determined on a specific identification basis, or market. The Company estimates which materials may be obsolete and which products in work in process or finished goods may be sold at less than cost, and adjusts their inventory value accordingly. Future periods could include either income or expense items if estimates change and for differences between the estimated and actual amount realized from the sale of inventory.             ·     Income Taxes: The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. Income tax expense in future periods could be adjusted for the difference between actual payments and the Company's recorded liability based on its assessments and estimates.             ·     Revenue Recognition: Revenues are recognized at the shipping date of the Company's products. The Company has historically adopted the shipping terms that title merchandise passes to the customer at the shipping point (FOB Shipping Point). At this juncture, title has passed, the Company has recognized the sale, inventory has been relieved, and the customer has been invoiced. The Company does not offer any discounts, credits or other sales incentives.   The Company’s policy with respect to customer returns and allowances as well as product warranty is as follows:   The Company will accept a return of a defective product within one year from shipment for repair or replacement at the Company’s option. If the product is repairable, the Company at its own cost will repair and return it to the customer. If not repairable, the Company will either offer an allowance against payment or will reimburse the customer for the total cost of the product deemed defective.   Most of the Company’s products are custom ordered by customers for a specific use. The Company provides engineering services as part of the relationship with its customers in developing the custom product. The Company is not obligated to provide such engineering service to its customers. The Company does not charge separately for these services.             ·     Research & Development: The Company provides personalized engineering services to its customers by designing connectors for specific customer applications. The employment of electromechanical engineers is the anticipated cornerstone of the Company’s future growth. The Company maintains a testing laboratory where its         - 14 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II          Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   Critical Accounting Policies (continued)   engineers experiment with new connector designs based on changes in technology and in an attempt to create innovative, more efficient connector designs.   The Company did not expend any funds on, nor receive any revenues related to, customer sponsored research and development activities relating to the development of new designs, techniques and the improvement of existing designs during the years ended March 30, 2012 and March 25, 2011, respectively.   Results of Operations   The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, percentages for certain items reflected in the financial data as such items bear to the revenues of the Company:       Relationship to Total Revenues             March 30,         March 25,               2012         2011                                 Operating revenues (in thousands)       $ 13,293         $ 13,824                                     Operating expenses:                              (as a percentage of operating revenues)                                                                     Costs of products sold         66.1 %         62.9 %                Selling, general and administrative         15.9 %         14.4 %                Interest expense         .3 %         .3 %                Depreciation and amortization         1.4 %         1.2 %                                                     TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES         83.7 %         78.8 %                                   Operating income         16.3 %         21.2 %                                   Other income         —           —                                     Income before income taxes         16.3 %         21.2 %                                   Income taxes         (8.0 %)         (9.2 %)                                   Net income         8.3 %         12.0 %         - 15 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II            Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   Results of Operations (continued)   Year End Results: March 30, 2012 vs. March 25, 2011 (continued)   Net sales for the year ended March 30, 2012 amounted to $13,292,732 reflecting a 3.8% decrease versus the year ended March 25, 2011 net sales of $13,823,640. The decrease in net sales is a direct result of a slow economy.   The Company is primarily a manufacturer and its products are essentially basic components of larger assemblies of                                                         finished goods. Approximately 96% of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years ended March 30, 2012 and March 25,                                                         2011, respectively, were made directly to manufacturers of finished products with the balance of the Company’s products                                                         sold to distributors.   	 Distributors often purchase connectors for customers who do not require large quantities of connectors over a short period of time but rather require small allotments of connectors over an extended period of time. 	   For the fiscal year ended March 30, 2012, five of the Company’s customers accounted for approximately 50.3% of net sales. Of these, two customers accounted for approximately 24% of net sales. Four of the Company’s customers accounted for 38% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended March 25, 2011. One of those customers accounted for 14% of the Company’s net sales.   The Company currently employs 16 independent sales representatives to market its products in all regions of the United States as well as in Canada, Israel, India, various Pacific Rim countries, South Korea and the European Union (EU). These sales representatives accounted for approximately 94% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended March 30, 2012, with the balance of net sales being generated by direct customer contact.   For the fiscal year ended March 30, 2012, the Company’s principal customers included manufacturers of commercial electronic products, military defense contractors and distributors who service these markets. Sales to the commercial electronic and government markets comprised 91% of the Company’s net sales for the years ended March 30, 2012 and March 25, 2011, respectively. Approximately 9% of net sales were made to international customers for the years ended March 30, 2012 and March 25, 2011, respectively.   Cost of products sold amounted to $8,782,313 for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2012, or 66.1% of operating revenues. This reflected an $88,841 or 1.0% increase in the cost of products sold of $8,693,472 or 62.9% of operating revenues for the fiscal year ended March 25, 2011. This increase is due primarily to the increased cost of production associated with the increase in purchase costs of gold and other components.   Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,118,631 and $1,983,862 or 15.9% and 14.4% of net sales for the fiscal years ended March 30, 2012 and March 25, 2011, respectively. This category of expenses increased by $134,769 or 6.8% from the prior year. The increase can be attributed to an increase in salaries, commissions and travel.   Interest expense was $39,021 for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2012 or .3% of net sales. For the fiscal year ended March 25, 2011, interest expense was $43,946 or .3% of net sales. The decrease of $4,925 or 11.2% reflects the slight decrease in interest bearing debt by the Company.       - 16 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II              Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   Results of Operations (continued)   Year End Results: March 30, 2012 vs. March 25, 2011 (continued)   Depreciation and amortization of $185,243 or 1.4% of net sales was reported for the fiscal year ended March 30, 2012.                                                        This reflects an increase of $24,061 or 14.9% from the prior year ended March 25, 2011 of $161,182 or 1.2% of net sales. The                                                        increase is due primarily to additional new equipment being put in use during the current fiscal year.   The Company reported net income of $1,102,424 for the year ended March 30, 2012 representing basic earnings of $.48 per                                                        share as compared to net income of $1,669,517 or $ .73 per share for the year ended March 25, 2011.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued)   Results of Operations (continued)   Year End Results: March 30, 2012 vs. March 25, 2011 (continued)   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company reported working capital of $6,286,025 as of March 30, 2012 compared to a working capital of $5,411,126 as of March 25, 2011. The increase in working capital of $874,899 was attributable to the following items:       Net income       $ 1,102,424       Depreciation and amortization         185,243       Capital expenditures         (361,840 )     Other transactions         (50,928 )             $ 874,899     As a result of the above, the current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 8.73 to 1 at March 30, 2012 as compared to 8.01 to 1 at March 25, 2011. Current liabilities at March 30, 2012 were $813,040 compared to $772,080 at March 25, 2011.   The Company reported $361,840 in capital expenditures for the year ended March 30, 2012 and recorded depreciation expense of $185,243 for the year ended March 30, 2012.   The net income of $1,102,424 for the year ended March 30, 2012 resulted in an increase in stockholders’ equity to $7,697,266 as compared to stockholders’ equity of $6,594,842 at March 25, 2011.   The Company has an accounts receivable financing agreement with a non-bank lending institution (“Factor”) whereby it can borrow up to 80 percent of its eligible receivables (as defined in such financing agreement) at an interest rate of 2 ½% above JP Morgan Chase’s publicly announced rate with a minimum interest rate of 12% per annum.   The financing agreement has an initial term of one year and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company or its lender upon receiving 60 days prior notice. Funds advanced by the Factor are secured by the Company’s accounts receivable and inventories. As of March 30, 2012 the Company had reported a liability to the factor of $54,943 as compared to March 25, 2011, where the Company had reported excess payments to the Factor resulting from an overpayment of $78,898, which the Company intended to apply against future borrowings. These excess repayments are reported in the accompanying financial statements as “Excess payments to accounts receivable factor”.   In the past two fiscal years, management has been reviewing its collection practices and policies for outstanding receivables and has revised its collection procedures to a more aggressive collection policy. As a consequence of this new policy the Company’s experience is that its customers have been remitting payments on a more consistent and timely basis. The Company reviews the collectability of all accounts receivable on a monthly basis. The reserve is less than 2% of average gross accounts receivable and is considered to be conservatively adequate.         - 18 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II            Item 7.

Contributions are made in accordance with a negotiated labor contract and are based on the number of covered employees employed per month.   	With the passage of the 1990 Act the Company may become subject to liabilities in excess of contributions made under the collective bargaining agreement. Generally, these liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or partial withdrawal from the Multi-Employer Plan. The Company has not taken any action to terminate, withdraw or partially withdraw from the Multi-Employer Plan nor does it intend to do so in the future. Under the 1990 Act, liabilities would be based upon the Company’s proportional share of such Plan’s unfunded vested benefits, which is currently not available. The amount of accumulated benefits and net assets of such Plan also is not currently available to the Company. The total contributions charged to operations under such Plan were $115,637 for the year ended March 30, 2012 and $110,881 for the year ended March 25, 2011. 	   On September 15, 2008, the Company was notified by the State of New York Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) that the Trade Industry Workers’ Compensation Trust for Manufacturers (the “Trust”) had defaulted. As a member of this self-insured group, the Company was assessed on an estimated basis by the Board for its allocable share necessary to discharge all liabilities of the Trust.   The assessed amount for the years 2002 through 2006 was $101,362. The assessed amount for each year is detailed as follows:       2002       $ 16,826       2003         24,934       2004         31,785       2005         14,748       2006         13,069               $ 101,362     The Company did have the option of paying this assessment as a lump sum amount or paying off the assessment over a 60 month period. The Company elected the deferral option, and was obligated to making monthly payments of $1,689 for 59 months, and $1,711 for the 60 th and final month. The Company had recorded this assessment as a charge to Cost of Sales in the quarter ended December 26, 2008.   The Company was subsequently notified that it was being assessed an additional $146,073 covering the years 2002 through 2007, bringing the total deficit allocation assessment to $247,435.         - 19 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II            Item 7.

The monthly payments, inclusive of interest at 7.50%, are $3,970.   As of March 30, 2012 the remaining balance of the revised assessment payable was $113,061.   On August 31, 2011, the Company’s shareholders approved the adoption of the Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (“2011 Plan”) to provide for the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards to purchase up to 750,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to all employees, consultants and other eligible participants including senior management and members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The 2011 Plan replaced the prior 2002 Employee Stock Option Plan which had expired in accordance with its terms.   Options granted to employees under the 2011 Plan may be designated as options which qualify for incentive stock option treatment under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code, or options which do not qualify (non-qualified stock options).   Under the 2011 Plan, the exercise price of an option designated as an incentive stock option shall not be less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the day the option is granted. In the event an option designated as an incentive stock option is granted to a ten percent (10%) or greater shareholder, such exercise price shall be at least 110 percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock and the option must not be exercisable after the expiration of five years from the day of the grant. The 2011 Plan also provides that holders of options that wish to pay for the exercise price of their options with shares of the Company’s common stock must have beneficially owned such stock for at least six months prior to the exercise date.       - 20 -     Index IEH CORPORATION   PART II            Item 7.

As of March 30, 2012, no options or restricted stock awards had been granted under the 2011 Plan. 	 	 Effects of Inflation   The Company does not view the effects of inflation to have a material effect upon its business. Increases in costs of raw materials and labor costs have been offset by increases in the price of the Company’s products, as well as reductions in costs of production, reflecting management’s efforts in this area. While the Company has in the past increased its prices to customers, it has maintained its relatively competitive price position. However, significant decreases in government and military subcontractor spending have provided excess production capacity in the industry, which in turn has tightened pricing margins.   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements   The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of Item 303 of Regulation S-B.       Item 7A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Business Outlook   Management expects revenues in fiscal 2013 to increase over fiscal year 2012. Expectations are for product mix and margins to remain favorable for fiscal year 2013. During fiscal 2012 new orders received by the Company were approximately $44.4 million. The order backlog of approximately $ 50.8 million at June 30, 2012 gives the Company a solid base of future sales. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $30 million of orders comprising the June 30, 2012 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. The minimum of $30 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. See discussions below for further detail on the customer mix included in the backlog.   In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of $32 million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs. The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally.   Two significant customers represented 60% and 62% of the Company's total sales in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. These sales are in connection with multiyear programs in which the Company is a significant subcontractor. The June 30, 2012 backlog of $50.8 million includes orders from two customers that represent 52% and 10% of the total backlog. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. For several years, management has pursued opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales, mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program and minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer. Management continues to evaluate its business development functions and potential revised courses of action in order to diversify its customer base. The Company currently has a very high concentration level with two customers and this presents significant risk.   Management, along with the Board of Directors, continues to evaluate the need and use of the Company’s working capital. Capital expenditures are expected to be app roximately $200,000 for fiscal 2013. Expectations are that the working capital will be required to fund orders, dividend payments, and general operations of the business. From time to time, management along with the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee of the Board of Directors examine opportunities involving acquisitions or other strategic options, including buying certain products or product lines. The criteria for consideration are synergies with the Company’s existing product base and accretion to earnings.     7              Results of Operations   Net Sales for fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, were $32,037,357 and $29,499,504, respectively, an 8.6% increase. This increase can be attributed to the contract specific nature of the Company’s business and the timing of deliveries on these contracts . More specifically, shipments of power supplies increased by approximately $1.4 million while transformers increased by approximately $1.9 million.   For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 gross profits were $8,820,163 and $ 8,206,199, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent at 27.5% and 27.8%, for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher as compared to products that are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The increased gross profit in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of increased sales volume.   Employment of full time equivalents at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 was 165 people.   Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,828,409 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, a decrease of $ 77,507, or 2.7% as compared to the prior year. The decrease for fiscal 2012 relates primarily to a decrease in salary expense as well as relocation and transportation cost decreases.   Other income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $89,702 and $81,259, respectively. The increase is attributable higher sales of left over scrap metal.   The effective income tax rate was 27.8% in fiscal 2012 and 28.3% in fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the benefit derived from the dividends paid on allocated ESOP shares.   Net income for fiscal 2012, was $4,390,268 or $2.02 and $1.99 per share, basic and diluted, respectively, compared to net income of $3,857,537 or $1.79 and $1.77 per share, basic and diluted, respectively, for fiscal 2011. The increase in net income per share was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross profit on sales, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   The Company's working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments. The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years.   The Company's working capital as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $27,199,385 and $26,124,431, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company repurchased 6,269 and 23,342 shares, respectively, of its common stock for a total purchase price of $143,731 and $575,246, respectively. All shares were purchased from the Company's ESOP. Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of June 30, 2012, management is authorized to purchase an additional $1,856,268 million of Company stock.   The table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal year indicated:               2012         2011       Net cash provided by operating activities       $ 7,386,326         $ 4,913,449       Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities         (1,463,276 )         4,515,760       Net cash used in financing activities         (4,095,437 )         (4,208,464 )       8              Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in net income, the timing of the collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory, level of sales and payments of accounts payable. Net cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and a decrease in proceeds from maturity of investment securities. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock.   The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future.   Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal.   During fiscal year 2012 and fiscal 2011, the Company expended $267,983 and $607,311, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $200,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal 2013. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   Our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the financial statements. We believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts.   Revenue Recognition and Estimates   A significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts. Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion.   Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of overhead costs. The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above, it is possible that materially different amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used, based on changes in circumstances, in the estimation process. When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined, changes are reflected in current period earnings.       9            		</c>

		<id>sample-data/0000914317-12-001335.txt</id>			<c>    Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . General The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which appear in Item 8 of this Report. Overview Revenues for fiscal 2012 increased by 5.3% over fiscal 2011, however, net earnings decreased by 15.3%. The decrease in earnings for the year is attributed to increased expenses needed to reorganize the Company’s license operations in Mexico and full year expenses for an expanded sales staff. The Company believes that these investments in staff will strengthen the Company and provide greater returns during fiscal 2013. Gross profit margins decreased slightly mostly due to product mix. Foreign sales increased by 3.8%. Markets have begun to stabilize and new orders are trending higher. As a result, the Company expects to begin fiscal 2013 with an increased backlog. Inventories at June 30, 2012 were 3.5% higher than at year end fiscal 2011, which were needed to support the higher incoming sales rate. Cash decreased by $379,080 to $6,527,940 mostly due to the $.05 per share special dividend (an aggregate of $351,687) paid in December 2011. Prospects for fiscal 2013 appear favorable as the economy continues to improve and credit is becoming more available.  In August 2012, the Company received a number of large contracts on which the Company had submitted favorable bids. These contracts, which are scheduled to be shipped in fiscal 2013, have substantially increased the Company's subsequent backlog. With a strong financial position and an experienced and reorganized sales staff, the Company is hopeful it will improve its performance in fiscal 2013.  Liquidity and Capital Resources For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, cash decreased by $379,080 compared to an increase of $845,642 during fiscal 2011. The following table summarizes the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows:             Years Ended June 30,       Net cash provided (used) by:       2012         2011       Operating activities       $ 38,053         $ 868,997       Investing activities       $ (65,446 )       $ (23,355 )     Financing activities       $ (351,687 )       $ —   For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, operating activities provided cash of $38,053 compared to $868,997 of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was primarily provided by the Company’s net earnings of $511,689 and non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of $49,924, bad debt expenses of $26,269 and a benefit of $25,752 in deferred income taxes. Additional cash was provided by a decrease in leases and mortgages receivables of $31,313 and deferred income of $20,000. These increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts and trade notes receivables of $199,551 as shipments were heavy during the last month of fiscal 2012 and payments were not yet due. Cash of $81,059 was used to increase inventories to support new orders. In addition a decrease of $98,683 in accounts payable and accrued expenses represents early payments to vendors so that discounts could be realized. Cash was also used to decrease accrued employee expenses by $56,748. Income taxes payable and refundable income taxes used cash of $66,247. Customer deposits decreased by $99,928 due to shipments made in the third quarter from the Company’s backlog while newer orders did not require deposits due to their smaller size. Other assets used cash of $25,197 in the normal course of business.     9     Table of Contents      Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily provided by the Company’s net earnings of $603,773 and by an increase of $389,728 in customer deposits. The increase in customer deposits resulted from increased orders which trended higher than sales during the period. Cash was also provided by non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of $55,872, bad debts of $10,511 and a benefit of $36,382 in deferred income taxes. Other changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash were increases in income taxes payable of $41,451 and accrued employee expenses of $22,007 and decreases in leases and mortgages receivable of $10,913 and other current assets of $11,161. The primary use of cash in fiscal 2011 was an increase in inventories of $416,857, partially offset by a $208,008 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing unpaid invoices not yet due to support the increase in inventories. Other uses of cash consisted of a $52,964 increase in accounts and trade notes receivable and a reduction of $50,988 in inventory reserves. This reserve was placed against returned inventory in prior years which the Company resold during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Investing activities used cash of $65,446 and $23,355 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, mostly for capital expenditures. Financing activities used cash of $351,687 in fiscal 2012 to pay dividends. There were no expenditures in financing activities during fiscal 2011. The Company’s original $2,250,000 revolving line of credit facility expired on October 31, 2011. Due to a change in ownership at the Company’s former lender as a result of the acquisition of the former lender by a new lender, a new line of credit facility was entered into on November 16, 2011. The new credit facility provides a revolving line of credit that entitles the Company to borrow, from time to time, up to $2,250,000, including a $1,000,000 standby letter of credit sub-facility for the purchase of inventory and a $250,000 foreign exchange contract sub-facility. The Company’s obligations under the new facility are guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ assets. No amounts were outstanding under either facility at June 30, 2012 and 2011, nor were there any amounts outstanding at any time during fiscal 2012 or 2011. The new facility requires maintenance of certain debt service coverage and leverage ratios and contained other restrictive covenants, including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, guarantee indebtedness of others, grant liens, sell assets and make investments. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at June 30, 2012 and 2011. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, net cash from operations and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and to meet its long term liquidity needs. Off-Balance Sheet Financing The Company has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. Results of Operations             Year Ended June 30,                         2012         2011                 Net sales       $ 22,075,970         $ 20,963,876           +5.3%       Development fees, franchise and license  fees, commissions and other         381,119           361,851           +5.3%       Total revenues       $ 22,457,089         $ 21,325,727           +5.3%     Net sales for the year ended June 30, 2012 increased by $1,112,094 (5.3%) over fiscal 2011. For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, equipment and parts sales increased by 6.6% and 4.6%, respectively, over fiscal 2011 attributable to a reorganized sales staff which enabled the Company to have greater penetration of its territory. Although the economy is still unstable, new orders have been trending higher, increasing the Company’s backlog at year end 2012 compared to 2011. During the year foreign sales also increased by 3.8%.     10     Table of Contents      Revenues of development fees, franchising and license fees, commission and other income increased by $19,268 (5.3%) in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011. The improvement can be attributed to the reorganization of our Mexican licensing operations and an increase in equipment restocking charges, which offset a substantial commission received in fiscal 2011 on a sale by another distributor for an installation in the Company’s territory.             Year Ended June 30,               2012         2011       As a percentage of net sales:                             Cost of sales, net         76.7 %         76.4 %     As a percentage of revenues:                             Selling, general and administrative expenses         21.0 %         20.4 %     Total expenses         96.4 %         95.5 %   Cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased to 76.7% in fiscal 2012 from 76.4% in fiscal 2011. The percentage varies slightly from year to year due to the mix of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $364,308 (8.4%) in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 21.0% from 20.4%. The increase was mostly attributable to the increase in payroll expenses as a result of the reorganization and expansion of the sales staff. Also contributing to the increase were stockholder expenses, as the Company now must adhere to XBRL reporting requirements, and professional fees. Offsetting these increases in administrative expenses were decreases in office expenses, service engineering and travel and entertainment expenses. Interest income decreased by $2,171 (10.0%) in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, mostly due to lower prevailing interest rates. The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 38.2% in fiscal 2012 from 38.1% in fiscal 2011. The slight variation in percentage reflects changes in both permanent and temporary adjustments to taxable income. Inflation Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company’s operations during any of the reported periods. Transactions with Related Parties The Company leases 27,000 square feet of warehouse and office space from the Sheila Steiner Revocable Trust. The trustees of this trust are Sheila Steiner, her husband, William K. Steiner, and her son, Michael S. Steiner. William K. Steiner is Chairman of the Board of Directors and a director of the Company and Michael S. Steiner is President and a director of the Company. Michael Steiner, individually, is also a principal shareholder of the Company. Annual rental expense under this lease was approximately $119,600 in fiscal 2012 and $116,100 in fiscal 2011. The lease was for an original three year term which commenced on November 1, 2005, with two three-year renewal options in favor of the Company. The Company has exercised the second renewal option, extending the lease until October 31, 2014. The lease provides for annual rent increases commencing November 1, 2006 of 3% over the rent in the prior year. The Company bears the cost of real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, non-structural repairs and insurance. The Company believes that the terms of the lease are comparable to terms that would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party for similar property in a similar locale. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company paid a law firm, in which a director is Senior Counsel, approximately $59,300 and $44,300, respectively, for legal services performed.     11     Table of Contents      Critical Accounting Policies Securities and Exchange Commission Financial Reporting Release No. 60 encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements: Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, leases and mortgages, the carrying value of inventories and long-lived assets, the timing of revenue recognition for initial license and franchise fees from sales of franchise arrangements and continuing license and franchise service fees, as well as sales returns. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recognition of revenues and expenses and the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition and Accounts and Trade Notes Receivable Products are generally shipped Freight on Board (FOB) from the Company’s warehouse or drop shipped from the Company’s Vendor FOB, at which time risk of loss and title passes to the purchaser. Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of the arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. In some cases, the Company collects non-income related taxes, including sales and use tax, from its customers and remits those taxes to governmental authorities. The Company presents revenues net of these taxes. Shipping, delivery and handling fee income is included in revenues in the consolidated financial statements. Shipping, delivery and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Commissions and development fees are recorded when earned, generally when the services are performed or the transaction is closed. Individual franchise arrangements include a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing royalties. Initial franchise fees are generally recorded upon the opening of the franchised store, which is evidenced by a certificate from the franchisee, indicating that the store has opened, and collectability is reasonably assured. Continuing royalties represent regular contractual payments received for the use of the “DRYCLEAN USA” marks, which are recognized as revenue when earned, generally on a straight line basis. Accounts and trade notes receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company sells its products primarily to independent and franchise dry clean stores and chains, laundry plants, hotels, motels, cruise lines, hospitals, nursing homes, government institutions and distributors. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, depending on the term of credit, the amount of the credit granted and management’s past history with a customer, the Company may require the customer to grant a security interest in the purchased equipment as collateral for the receivable. Senior management reviews accounts and trade notes receivable on a regular basis to determine if any such amounts will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve based on older aged amounts, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off. Based on the information available to management, it believes the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 is adequate. However, actual write-offs might exceed the recorded allowance.     12     Table of Contents      Franchise License, Trademark and Other Intangible Assets Franchise licenses, trademarks, patents and trade names are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Those assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited (10-15 years). Patents are amortized over the shorter of the patents’ useful life or legal life from the date such patents are granted. The Company reviews the recoverability of intangible assets based primarily upon an analysis of undiscounted cash flows from the intangible assets. In the event the expected future net cash flows should become less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss will be recorded in the period the determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets. Income Taxes The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. Significant judgment is required in developing the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. Management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely that the asset will not be realized. The Company follows ASC Topic 740-10-25, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The Company does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax benefits related to certain tax positions taken on its various income tax returns. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state authorities for the years 2008 through 2011.     13     Table of Contents      Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance: In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements” (“ASU 2010-06”). ASU 2010-06 amends ASC Topic 820 and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). ASU 2010-06 became effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2010, except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 roll forward, which was required for annual reporting periods beginning July 1, 2011 and for interim reporting periods thereafter. Early application was permitted and comparative disclosures were not required in the period of initial adoption. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, “Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Loss” (“ASU 2010-20”). ASU 2010-20 amends ASC 310, “Receivables” to enhance disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses by requiring an entity to provide a greater level of disaggregated information and to disclose credit quality indicators, past due information, and modifications of its financing receivables. ASU 2010-20 is effective for interim or annual fiscal years for the Company beginning January 1, 2011. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2010-20 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, “Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring” (“ASU 2011-02”). ASU 2011-02 provides additional guidance clarifying when the restructuring of a receivable should be considered a troubled debt restructuring. The additional guidance provided by ASU 2011-02 is for determining whether a creditor has granted a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2011-02 also ends the deferral of activity-based disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings. The Company adopted ASU 2011-02 in the third quarter of 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-02 did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs” (“ASU 2011-04”).  ASU 2011-04 amends ASC 820, providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.  ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles, clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the ASC 820 disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements.  ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.  The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.       14     Table of Contents            Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitiative Disclosures About Market Risk     48                       ITEM 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Overview   Magyar Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware-chartered mid-tier stock holding company whose most significant business activity is ownership of 100% of the common stock of Magyar Bank. Magyar Bank’s principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, principal repayments on loans and securities and borrowed funds, into one-to four-family residential mortgage loans, multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial business loans and construction loans. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income is primarily affected by the market interest rate environment, the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, the timing of the placement of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the prepayment rate on our mortgage-related assets. Other factors that may affect our results of operations are general and local economic and competitive conditions, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities.   On April 22, 2010, the Bank entered into agreements with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance which required the Bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness. In connection with these agreements, the Bank stipulated to the issuance of consent orders against the Bank (the "Consent Orders") relating to certain findings from a recent examination of the Bank. In entering into the stipulation and consenting to entry of the Consent Orders, the Bank did not concede the findings or admit to any of the assertions therein. The Consent Orders imposed no fines or penalties upon the Bank.   Among the corrective actions required were for the Bank to develop, within 30 days of the April 22, 2010 effective date of the Consent Orders, a written capital plan that detailed the manner in which the Bank would achieve a Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank's total assets of at least 8%, and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of at least 12%. On March 2, 2012 the Bank was informed in writing by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, that the Consent Order had been terminated. The Bank is required to maintain Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank's total assets of at least 8%, and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of at least 12%. At September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank’s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank's total assets was 8.40% and the total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets was 13.21%.   During the year ended September 30, 2012, net loans increased $4.0 million, or 1.1%, despite a $16.2 million, or 47.4%, decrease in construction loans. The contraction in the construction loan portfolio was due to the decision to cease originations of new construction loans in 2008 based on the adverse economic environment and its impact on this type of lending. Due to the difficult economic environment and the need to increase capital ratios, the repayments of these loans were used to shrink the Bank’s balance sheet by reducing higher-cost borrowings and deposits.   Borrowing decreased $8.4 million, or 16.9%, and deposits decreased $8.4 million, or 2.0%, during the year ended September 30, 2012. Balances of certificates of deposit (including individual retirement accounts) declined $17.1 million, or 9.7%, reflecting the Bank’s continued strategy of shifting funding sources from higher cost certificates of deposit and borrowings to lower cost checking accounts, which increased $13.4 million, or 43.2%, during the year. The shift in funding helped contribute to a $1.6 million, or 21.6%, decrease in the Company’s interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities from $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 to $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012. We attribute the decrease in the average interest expense to the expansion of our commercial relationships, which tend to hold larger deposit balances, successful business development efforts by our retail branch managers, and the continued growth of the Bank’s two newest branch facilities.       38     Table of Contents      The Company reported net income of $509,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012. Net income increased $758,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with a net loss of $249,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011, attributable to a $169,000 increase in net interest income and a $714,000 decrease in other expenses.   Loan loss provisions decreased $287,000 to $1.5 million during the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with $1.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 due to lower level of loan charge-offs and the decrease in the total loan receivables during the current period, specifically construction loan balances, which required higher levels of reserves.   Throughout 2013, we expect to continue the resolution of non-performing assets, diversifying our balance sheet with higher concentrations in commercial real estate and commercial business loans, and managing non-interest expenses in order to increase profitability of the Company.     Critical Accounting Policies   Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Critical accounting policies may involve complex subjective decisions or assessments. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies. Allowance for Loan Loss. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover credit losses in the loan portfolio both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical. Due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses, the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management. As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. We consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions. The evaluation has a specific and general component. The specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as impaired through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system. All such loans are evaluated individually, with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan and discounted cash flows. Specific impairment allowances are established as required by this analysis. However, the Bank’s Federal and State regulators generally require that the specific reserve against impaired loans be charged-off, reducing the carrying balance of the loan and allowance for loan loss. The general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations in establishing the general portion of the reserve. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses.     39     Table of Contents      Actual loan losses may be significantly greater than the allowances we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.   Deferred Income Taxes. The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities: (i) are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns; (ii) are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases; and (iii) are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.   Deferred tax assets have been reduced by a valuation allowance for all portions determined not likely to be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period of enactment. The valuation allowance is adjusted, by a charge or credit to income tax expense, as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.     Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011   Total Assets. Total assets decreased $15.2 million, or 2.9%, to $508.8 million at September 30, 2012 from $524.0 million at September 30, 2011, due to reductions in investment securities, cash and cash equivalents and other real estate owned, partially offset by an increase in net loan receivables.   Loans Receivable. Net loans receivable increased $4.0 million, or 1.1%, to $385.3 million at September 30, 2012 from $381.3 million at September 30, 2011. During the year ended September 30, 2012, construction loans decreased $16.2 million, or 47.4%, to $18.0 million at September 30, 2012 from $34.1 million at September 30, 2011. In addition, commercial business loans decreased $6.3 million, or 17.3%, to $29.9 million from $36.2 million, and one-to four-family residential mortgage loans decreased $1.7 million, or 1.1%, to $157.5 million from $159.2 million. Offsetting the decreases was a $27.8 million, or 23.0%, increase in commercial real estate loans to $148.8 million from $121.0 million and a $403,000, or 1.2%, increase in home equity lines of credit and other loans to $34.7 million from $34.3 million.   At September 30, 2012, the significant loan categories in terms of the percent of total loans were 40.5% in one-to four-family residential mortgage loans and 38.3% in commercial real estate loans. The remaining categories were comprised of 7.7% in commercial business loans, and 8.9% in home equity lines of credit and other loans, which consisted primarily of stock-secured consumer loans and 4.6% in construction loans.   Total non-performing and restructured loans decreased $10.2 million to $22.7 million at September 30, 2012 from $32.9 million at September 30, 2011. Excluding troubled debt restructurings, non-performing loans decreased $8.1 million, or 28.7%, to $20.1 million. Non-performing loans consisted of six construction loan relationships totaling $5.1 million, twenty-four mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties totaling $7.6 million, eight commercial real estate loans totaling $6.4 million, eight home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans totaling $875,000, and two commercial business loan totaling $57,000.   Adverse economic conditions have led to high levels of non-performing loans, particularly in the Company’s construction loan portfolio. The repayment of construction loans is typically dependent upon the sale of the collateral securing the loan, which has been negatively impacted by significant deterioration in the housing market and decreased buyer demand. As a result, construction projects have slowed and reached their maturity dates. In order for the Company to extend the loans beyond the original maturity date, the value of the collateral securing the loan must be assessed, which is typically done by obtaining an updated third-party appraisal. Given the deterioration in the economy and, specifically, the housing market, updated valuations of the collateral reflect depreciation from earlier assessments. To the extent that the current appraised value of collateral is insufficient to cover a collateral-dependent loan, the Company reduces the balance of the loan via a charge to the allowance for loan loss.   Non-performing loans secured by one-to four-family residential properties, including home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans, increased $3.6 million to $8.4 million at September 30, 2012 from $4.8 million at September 30, 2011. Magyar Bank had begun foreclosure proceedings on the majority of the properties as of September 30, 2012. During the year ended September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank charged off $407,000 from these loans through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss. There were six troubled debt restructurings of loans secured by a one-to four-family residential property totaling $2.3 million that were performing at their restructured terms at September 30, 2012.   Non-performing construction loans decreased $10.3 million, or 66.8%, to $5.1 million at September 30, 2012 from $15.5 million at September 30, 2011. The real estate securing these loans consists of vacant and partially completed residential lots in various locations in the State of New Jersey. Magyar Bank is determining the proper course of action to collect the principal outstanding on these loans including foreclosure of collateral and pursuit of personal guarantors on the loans. During the year ended September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank charged off $880,000 in non-performing construction loan balances through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss. There were no troubled debt restructurings of construction loans during the year ended September 30, 2012.       40     Table of Contents      Construction loans may contain interest reserves on which the interest is capitalized. At September 30, 2012, there were two performing construction loans with interest reserves representing outstanding balances of $893,000, an original interest reserve of $169,000, an advanced interest reserve of $9,000, and a remaining interest reserve balance of $160,000.   Underwriting for construction loans with and without interest reserves has followed a uniform process. Construction loan progress is monitored by loan on a monthly basis by management of the Bank as well as by the Board of Directors. Each time an advance is requested, an inspection is made of the project by an outside engineer or appraiser, depending on the size and complexity of the project, to determine the amount of work completed and if the costs to date are supported adequately. The Bank’s construction loan operations personnel compare the advance request with the original budget and remaining loan funds available to ensure the project is in balance and that at all times the amount remaining on the loan is sufficient to complete the project.   A number of the Bank’s construction loans have been extended due to slower sales as a result of worsening economic conditions. In cases where updated appraisals reflect collateral values insufficient to cover the loan, additional collateral and/or a principal reduction is required to extend the loan. Some of the Bank’s loans that originally had interest reserves are non-performing. The Bank does not currently have any non-performing loans with active interest reserves. Once a loan is deemed impaired, any interest reserve is frozen and the loan is placed on non-accrual so that no future interest income is recorded on these loans. The Bank ceased originating new non-owner occupied construction loans in October 2008.   Non-performing commercial real estate loans decreased $1.2 million, or 15.4%, to $6.4 million at September 30, 2012 from $7.6 million at September 30, 2011. Magyar Bank had begun foreclosure proceedings on the properties securing these loans at September 30, 2012. During the year ended September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank had charged off $110,000 in non-performing commercial real estate loan balances through a reduction of its allowance for loan loss. There was  one troubled debt restructurings of commercial real estate loan totaling $245,000 that was performing at its restructured term during the year ended September 30, 2012.   Non-performing commercial business loans decreased $198,000, or 77.6%, to $57,000 at September 30, 2012 from $255,000 at September 30, 2011. Magyar Bank is determining the proper course of action to collect the principal outstanding on these loans which will include foreclosure proceedings for those loans secured by real estate. During the year ended September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank had charged off $69,000 in non-performing commercial business loans for the year ended September 30, 2012. There were no troubled debt restructurings of commercial business loans during the year ended September 30, 2012.   The ratio of non-performing loans and troubled debt restructurings to total loans receivable decreased to 5.83% at September 30, 2012 from 8.55% at September 30, 2011. The allowance for loan losses increased $46,000 to $3.9 million, or 19.2% of non-performing loans, at September 30, 2012 compared with $3.8 million, or 13.5% of non-performing loans, at September 30, 2011. Provisions for loan loss during the year ended September 30, 2012 were $1.5 million while net charge-offs were $1.4 million, compared with a provision of $1.7 million and net charge-offs of $2.7 million for the prior year period. The allowance for loan losses was 0.99% of gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2012 and 2011.   Investment Securities. Investment securities decreased $12.5 million, or 17.7%, to $57.9 million at September 30, 2012 from $70.3 million at September 30, 2011.   Securities available-for-sale decreased $8.5 million, or 33.7%, to $16.8 million at September 30, 2012 from $25.3 million at September 30, 2011. The decrease was the result of $14.9 million in sales and maturities and $3.7 million in principal amortization, partially offset by $10.2 million in purchases of mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government-sponsored enterprise obligations. In addition, the unrealized gain on the available-for-sale portfolio decreased $10,000 to $484,000 at September 30, 2012 compared with $494,000 at the prior year end.   Securities held-to-maturity decreased $3.9 million, or 8.7%, to $41.1 million at September 30, 2012 from $45.0 million at September 30, 2011. The decrease was the result of $12.6 million in maturities and calls and $8.4 million in principal amortization, offset by $17.2 million in security purchases,       41     Table of Contents      Bank-Owned Life Insurance. The cash surrender value of life insurance held for directors and executive officers of Magyar Bank increased $350,000, or 3.6%, to $10.0 million at September 30, 2012 from $9.7 million at September 30, 2011. The increase in bank-owned life insurance was due to the increase in the cash surrender value of the existing policies.   Other Real Estate Owned. Other real estate owned decreased $3.2 million to $13.4 million at September 30, 2012 from $16.6 million at September 30, 2011.   During the year ended September 30, 2012, the Company was able to successfully dispose of six properties totaling $8.5 million at a net loss of $22,000, invested $1.2 million and was able to obtain title for seven other properties totaling $5.8 million previously securing non-performing loans. Other real estate owned at September 30, 2012 consisted of ten completed residential properties, three partially completed residential properties, thirteen real estate lots approved for the construction of residential homes, and two commercial real estate buildings. The Bank is determining the proper course of action for its other real estate owned, which may include holding the properties until the real estate market improves, selling the properties to a developer and completing partially completed homes for either rental or sale.   Deposits. Total deposits decreased $8.4 million, or 2.0%, to $416.5 million at September 30, 2012 from $424.9 million at September 30, 2011.   The Company’s deposit strategy during the year ended September 30, 2012 was focused on increasing and expanding customer relationships with Magyar Bank, including higher balance commercial deposit accounts. As a result of this strategy, the Bank was able to continue replacing higher-cost, single service time deposit account holders with lower-cost checking account balances.   The contraction in deposits during the twelve months ended September 30, 2012 occurred in certificates of deposit (including individual retirement accounts), which decreased $17.1 million, or 9.7%, to $158.5 million from $175.6 for the same period of last year. Savings decreased $5.2 million, or 8.7%, to $55.3 million compared to $60.5 million for the same period of last year. Partially offsetting this decrease was a $13.9 million, or 7.4%, increase in checking accounts (including money market accounts) to $202.8 million from $188.9 for the same period of last year. Deposits accounted for 81.9% of assets and 108.1% of net loans at September 30, 2012.   At September 30, 2012, the Company held $7.5 million in brokered certificates of deposit and no Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS) Reciprocal certificates of deposit. At September 30, 2011, the Company held $1.8 million in CDARS Reciprocal certificates of deposit and $10.0 million in brokered certificates of deposit.   Borrowed Funds. Borrowings decreased $8.4 million, or 16.9% to $41.5 million at September 30, 2012 from $49.9 million at September 30, 2011.   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $10.0 million as maturing borrowings were paid off with excess cash. Borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased to 8.2% of assets at September 30, 2012 from 9.5% at September 30, 2011.   Stockholders’ Equity. Stockholders’ equity increased $496,000, or 1.1%, to $45.0 million at September 30, 2012 from $44.5 million at September 30, 2011. The increase in stockholders’ equity was attributable to the Company’s results from operations for the year ended September 30, 2012.   During the year ended September 30, 2012, the Company repurchased 14,030 shares of its common stock. Under the current stock repurchase program, 48,924 shares of the 129,924 shares authorized remained available for repurchase at September 30, 2012.     Comparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended September 30, 2012 and 2011   Net Income (Loss). The Company’s net income was $509,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012, reflecting a $758,000 increase from a net loss of $249,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011.   Net Interest and Dividend Income. Net interest and dividend income increased $169,000, or 1.1%, to $15.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2012 from $14.8 million during the year ended September 30, 2011. Interest and dividend income decreased $1.4 million, or 6.4%, to $20.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $22.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2011 while interest expense decreased $1.6 million, or 21.6%, to $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.     42     Table of Contents        Average Balance Sheet. The following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. The table presents the annualized average yield on interest-earning assets and the annualized average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. We derived the yields and costs by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown. We derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated.

The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by average volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in average volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.               September 30,               2012 vs. 2011         2011 vs. 2010               Increase (decrease)                   Increase (decrease)                         due to                   due to                         Volume         Rate         Net         Volume         Rate         Net               (Dollars in thousands)       Interest-earning assets:                                                                             Interest-earning deposits       $ 2         $ 11         $ 13         $ 20         $ (3 )       $ 17       Loans         (495 )         (808 )         (1,303 )         (1,606 )         (882 )         (2,488 )     Securities                                                                             Taxable         1           (92 )         (91 )         146           (556 )         (410 )     Tax-exempt (1)                     (0 )         (3 )         (2 )         3           1       FHLB of NY stock         (16 )         (29 )         (45 )         (23 )         13         (10 )     Total interest-earning assets         (511 )         (918 )         (1,429 )         (1,465 )         (1,425 )         (2,890 )                                                                                   Interest-bearing liabilities:                                                                             Savings accounts (2)         (19 )         (132 )         (151 )         (3 )         (223 )         (226 )     NOW accounts (3)         52           (427 )         (375 )         33           (411 )         (378 )     Time deposits (4)         (262 )         (375 )         (637 )         (436 )         (440 )         (876 )     Total interest-bearing deposits         (228 )         (935 )         (1,163 )         (406 )         (1,074 )         (1,480 )     Borrowings         (345 )         (89 )         (434 )         (385 )         (40 )         (425 )     Total interest-bearing liabilities         (573 )         (1,024 )         (1,597 )         (791 )         (1,114 )         (1,905 )                                                                                   Increase (decrease) in tax equivalent                                                                             net interest income       $ 63         $ 106           168         $ (674 )       $ (311 )         (985 )     Change in tax-equivalent basis adjustment                                 1                                   (2 )                                                                                   Increase (decrease) in net interest income                               $ 169                                 $ (987 )   (1) Calculated using 34% tax rate for periods.

Interest and dividend income decreased $1.4 million, or 6.4%, to $20.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $22.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower yields on interest-bearing assets, which decreased 20 basis points to 4.46%, and lower balances of such assets, which decreased $10.0 million, or 2.1%, to $466.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012.   Interest income on loans decreased $1.3 million, or 6.5%, to $18.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $20.0 million for the prior year. The decrease was attributable to a decrease of $10.4 million, or 2.6%, in the average balance of loans as well as a 21 basis point decrease in the average yield on such loans to 4.88% from 5.09%. The decline in yield on loans reflected the lower interest rate environment for loans during the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011.   Interest earned on investment securities, excluding Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock, and interest earning deposits decreased $80,000, or 3.9%, to $1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $2.0 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 14 basis point decrease in the average yield on securities to 2.82% from 2.96% for the prior year period which more than offset a $12,000 increase in the average balance of investment securities to $68.63 million from $68.62 million for the prior year. The decline in the yield on investment securities reflected the lower interest rate environment during the year ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.     44     Table of Contents        Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $1.6 million, or 21.6%, to $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities decreased $18.4 million between the two periods while the cost of such liabilities fell 31 basis points to 1.38% for the year ended September 30, 2012.   The average balance of interest-bearing deposits decreased $9.4 million to $371.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $380.4 million for the prior year while the average cost of such deposits decreased 28 basis points to 1.06% from 1.34%. This resulted in a $1.2 million, or 22.8%, decrease in interest expense on deposits to $3.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $5.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.   Interest expense on advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $434,000 to $1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $2.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The average cost of borrowings decreased 15 basis points to 3.81% for the year ended September 30, 2012 from 3.96% for the year ended September 30, 2011. The average balance of advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $9.1 million to $49.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $58.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.   Provision for Loan Losses. We establish provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, peer group information and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur. After an evaluation of these factors, management made a provision of $1.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with a $1.7 million provision for the prior year.   Provisions for loan loss for the year ended September 30, 2012 decreased $287,000 from the prior year period due to lower levels of loan charge-offs and lower levels of higher risk loan categories. Net charge-offs totaled $1.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to net charge-offs of $2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2011, reflecting a 48% decrease. The lower level of loan charge-offs resulted from fewer impaired loans at September 30, 2012, in comparison with September 30, 2011, and lower charge-offs of previously impaired loans in comparison to the prior year period due to the stabilization of real estate values. In addition, construction loans, which typically require higher levels of allowance for loan loss, declined 47% during the year.   Total non-performing and restructured loans decreased $10.2 million, or 31.1%, to $22.7 million at September 30, 2012 from $32.9 million at September 30, 2011. Excluding troubled debt restructurings, non-performing loans decreased $8.1 million, or 28.7%, to $20.1 million from $28.2 million. The allowance for loan losses increased $46,000 to $3.9 million, or 0.99% of gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2012, from $3.8 million, or 0.99% of gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2011.   Other Income. Non-interest income decreased $334,000, or 13.4%, to $2.2 million during the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to $2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2011.   Non-interest income declined due to lower service charge income, which decreased $190,000, and lower gains on the sales of assets, which were $752,000 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2012 compared with $878,000 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2011.   The Company’s gains on the sales of mortgage loans decreased $279,000 to $466,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $745,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011. The Company sold 35 servicing retained residential mortgage loans totaling $8.3 million to Freddie Mac and three SBA 7(a) loans totaling $910,000 during the year ended September 30, 2012. During the prior year period, the Company sold 62 servicing retained residential mortgage loans, totaling $11.0 million to Freddie Mac, and seven SBA 7(a) loans, totaling $1.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2011. The Company’s gains from the sales of investment securities increased $153,000 to $286,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $133,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011.   Other Expenses. Other expenses decreased $714,000, or 4.5%, to $15.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared to $15.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was attributable to lower FDIC insurance premiums, compensation and benefits, and OREO expenses.       45     Table of Contents      The FDIC insurance assessments paid by the Bank decreased $429,000 to $706,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $1.1 million for the prior year period. The decrease resulted from a lower assessment base as well as lower assessment rates during the current fiscal year.   Employee and benefit expenses decreased $251,000, or 3.3%, to $7.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $7.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. The decrease was primarily the result of lower stock-based compensation due to the final vesting of stock options and stock awards granted after the Company’s IPO.   OREO expense decreased $78,000, or 8.8%, to $810,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $888,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011 due to a decrease in the balance of OREO to $13.4 million from $16.6 million during the same period. OREO expenses include real estate taxes, property and casualty insurance, utilities, and general maintenance expenses.   Partially offsetting the decline in other expenses was a $109,000, or 3.9%, increase in occupancy expenses to $2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 from $2.8 million for the prior year period. The Bank experienced higher occupancy expenses from the opening of its sixth branch location in North Edison, NJ in June of 2011.   Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded a tax expense of $121,000 for the year ended September 30, 2012 compared with $43,000 for the year ended September 30, 2011. The effective tax rates for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were 19.2% and 20.9%.   Included in the tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2012 was a current period tax expense of $20,000 and a deferred tax expense of $101,000. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended September 30, 2012 was a decrease of approximately $26,000 based upon management’s assessment of current and projected future operations.     Management of Market Risk   General . The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of mortgage loans, have longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has established an Asset and Liability Management Committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the Asset and Liability Committee meets at least on a quarterly basis to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position.   We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates. As part of our ongoing asset-liability management, we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by retaining in our loan portfolio fewer fixed rate residential loans, by originating and retaining adjustable-rate loans in the residential, construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios, by using alternative funding sources, such as advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, to “match fund” longer-term residential and commercial mortgage loans, and by originating and retaining variable rate home equity and short-term and medium-term fixed-rate commercial business loans. We have also increased money market account deposits as a percentage of our total deposits. Money market accounts offer a variable rate based on market indications. Finally, we have purchased interest rate floors and sold securities under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives to mitigate the impact of interest rates on our prime-based loans. At September 30, 2012 we held securities sold under agreements to repurchase with embedded derivatives in the amount of $5.0 million. By following these strategies, we believe that we are well-positioned to react to changes in market interest rates. Net Interest Income Analysis. The table below sets forth, as of September 30, 2012, the estimated changes in our Net Interest Income (“NII”) for each of the next two years that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in interest rates. These estimates require making certain assumptions including loan and mortgage-related investment prepayment speeds, reinvestment rates, and deposit maturities and decay rates. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions. Further, certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the interest rate risk measurement. Modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.       46     Table of Contents            Change in                 Estimated Decrease                   Estimated Decrease       Interest rates       Estimated         in NII Year 1         Estimated         in NII Year 2       (Basis Points) (1)       NII Year 1         Amount         Percentage         NII Year 2         Amount         Percentage       (Dollars in thousands)                                                                       +200       $ 15,042         $ (13 )         -0.09 %       $ 14,962         $ 156           1.05 %     Unchanged         15,055           —           —           14,806           —           —       -100         14,723           (332 )         -2.21 %         14,288           (518 )         -3.50 %     (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities and sales of securities. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We seek to maintain a liquidity ratio of 5.0% of assets or greater. The liquidity ratio is calculated by determining the sum of the difference between liquid assets (cash and unpledged investment securities) and short-term liabilities (estimated 30-day deposit outflows), borrowing capacity from the FHLBNY, and brokered deposit capacity and dividing the sum by total assets. At September 30, 2012, our liquidity ratio was 10.3% of assets. We regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest-earning deposits and short- and intermediate-term securities. Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At September 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents totaled $10.0 million. Securities classified as available-for-sale, which provide additional sources of liquidity from sales, totaled $16.8 million at September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012, we also had the ability to borrow $78.7 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. On that date, we had an aggregate of $35.1 million in advances outstanding. Our cash flows are derived from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Statements of Cash Flows included in our Financial Statements. At September 30, 2012, we had $16.1 million in loan origination commitments outstanding. In addition to commitments to originate loans, we had $41.2 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2013 totaled $78.7 million, or 18.9% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2013. We believe, however, that based on past experience a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities. For the year ended September 30, 2012, we originated $65.4 million of loans and purchased $27.4 million of securities. Financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We experienced a net decrease in total deposits of $8.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2012 and a net decrease in total deposits of $3.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2011. Deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates, the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors.     47     Table of Contents      Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. If we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which provide an additional source of funds. Federal Home Loan Bank advances totaled $36.5 million and $34.9 million at September 30, 2012 and September 30, 2011, respectively. Federal Home Loan Bank advances have primarily been used to fund loan demand. Magyar Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measures to maintain Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank's total assets of at least 8%, and total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets of at least 12% (see “Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements”). As of September 30, 2012, Magyar Bank’s Tier 1 capital as a percentage of the Bank's total assets was 8.40% and the total qualifying capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets was 13.21%. Bank-owned life insurance is a tax-advantaged financing transaction that is used to offset employee benefit plan costs. Policies are purchased insuring directors and officers of Magyar Bank using a single premium method of payment. Magyar Bank is the owner and beneficiary of the policies and records tax-free income through cash surrender value accumulation. We have minimized our credit exposure by choosing carriers that are highly rated and limiting the concentration of any one carrier. The investment in bank-owned life insurance has no significant impact on our capital and liquidity.   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations   Commitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by us. For additional information, see Note P, “Lease Commitments,” and Note Q “Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” to our Financial Statements.   Contractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment.   The following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at September 30, 2012. The payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments.               Payments Due by Period               Less Than         One to         Three to         More Than                         One Year         Three Years         Five Years         Five Years         Total               (Dollars in thousands)       Federal Home Loan Bank advances       $ 9,143         $ 13,700         $ 6,760         $ 5,500         $ 35,103       Repurchase agreements         —           5,000           —           —           5,000       Operating leases         559           1,136           1,209           5,713           8,617       Total       $ 9,702         $ 19,836         $ 7,969         $ 11,213         $ 48,720           ITEM 7A.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the captions “Risk Factors”. In addition, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.   Overview   Financial Information Concerning Industry Segments   Our business is conducted principally in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry segments for the two fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 is set forth in the consolidated financial statements which are attached hereto.     General   At September 29, 2012, we (i) operated 24 units, (excluding the adult entertainment club referenced in (ii) below), consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; (ii) own but do not operate one adult entertainment club; and (iii) franchise an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants, (one of which we operate), and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores.   Franchised Units . In exchange for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks "Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill" and "Big Daddy's Liquors", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package liquor sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales.       34     Table of Contents      Affiliated Limited Partnership Owned Units . We manage and control the operations of the eight restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami, Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner. This new restaurant opened for business on December 27, 2012. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method.       Results of Operations                                                                                           REVENUES (in thousands):                                                     Fifty Two         Fifty Two               Weeks Ended         Weeks Ended               Sept. 29, 2012         Oct. 1, 2011       Sales                                                                                                           Restaurant, food       $ 48,943           64.9%         $ 45,951           64.8%       Restaurant, bar         13,255           17.6%           11,814           16.7%       Package goods         13,214           17.5%           13,141           18.5%       Total         75,412           100.0%           70,906           100.0%                                                             Franchise related revenues         1,133                       1,023                   Owner’s fee         157                       161                   Other operating income         158                       219                   Rental income         475                       —                   Total Revenues       $ 77,335                     $ 72,309                     35     Table of Contents      Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011   Revenues. Total revenue for our fiscal year 2012 increased $5,026,000 or 6 .95 % to $77,335,000 from $72,309,000 for our fiscal year 2011. The increase in total revenue during our fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to revenue generated from the sale of food at our restaurants caused by our increasing our menu prices during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2011 and the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants caused by our increasing our bar liquor prices during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012. Restaurant Food Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled $48,943,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $45,951,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, which consists of eight restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $911,000 and $853,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 6.80%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company owned restaurants only was $405,000 and $370,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 9.46%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $506,000 and $483,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 4.76%. The increase in restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food at restaurants was primarily caused by our increasing menu prices during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2011 and the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012. Restaurant Bar Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $13,255,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $11,814,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, which consists of eight restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $247,000 and $220,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 12.27%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company owned restaurants only was $105,000 and $94,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 11.70%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $142,000 and $126,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 12.70%. The increase in restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants was primarily caused by our increasing our bar liquor prices during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012.  Package Liquor Store Sales . Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $13,214,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $13,141,000 for our fiscal year 2011, an increase of $73,000 or 0.56%. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes all nine (9) Company owned package liquor stores, was $254,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $253,000 for our fiscal year 2011.       36     Table of Contents      Operating Costs and Expenses . Operating costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses), for our fiscal year 2012 increased $4,582,000 or 6.62% to $73,764,000 from $69,182,000 for our fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily due to the costs related to our new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012  and opened for business on December 27, 2012, the shopping center in Miami, Florida acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and to an expected general increase in food costs, including an increase in the cost of poultry , offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance to our units and actions taken by management to reduce and/or control costs and expenses. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year 2013 for the same reasons. Operating costs and expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales to approximately 95.38% in our fiscal year 2012 from 95.68% in our fiscal year 2011.    Gross Profit . Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales.   Restaurant Food and Bar Sales . Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2012 increased to $40,059,000 from $37,857,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 64.41% for our fiscal year 2012 and 65.54% for our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease during our fiscal year 2013 due to higher food costs, including our cost of poultry, offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year 2013. Package Liquor Store Sales . Gross profit for package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2012 decreased to $4,102,000 from $4,381,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our gross profit margin (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales) for package liquor store sales was 31.04% for our fiscal year 2012 and 33.34% for our fiscal year 2011. The decrease in our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales during our fiscal year 2012 (-2.30%) was due to our inability to purchase “close out” and inventory reduction merchandise from wholesalers which we were able to obtain during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year 2013. Payroll and Related Costs . Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2012 increased $1,642,000 or 7.56% to $23,354,000 from $21,712,000 for our fiscal year 2011 due primarily to an increase in the Florida minimum wage (4.92%), which was effective January 1, 2012, and to increases in payroll taxes, including unemployment taxes. We anticipate that our payroll and related costs will increase throughout our fiscal year 2013 due primarily to payroll associated with the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and  opened for business on December 27, 2012. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total sales was 30.20% in our fiscal year 2012 and 30.03% of total sales in our fiscal year 2011.  Occupancy Costs . Occupancy costs (consisting of rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes and amortization of leasehold interests) for our fiscal year 2012 increased $64,000 or 1.48% to $4,328,000 from $4,264,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our occupancy costs increased primarily due to increasing percentage rents at various locations and due to rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership, which commenced January 27, 2012, partially offset by the elimination of rent from a limited partnership owned restaurant located in the shopping center in Miami, Florida which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and the elimination of rent paid for our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at 13205 Biscayne Boulevard, North Miami, Florida, the real property and building of which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year 2013 as rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida, will be offset by the reduction in rental payments as a result of our purchase of the building on November 30, 2011 where Store #70 is located.     37     Table of Contents      Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2012 increased $293,000 or 2.02% to $14,831,000 from $14,538,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales in our fiscal year 2012 to 19.18% as compared to 20.11% in our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase throughout our fiscal year 2013 due primarily to the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and opened for business on December 27, 2012, the shopping center acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and increases across all categories. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for our fiscal year 2012 decreased $42,000 or 1.63% to $2,528,000 from $2,570,000 for our fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 3.27% of revenue for our fiscal year 2012 and 3.55% of revenue for our fiscal year 2011. Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense for our fiscal year 2012 increased $191,000 to $806,000 from $615,000 for our fiscal year 2011. I nterest expense increased during our fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the interest paid on the $4.5 million mortgage loan, the proceeds of which we used to purchase a shopping center in Miami, Florida and a $1.6 million term loan the proceeds of which were also ultimately used to purchase the shopping center, while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves.    Net Income Attributable to Stockholders . Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2012 decreased $36,000 or 2.48% to $1,413,000 from $1,449,000 for our fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of sales, net income for our fiscal year 2012 is 1.83%, as compared to 2.00% in our fiscal year 2011. During our fiscal year 2011, we recognized income of $231,000, offset by income tax of $67,000, from the sale of our interest, as guarantor, of a nine (9) year leasehold interest. Without giving effect to the above non-recurring item, our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2012 would have increased $128,000 or 9.96% to $1,285,000 for our fiscal year 2011.       38     Table of Contents      New Limited Partnership Restaurants    As new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2012, we recognized pre-opening rent expense in the approximate amount of $83,000 for the Miami, Florida restaurant which opened for business on December 27, 2012. During our fiscal year 2011, we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre-opening rent. We are recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.   During our fiscal year 2012, the limited partnership restaurant in Miami, Florida which opened for business on December 27, 2012, reported losses of $107,000 primarily due to pre-opening costs, thus contributing to a reduction in the operating income for our fiscal year 2012. During our fiscal year 2011, we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre-opening costs.   We believe that our current cash on hand, together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.   Trends   During the next twelve months, we expect that our restaurant food and bar sales will increase , but gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease due to higher food costs, including our cost of poultry, offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year 2013. We anticipate that our package liquor store sales and gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year 2013. We expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income. W e also plan to continue our increased advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition. With our recent menu price increases, we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible, but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses, which will adversely affect our net income. We may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible. We currently have a new restaurant in the development stage, which  opened for business on December 27, 2012 using our limited partnership ownership model. We continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business. Any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model.   We are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores, but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available, we will consider it.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   We fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations. As of September 29, 2012, we had cash of approximately $7,221,000, an increase of $2,957,000 from our cash balance of $4,264,000 as of October 1, 2011. The increase in cash as of September 29, 2012 was primarily due to a balance of $1,306,000 of net proceeds from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami, Florida restaurant and opened for business on December 27, 2012. Management believes that the Company’s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.     39     Table of Contents      Cash Flows               Fiscal Years               2012         2011               (in thousands)       Net cash and cash equivalents                             provided by operating activities       $ 6,212         $ 4,352       Net cash and cash equivalents                             used in investing activities         (2,030 )         (4,172 )     Net cash and cash equivalents                             used in financing activities         (1,225 )         (2,363 )     Net increase (decrease)                             in cash and equivalents         2,957           (2,183 )     Cash and equivalents,                             beginning of year         4,264           6,447       Cash and equivalents,                             end of year       $ 7,221         $ 4,264     Capital Expenditures   In addition to using cash for our operating expenses, we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. We acquired property and equipment of $7,800,000, (including $6,100,000 of which was financed and $30,000 of deposits recorded in other assets as of October 1, 2011), during our fiscal year 2012, including $507,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant and three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2011, we acquired property and equipment of $4,586,000, (including $122,000 of which was financed and $28,000 of deposits recorded in other assets as of October 1, 2010), during our fiscal year 2011, including $1,261,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant. All of our owned units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive. The cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year 2012 was $507,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant and for renovations to three (3) limited partnership owned restaurants. We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year 2013 will be approximately $850,000, which funds will be provided from operations.     40     Table of Contents      Debt   As of the end of our fiscal year 2012, we had debt of $13,418,000, as compared to $8,757,000 as of the end of our fiscal year 2011. As of September 29, 2012, we are in compliance with the covenants of all loans with our lender.   We repaid long term debt, including auto loans, financed insurance premiums and mortgages in the amount of $1,859,000 and $1,350,000 in our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively.   Financed Insurance Premiums    (i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2010, our property insurance is a three (3) year policy with our insurance carrier. The three (3) year property insurance premium is in the amount of $894,000, of which $727,000 is financed through an unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement provides that we are obligated to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 4.89% per annum, over 30 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of approximately $25,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.   (ii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2011, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including automobile and excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $286,000, of which $250,000 was financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligated us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 3.19% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $25,000. The finance agreement was secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.   (iii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2011, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $356,000, of which $297,000 was financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligated us to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 3.19% per annum, over 9 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $30,000 and was paid in full during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2012. The finance agreement was secured by a security agreement in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.   (iv) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2012, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including automobile and excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $309,000, of which $282,000 is financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 3.29% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $29,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.     41     Table of Contents        (v) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2012, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $390,000, of which $356,000 is financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 3.29% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $36,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security agreement in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.   As of September 29, 2012, the aggregate principal balance owed from the financing of our property and general liability insurance policies is $333,000.   Purchase Commitments    In order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants, on September 19, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with a new rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $3,800,000 of baby back ribs during calendar year 2013 from this vendor at a fixed cost. While we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.   Purchase of Limited Partnership Interests   During our fiscal year 2012, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 0.18% in one (1) limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000. During our fiscal year 2011, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 1.06% in one (1) limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of $17,000.   Working capital   The table below summarizes our current assets, current liabilities and working capital for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011:       42     Table of Contents                  Sept. 29         Oct. 1       (in thousands)       2012         2011                                 Current assets       $ 11,433         $ 8,293                                     Current liabilities         8,283           6,473                                     Working capital         3,150           1,820     Our working capital as of September 29, 2012 increased by 73.13% from working capital as of October 1, 2011. Our working capital increased during our fiscal year 2012 from our working capital for our fiscal year ended October 1, 2011 primarily due to the net funds ($1,306,000) remaining from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami, Florida restaurant.   While there can be no assurance due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year 2013, including payment for a new point of sale system for our restaurants ($415,000).   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year 2012 or our fiscal year 2011.   Critical Accounting Policies   Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:   Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment   The estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.       43     Table of Contents      Consolidation of Limited Partnerships   As of September 29, 2012, we operate eight (8) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami, Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner. This new restaurant  opened for business on December 27, 2012. Additionally, we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening additional new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from 5% to 48% of the total units outstanding. As a result of these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of 50% of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The  noncontrolling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.   Income Taxes    FASB ASC Topic 740 – Income Taxes , requires, among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2012.   Other Matters    Impact of Inflation   The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results, but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise.       44     Table of Contents      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   As part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 9 “Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks. These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations.   At September 29, 2012, we had four variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates. In July, 2010, we converted the amount outstanding on our line of credit ($1,586,000) to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) and we also re-financed the mortgage loan encumbering our corporate offices (the “Refinanced Mortgage Loan”). In November, 2011, we financed our purchase of the real property and two building shopping center in Miami, Florida, with a $4,500,000 mortgage loan (the “$4.5M Mortgage Loan”), and received a $1,600,000 term loan (the “$1.6M Term Loan”) the proceeds of which were ultimately used to purchase the shopping center, while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with our unrelated third party lender to convert these variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. We are currently party to the following four (4) interest rate swap agreements:   (i) One (1) interest rate swap agreement entered into in July, 2010 relates to the Term Loan, (the “Term Loan Swap”), which converts the LIBOR based variable rate interest to a fixed rate. The Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a three (3) year period at a fixed rate of 4.55% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $1,586,000, while receiving interest for the same period at the British Bankers Association LIBOR (“LIBOR”), Daily Floating Rate, plus 3.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. Under this method of accounting, at September 29, 2012, we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender, t he fair value of the Term Loan Swap was not significant; and   (ii) The second interest rate swap agreement entered into July, 2010 relates to the Refinanced Mortgage Loan (the “Mortgage Loan Swap”). The Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a seven (7) year period at a fixed rate of 5.11% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $935,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR, Daily Floating Rate, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. Under this method of accounting, at September 29, 2012, we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender, t he fair value of the Mortgage Loan Swap was not significant; and   (iii) The third interest rate swap agreement entered into in November, 2011 by our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan’s Calusa Center, LLC, relates to the $4.5 Mortgage Loan (the “$4.5M Mortgage Loan Swap”). The $4.5M Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for an eight (8) year period at a fixed rate of 4.51% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $3,750,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR – 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at September 29, 2012, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material; and       45     Table of Contents      (iv) The fourth interest rate swap agreement entered into in November, 2011 relates to the $1.6M Term Loan (the “$1.6M Term Loan Swap”). The $1.6M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a four (4) year period at a fixed rate of 3.43% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $1,600,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR – 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at September 29, 2012, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material. At September 29, 2012, our cash resources earn interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. There is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.   		</c>

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 28 ITEM 7.                MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.  It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. Industry Conditions. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market.  As such, financial results tend to fluctuate with periods of constrained availability, high rates and strong profits followed by periods of abundant capacity, low rates and constrained profitability.  Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor’s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written.  Furthermore, the market impact from these competitive factors related to reinsurance and insurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels. We compete in the U.S. and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors.  Our competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd’s.  Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and have established long term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage.  In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. Worldwide insurance and reinsurance market conditions continued to be very competitive, particularly in the casualty lines of business.  Generally, there was ample insurance and reinsurance capacity relative to demand.  Competition and its effect on rates, terms and conditions vary widely by market and coverage yet continued to be most prevalent in the U.S. casualty insurance and reinsurance markets. However, during 2011, the industry experienced significant losses from Australian floods, the New Zealand earthquake, the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, storms in the U.S, and the Thailand floods.  It is too early to determine the impact on market conditions as a result of these events.  While there have been meaningful rate increases for catastrophe coverages in some global catastrophe prone regions, particularly areas impacted by these losses, whether the magnitude of these losses is sufficient to increase rates and improve market conditions for other lines of business remains to be seen. Overall, we believe that current marketplace conditions, particularly for catastrophe coverages, provide profit opportunities for us given our strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise.  We continue to employ our strategy of targeting business that offers the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in our overall portfolio.    14 Table of Contents Financial Summary. We monitor and evaluate our overall performance based upon financial results.  The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income (loss), ratios and stockholder’s equity for the periods indicated:      Years Ended December 31,   Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions)   2011   2010   2009     2011/2010     2010/2009 Gross written premiums   $ 3,558.5     $ 3,467.8     $ 3,334.1       2.6 %     4.0 % Net written premiums     1,754.0       1,788.7       1,735.3       -1.9 %     3.1 %                                            REVENUES:                                         Premiums earned   $ 1,793.9     $ 1,813.8     $ 1,785.1       -1.1 %     1.6 % Net investment income     312.9       350.3       262.1       -10.7 %     33.7 % Net realized capital gains (losses)     (41.1 )     65.3       56.9       -163.0 %     14.7 % Realized gain on debt repurchase     -       -       78.3       0.0 %     -100.0 % Other income (expense)     (11.7 )     12.1       0.4       -197.3 %   NM   Total revenues     2,053.9       2,241.5       2,182.7       -8.4 %     2.7 %                                            CLAIMS AND EXPENSES:                                         Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses     1,877.6       1,477.5       1,091.7       27.1 %     35.3 % Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees     338.7       335.1       344.6       1.1 %     -2.8 % Other underwriting expenses     154.3       139.8       142.6       10.4 %     -1.9 % Corporate expense     6.1       5.9       7.7       3.5 %     -24.0 % Interest, fee and bond issue cost amortization expense     50.8       54.6       70.9       -6.9 %     -23.0 % Total claims and expenses     2,427.4       2,012.8       1,657.5       20.6 %     21.4 %                                            INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES     (373.5 )     228.8       525.2     NM       -56.4 % Income tax expense (benefit)     (170.7 )     (36.6 )     129.4     NM       -128.3 % NET INCOME (LOSS)   $ (202.8 )   $ 265.4     $ 395.9       -176.4 %     -33.0 %                                            RATIOS:                           Point Change Loss ratio     104.7 %     81.5 %     61.2 %     23.2       20.3   Commission and brokerage ratio     18.9 %     18.5 %     19.3 %     0.4       (0.8 ) Other underwriting expense ratio     8.6 %     7.6 %     7.9 %     1.0       (0.3 ) Combined ratio     132.2 %     107.6 %     88.4 %     24.6       19.2                                                                                              At December 31,   Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in millions)     2011     2010     2009     2011/2010     2010/2009 Balance sheet data:                                         Total investments and cash   $ 8,396.3     $ 8,293.9     $ 8,031.6       1.2 %     3.3 % Total assets     14,349.2       13,845.7       13,349.1       3.7 %     3.7 % Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves     8,290.6       7,652.3       7,300.1       8.3 %     4.8 % Total debt     818.1       868.1       1,018.0       -5.8 %     -14.7 % Total liabilities     11,407.8       10,717.9       10,490.3       6.6 %     2.2 % Stockholder's equity     2,941.4       3,127.7       2,858.8       -6.0 %     9.4 %                                            (NM, not meaningful)                                         (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding)                                         Revenues. Premiums.   Gross written premiums increased by $90.8 million, or 2.6%, in 2011 compared to 2010, reflecting a $103.7 million increase in our insurance business, partially offset by a $12.9 million decrease in our reinsurance business.  The year over year increase in insurance premiums was primarily due to the acquisition of Heartland, which provided $169.6 million of new crop insurance business, our recent initiative in primary medical stop loss insurance, which added $54.0 million of premium and improved premium rates on our California workers’ compensation business, partially offset by our reduced participation on a large casualty program.  The decrease in reinsurance premiums was due to the continued reduction in U.S. casualty business, the loss of several large crop reinsurance contracts, as well as the planned reduction of catastrophe exposed business in certain territories, partially offset by higher reinstatement premiums, $24.5 million resulting from catastrophe losses and favorable foreign exchange impact, year over year, of $33.4       15 Table of Contents   million.  Net written premiums decreased by $34.7 million, or 1.9%, in 2011 compared to 2010.  The fluctuations in net written premiums relative to the change in gross written premiums were due to a combination of a higher percentage of premiums ceded under the affiliated quota share agreement and a lower level of ceded reinsurance in the Insurance segment due to the planned reduction in one casualty program.  Premiums earned decreased $20.0 million, or 1.1%, in 2011 compared to 2010.  The change in net premiums earned is relatively consistent with the decline in net written premiums. Gross written premiums increased by $133.6 million, or 4.0%, in 2010 compared to 2009, reflecting an increase of $110.8 million in our reinsurance business and $22.8 million increase in our insurance business.  The increase in reinsurance premiums was primarily the result of increased writings in our U.S. treaty property and international books of business, driven by a combination of new business, increased participations on renewal contracts, rate increases in select areas and economic and insurance growth in several regions.  The increase in insurance premiums was due to increased writings in professional liability and California workers’ compensation business, partially offset by a reduction in the audit premium accrual for workers’ compensation business.  Net written premiums increased by $53.4 million, or 3.1%, in 2010 compared to 2009.  The fluctuations in net written premiums in comparison to the fluctuations in gross written premiums were primarily attributable to fluctuations in cessions under the affiliated quota share agreement.  Premiums earned increased $28.8 million, or 1.6%, in 2010 compared to 2009.  The change in net premiums earned is relatively consistent with the increase in net written premiums. Net Investment Income.   Net investment income decreased $37.4 million, or 10.7%, to $312.9 million in 2011 compared with net investment income of $350.3 million in 2010, primarily due to a $58.2 million decline in income from our fixed maturities, reflective of reducing our municipal bond exposures and declining reinvestment rates.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $19.5 million in income from equities due to our expanded public equity portfolio and emerging market debt mutual funds.  Net pre-tax investment income, as a percentage of average invested assets, was 3.9% in 2011 compared to 4.4% in 2010.  The variance in this yield was primarily the result of fluctuations in our limited partnership income. Net investment income increased $88.3 million, or 33.7%, to $350.3 million in 2010, compared with net investment income of $262.1 million in 2009, primarily as a result of a $73.9 million increase in investment income from our limited partnerships.  Net pre-tax investment income, as a percentage of average invested assets, was 4.4% in 2010, compared to 3.4% for 2009. Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).   Net realized capital losses were $41.1 million and net realized capital gains were $65.3 million and $56.9 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Of the $41.1 million, there were $16.7 million of losses from fair value re-measurements, $14.5 million of other-than-temporary impairments on our available for sale fixed maturity securities and $9.9 million of net realized capital losses from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities.  The net realized capital gains of $65.3 million in 2010 were the result of $93.8 million of gains of fair value re-measurements, partially offset by $26.4 million of net realized capital losses from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities and $2.1 million of other-than-temporary impairments.  The net realized capital gains of $56.9 million in 2009 were the result of $80.3 million of gains in fair value re-measurements, partially offset by $17.9 million of net realized capital losses from sales on our fixed maturity and equity securities and $5.5 million in other-than-temporary impairments on our available for sale fixed maturity securities. Realized Gain on Debt Repurchase.   On March 19, 2009, we commenced a cash tender offer for any and all of the 6.60% fixed to floating rate long term subordinated notes due 2067. Upon expiration of the tender offer, we had reduced our outstanding debt by $161.4 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on debt repurchase of $78.3 million. Other Income (Expense).   We recorded other expense of $11.7 million in 2011 and other income of $12.1 million and $0.4 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The changes were primarily due to fluctuations in the amortization of deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance agreements with affiliates and fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the corresponding periods.    16 Table of Contents   Claims and Expenses.

Incurred losses and LAE increased by $385.8 million, or 35.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  Of the $385.8 million increase, current year catastrophe losses increased $248.4 million (13.7 points), period over period, primarily due to losses on the Chilean earthquake, New Zealand earthquake, Australian hailstorms and floods, and the Canadian hailstorm. The current year attritional losses also increased $144.5 million (7.1 points) reflecting higher expected loss ratios on current year business due to prevailing market conditions. Partially offsetting these higher current year losses was a decrease of $7.2 million, or 0.4 points, in prior year loss development as the 2010 reserve studies indicated net favorable reserve development and loss estimates for prior year catastrophes were reduced.    17 Table of Contents   Commission, Brokerage, Taxes and Fees.   Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $3.6 million, or 1.1%, in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010.  The variance was primarily the result of fluctuations in the mix of business and a change in the affiliated quota share agreement. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $9.5 million, or 2.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.  The change was primarily the result of the mix of business and lower contingent commissions. Other Underwriting Expenses.   Other underwriting expenses were $154.3 million, $139.8 million and $142.6 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The increase in other underwriting expenses for 2011 compared to 2010 was mainly due to expenses of Heartland, which was acquired in January, 2011.  The expenses for 2010 and 2009 were comparable. Corporate Expenses.   Corporate expenses, which are general operating expenses that are not allocated to segments, were $6.1 million, $5.9 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  These expenses were previously included as underwriting expenses and therefore included in the other underwriting expense ratio.  Effective January 1, 2010, these expenses were removed from the calculation of the other underwriting expense ratio and prior periods were recalculated to conform. Interest, Fees and Bond Issue Cost Amortization Expense. Interest, fees and other bond amortization expense was $50.8 million and $54.6 million and $70.9 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The decrease from 2009 was primarily due to the maturing of debt in March, 2010. Income Tax Expense (Benefit).   We had an income tax benefit of $170.7 million and $36.6 million in 2011 and 2010, and an income tax expense of $129.4 million in 2009.  Our income tax is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates coupled with the impact from tax-preferenced investment income.  Variations in our effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income.  The decrease in tax year over year was primarily attributable to the impact on taxable income from the previously mentioned catastrophe losses. Net Income (Loss). Our net loss was $202.8 million in 2011 compared to a net income of $265.4 million in 2010.  The variance was primarily driven by higher catastrophe losses in 2011 in addition to the other components discussed above. Our net income was $265.4 million and $395.9 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The decrease was primarily driven by a few large catastrophe losses in 2010 compared to no similar catastrophe events in 2009 and the realized gain on debt repurchase in 2009, partially offset by an increase in net realized capital gains and a reduction in income taxes. Ratios. Our combined ratio increased by 24.6 points to 132.2% in 2011 compared to 107.6% in 2010.  The loss ratio component increased by 23.2 points in 2011, over the same period last year, principally due to higher current year catastrophe losses as a result of the Japan earthquake, New Zealand earthquake, Thailand floods, U.S. storms and the Australia floods.    The commission and brokerage expense ratio increased slightly to 18.9% in 2011 compared to 18.5% in 2010.  The other underwriting expense ratio component increased to 8.6% in 2011 compared to 7.6% in 2010 due primarily to the acquisition of Heartland.    18 Table of Contents   Our combined ratio increased by 19.2 points to 107.6% in 2010 compared to 88.4% in 2009.  The loss ratio component increased 20.3 points in 2010 compared to 2009, principally due to the increase in current year catastrophe losses as a result of the Chilean earthquake, Australian hailstorms and floods, New Zealand earthquake and the Canadian hailstorm.   Both the other underwriting expense ratio component and the commission and brokerage ratio component declined slightly compared to 2009. Stockholder's Equity. Stockholder's equity decreased by $186.3 million to $2,941.4 million at December 31, 2011 from $3,127.7 million at December 31, 2010, principally as a result of $202.8 million of net loss, $29.5 million of net benefit plan obligation adjustments and $0.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by $41.1 million of unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax, and $6.4 million of share-based compensation transactions. Stockholder's equity increased by $269.0 million to $3,127.7 million at December 31, 2010 from $2,858.8 million at December 31, 2009, principally as a result of $265.4 million of net income, $27.0 million of foreign currency translation adjustments and $6.6 million of share-based compensation transactions, partially offset by $28.2 million of unrealized depreciation on investments, net of tax, and $1.8 million of pension adjustments. Consolidated Investment Results Net Investment Income. Net investment income decreased 10.7% to $312.9 million in 2011 compared to $350.3 million in 2010, primarily due to a $58.2 million decline in income from our fixed maturities, reflective of reducing our municipal bond exposures and declining reinvestment rates.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $19.5 million in income from equities due to our expanded public equity portfolio and emerging market debt mutual funds. Net investment income increased 33.7% to $350.3 million in 2010 compared to $262.1 million in 2009.  The increase, period over period, was primarily due to an increase in recorded gains from our limited partnership investments and an increase in dividend income from owning more shares of our parent’s common shares. The following table shows the components of net investment income for the periods indicated:      Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions)   2011   2010   2009 Fixed maturities   $ 232.3     $ 290.5     $ 286.0   Equity securities     29.7       10.2       3.6   Short-term investments and cash     1.1       0.4       3.5   Other invested assets                         Limited partnerships     42.3       45.5       (28.5 ) Dividends from Parent's shares     18.6       14.0       8.0   Other     2.7       1.3       0.1   Total gross investment income     326.8       361.8       272.7   Interest debited (credited) and other expense     (13.9 )     (11.5 )     (10.6 ) Total net investment income   $ 312.9     $ 350.3     $ 262.1   (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding)                            19 Table of Contents   The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated:    2011 2010 2009 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 3.6% 3.6% 3.7% Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 2.7% 2.8% 3.1%             Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 3.9% 4.4% 3.4% Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 3.0% 3.5% 2.9% Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).

Segment Results. During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we realigned our reporting segments to reflect recent changes in the type and volume of business written. We previously reported the results of Marine & Aviation, Surety, A&H Reinsurance and A&H Primary operations as a separate segment—Specialty Underwriting.  The A&H primary business, which is a relatively new line of business for us, has increased significantly, representing approximately 2% of premiums earned and is projected to continue to grow.  The A&H primary business is better aligned with the Insurance reporting segment based on the similarities of this business with those businesses already reflected in the Insurance segment.  The other operating units included in the Specialty Underwriting segment would have encompassed less than 5% of our premiums earned and their volume is projected to remain approximately 6%.  As a result of the size of these remaining operating units and their similarity to the business reported within U.S. Reinsurance, they have been reclassified to the U.S. Reinsurance segment.  There has been no change to the International reporting segment.  We have restated all segment information for prior years to conform to the new reporting segment structure. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty reinsurance and specialty lines of business, including Marine, Aviation, Surety and A&H business, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies primarily within the U.S.  The Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance, including medical stop loss insurance, directly and through general agents, brokers and surplus lines brokers within the U.S.  The International operation writes non-U.S. property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re’s branches in Singapore and Canada and through offices in Brazil, Miami and New Jersey. These segments are managed independently, but conform with corporate guidelines with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate catastrophe exposures, capital, investments and support operations.  Management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses.  We measure our underwriting results using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by premiums earned. Our loss and LAE reserves are our best estimate of our ultimate liability for unpaid claims.  We re-evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including all prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss claim experience and trends related to prior periods.  Such re-evaluations are recorded in incurred losses in the period in which the re-evaluation is made.    21 Table of Contents   The following discusses the underwriting results for each of our segments for the periods indicated: U.S. Reinsurance.

Gross written premiums decreased by 0.8% to $1,395.4 million in 2010 from $1,407.1 million in 2009, primarily due to a $40.7 million (48.2%) decrease in the crop hail quota share treaties, a $32.4 million (8.9%) decrease in U.S. treaty casualty volume and a $28.6 million (29.2%) decrease in facultative volume, partially offset by a $73.7 million (11.8%) increase in treaty property volume. Net written premiums decreased 2.5% to $773.6 million in 2010 compared to $793.5 million for 2009, primarily due to the decrease in gross written premiums.  Premiums earned decreased 4.6% to $777.7 million in 2010 compared to $815.6 million in 2009, primarily due to the decline in net written premiums.    22 Table of Contents Incurred Losses and LAE.   The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the U.S. Reinsurance segment for the periods indicated.      Years Ended December 31,      Current   Ratio %/   Prior   Ratio %/   Total   Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions)   Year   Pt Change   Years   Pt Change   Incurred   Pt Change 2011                                              Attritional   $ 399.5       57.2 %      $ 37.4       5.4 %      $ 436.9       62.6 %    Catastrophes     176.6       25.3 %        9.6       1.4 %        186.2       26.7 %    A&E     -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %    Total segment   $ 576.1       82.5 %      $ 47.0       6.8 %      $ 623.1       89.3 %                                                                2010                                                          Attritional   $ 469.5       60.4 %      $ 63.3       8.1 %      $ 532.8       68.5 %    Catastrophes     17.5       2.3 %        6.2       0.8 %        23.7       3.1 %    A&E     -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %    Total segment   $ 487.0       62.7 %      $ 69.5       8.9 %      $ 556.5       71.6 %                                                                2009                                                          Attritional   $ 411.4       50.3 %      $ 29.2       3.6 %      $ 440.6       53.9 %    Catastrophes     -       0.0 %        (0.3 )     0.0 %        (0.3 )     0.0 %    A&E     -       0.0 %        0.4       0.1 %        0.4       0.1 %    Total segment   $ 411.4       50.3 %      $ 29.3       3.7 %      $ 440.7       54.0 %                                                                Variance 2011/2010                                                          Attritional   $ (70.0 )     (3.2 ) pts   $ (25.9 )     (2.7 ) pts   $ (95.9 )     (5.9 ) pts Catastrophes     159.1       23.0   pts     3.4       0.6   pts     162.5       23.6   pts A&E     -       -   pts     -       -   pts     -       -   pts Total segment   $ 89.1       19.8   pts   $ (22.5 )     (2.1 ) pts   $ 66.6       17.7   pts                                                             Variance 2010/2009                                                          Attritional   $ 58.1       10.1   pts   $ 34.1       4.5   pts   $ 92.2       14.6   pts Catastrophes     17.5       2.3   pts     6.5       0.8   pts     24.0       3.1   pts A&E     -       -   pts     (0.4 )     (0.1 ) pts     (0.4 )     (0.1 ) pts Total segment   $ 75.6       12.4   pts   $ 40.2       5.2   pts   $ 115.8       17.6   pts                                                             (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)                                                    Incurred losses were $66.6 million (17.7 points) higher at $623.1 million in 2011 compared to $556.5 million in 2010, primarily as a result of the $159.1 million (23.0 points) increase in current year catastrophe losses, largely due to the Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, U.S. Midwest tornadoes, Hurricane Irene and Thailand floods.  Partially offsetting this increase, the current year attritional losses decreased $70.0 million (3.2 points), primarily due to a shift in the mix of business, with a higher level of excess of loss business in the current year, which carries a lower attritional loss ratio, than pro rata business as well as the decline in earned premiums. Incurred losses were $115.8 million (17.6 points) higher at $556.5 million in 2010 compared to $440.7 million in 2009, primarily as a result of the $58.1 million (10.1 points) increase in current year attritional losses, reflective of current competitive market conditions, $34.1 million (4.5 points) increase in prior year attritional losses and a $24.0 million (3.1 points) increase in catastrophe losses, due to the New Zealand and Chilean earthquakes.  The increase in prior years’ attritional losses was primarily driven by reserve strengthening in casualty lines for construction liability claims. Segment Expenses.   Commission and brokerage expenses decreased 7.9% to $156.0 million in 2011 compared to $169.3 million in 2010.  This decrease was primarily due to the decline in premiums earned.  Segment other underwriting expenses decreased to $39.3 million in 2011 compared to $42.5 million for the same period in 2010.  This decline was due to reduced operating costs for the segment.    23 Table of Contents   Commission and brokerage expenses decreased 7.5% to $169.3 million in 2010 compared to $183.1 million in 2009, primarily due to the decline in premiums earned.  Segment other underwriting expenses in 2010 decreased slightly to $42.5 million from $44.9 million in 2009.

Gross written premiums increased by 2.7% to $865.4 million in 2010 compared to $842.6 million in 2009. This was primarily due to increased writings in A&H primary, professional liability and California workers’ compensation business, partially offset by a reduction in audit premiums for workers’ compensation business.  Net written premiums increased 6.2% to $373.7 million in 2010 compared to $352.1 million in 2009, primarily due to the increase in gross written premiums.  Premiums earned increased 7.1% to $409.8 million in 2010 compared to $382.8 million in 2009.  The change in premiums earned is relatively consistent with the increase in net written premium.    24 Table of Contents   Incurred Losses and LAE.   The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the Insurance segment for the periods indicated.      Years Ended December 31,      Current Ratio %/   Prior   Ratio %/   Total   Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions)   Year Pt Change   Years   Pt Change   Incurred   Pt Change 2011                                              Attritional   $ 371.7       80.9 %      $ 24.7       5.4 %      $ 396.4       86.3 %    Catastrophes     1.8       0.4 %        0.2       0.0 %        2.0       0.4 %    Total segment   $ 373.5       81.3 %      $ 24.9       5.4 %      $ 398.4       86.7 %                                                                2010                                                          Attritional   $ 329.2       80.3 %      $ 29.9       7.3 %      $ 359.0       87.6 %    Catastrophes     -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %    Total segment   $ 329.2       80.3 %      $ 29.9       7.3 %      $ 359.0       87.6 %                                                                2009                                                          Attritional   $ 291.8       76.2 %      $ 26.0       6.8 %      $ 317.8       83.0 %    Catastrophes     -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %        -       0.0 %    Total segment   $ 291.8       76.2 %      $ 26.0       6.8 %      $ 317.8       83.0 %                                                                Variance 2011/2010                                                          Attritional   $ 42.5       0.6   pts   $ (5.2 )     (1.9 ) pts   $ 37.3       (1.3 ) pts Catastrophes     1.8       0.4   pts     0.2       -   pts     2.0       0.4   pts Total segment   $ 44.3       1.0   pts   $ (5.0 )     (1.9 ) pts   $ 39.3       (0.9 ) pts                                                             Variance 2010/2009                                                          Attritional   $ 37.4       4.1   pts   $ 3.9       0.5   pts   $ 41.2       4.6   pts Catastrophes     -       -   pts     -       -   pts     -       -   pts Total segment   $ 37.4       4.1   pts   $ 3.9       0.5   pts   $ 41.2       4.6   pts                                                             (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)                                                    Incurred losses and LAE increased by $39.3 million, or 10.9%, to $398.4 million in 2011 compared to $359.0 million in 2010.  This increase was primarily due to an increase of $42.5 million (0.6 points) in current year attritional losses primarily due to higher net premiums earned.  The $24.7 million of prior years’ development was primarily attributable to excess casualty and California workers’ compensation reserves. Incurred losses and LAE increased by 13.0% to $359.0 million in 2010 compared to $317.8 million in 2009.  The increase was primarily due to the $37.4 million increase in current years’ attritional losses, primarily due to higher expected loss ratios on several programs, reflective of current market conditions.  The 2010 prior years’ unfavorable development of $29.9 million was primarily the result of reserve strengthening on several terminated programs. Segment Expenses.   Commission and brokerage expenses increased to $40.4 million in 2011 compared to $29.6 million in 2010.  These increases were primarily the result of an increase in net premiums earned and changes in distribution, mix of business and ceded reinsurance.  Segment other underwriting expenses in 2011 increased to $87.7 million from $69.7 million in 2010.  These increases were primarily due to the expenses of the newly acquired Heartland. Commission and brokerage expenses decreased slightly to $29.6 million in 2010 from $29.8 million in 2009. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of variations in reinsurance ceded, particularly under the affiliated quota share agreement.  Segment other underwriting expenses in 2010 decreased to $69.7 million from $74.6 million in 2009.  The decrease is the result of management’s direct actions to reduce expenses.    25 Table of Contents   International.

Gross written premiums increased by 11.3% to $1,207.0 million in 2010 compared to $1,084.5 million in 2009, due to continued strong growth in premiums written through the Brazil, Miami and New Jersey offices, a $42.7 million increase; Asia, a $55.7 million increase; and Canada, a $24.2 million increase; resulting from a combination of new business, rate increases in select areas, and economic and insurance growth in some markets.  Also contributing to the increase was $16.0 million in reinstatement premiums from the Chilean earthquake and Calgary hailstorm.  Net written premiums increased by 8.8% to $641.4 million in 2010 compared to $589.7 million in 2009, principally as a result of the increase in gross written premiums.  Premiums earned increased by 6.7% to $626.3 million in 2010 compared to $586.7 million in 2009 consistent with the trend noted for net written premiums.    26 Table of Contents   Incurred Losses and LAE.   The following table presents the incurred losses and LAE for the International segment for the periods indicated.      Years Ended December 31,      Current     Ratio %/   Prior     Ratio %/   Total     Ratio %/ (Dollars in millions)   Year     Pt Change   Years     Pt Change   Incurred     Pt Change 2 011                                              Attritional   $ 302.8       47.6 %      $ (56.8 )     -8.9 %      $ 246.0       38.7 %    Catastrophes     610.5       95.9 %        (0.3 )     -0.1 %        610.2       95.8 %    Total segment   $ 913.3       143.5 %      $ (57.1 )     -9.0 %      $ 856.1       134.5 %                                                                2010                                                          Attritional   $ 345.4       55.1 %      $ (26.9 )     -4.3 %      $ 318.5       50.8 %    Catastrophes     253.0       40.4 %        (9.6 )     -1.5 %        243.4       38.9 %    Total segment   $ 598.4       95.5 %      $ (36.5 )     -5.8 %      $ 561.9       89.7 %                                                                2009                                                          Attritional   $ 296.4       50.5 %      $ 12.5       2.1 %      $ 309.0       52.7 %    Catastrophes     22.1       3.8 %        2.1       0.4 %        24.2       4.1 %    Total segment   $ 318.5       54.3 %      $ 14.7       2.5 %      $ 333.2       56.8 %                                                                Variance 2011/2010                                                          Attritional   $ (42.6 )     (7.5 ) pts   $ (29.9 )     (4.6 ) pts   $ (72.5 )     (12.1 ) pts Catastrophes     357.5       55.5   pts     9.3       1.4   pts     366.8       56.9   pts Total segment   $ 314.9       48.0   pts   $ (20.6 )     (3.2 ) pts   $ 294.2       44.8   pts                                                             Variance 2010/2009                                                          Attritional   $ 49.0       4.6   pts   $ (39.4 )     (6.4 ) pts   $ 9.5       (1.9 ) pts Catastrophes     230.9       36.6   pts     (11.7 )     (1.9 ) pts     219.2       34.8   pts Total segment   $ 279.9       41.2   pts   $ (51.2 )     (8.3 ) pts   $ 228.7       32.9   pts                                                             (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.)                                                    Incurred losses and LAE increased 52.4% to $856.1 million in 2011 compared to $561.9 million in 2010.  The increase was principally due to a $357.5 million (55.5 points) increase in current year catastrophes (Japan and New Zealand earthquakes, the Thailand and Australia floods, the wildfire loss in Alberta, Canada and Hurricane Irene), compared to the 2010 reported catastrophe losses (Chile earthquake and Australia hailstorms).  The current year attritional loss ratio decreased to 47.6% in 2011 from 55.1% in 2010, primarily due to a shift in the mix of business towards property, catastrophe and excess of loss business, which generally carries a lower loss ratio. Prior years’ attritional losses decreased by $29.9 million (4.6 points) due to favorable development on non-catastrophe property business in Singapore and other international markets. Incurred losses and LAE increased 68.6% to $561.9 million in 2010 compared to $333.2 million in 2009.  The increase was principally due to a $230.9 million (36.6 points) increase in current year catastrophes related to the Chilean earthquake, the Australian hailstorms and floods, the New Zealand earthquake, and the Canadian hailstorm compared to the absence in 2009 of any similar large events.  Attritional losses also increased primarily due to the increased premiums earned and higher expected loss ratios, which were partially offset by favorable development of prior years’ attritional reserves. Segment Expenses.   Commission and brokerage expenses increased 4.5% to $142.3 million in 2011 compared to $136.2 million in 2010.  These variances were due to the changes in premiums and the mix of business.  Segment other underwriting expenses decreased slightly to $27.3 million in 2011 compared to $27.6 million in 2010. Commission and brokerage expenses increased 3.4% to $136.2 million in 2010 compared to $131.7 million in 2009. The increase was primarily in line with the increases in premiums earned.  Segment other underwriting expenses in 2010 were $27.6 million compared to $23.1 million in 2009.  The increase was consistent with the growth in premiums earned resulting in stable other underwriting expense ratios for the periods.    27 Table of Contents SAFE HARBOR DISCLOSURE This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.  We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the federal securities laws.  In some cases, these statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “plan”, “believe”, “predict”, “potential” and “intend”.  Forward-looking statements contained in this report include information regarding our reserves for losses and LAE, the adequacy of our provision for uncollectible balances, estimates of our catastrophe exposure, the effects of catastrophic events on our financial statements and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends.  Forward-looking statements only reflect our expectations and are not guarantees of performance.  These statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  Actual events or results may differ materially from our expectations.  Important factors that could cause our actual events or results to be materially different from our expectations include those discussed under the caption ITEM 1A, “Risk Factors”.  We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A.                       QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market Sensitive Instruments. The SEC’s Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, “market sensitive instruments”).  We do not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Our current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.  Our mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted periodically, consistent with our current and projected operating results, market conditions and our tax position.  The fixed maturity securities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities.  Additionally, we have invested in equity securities. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations.  In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with our capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis.  This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which our investments provide liquidity.  This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality.  The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. Interest Rate Risk.   Our $8.4 billion investment portfolio, at December 31, 2011, is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and some foreign currency exchange rate risk, and some equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations and some foreign exchange rate risk.  The overall economic impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is partially mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity securities portfolio, including short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates.  In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $615.6 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $5,220.6 million fixed maturity portfolio.  Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security.    28 Table of Contents   The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on our fixed maturity portfolio (including $423.7 million of short-term investments) for the periods indicated based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest rates.  For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually.  To generate appropriate price estimates for mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account.  For legal entities with non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios.      Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points      At December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions)     -200     -100     0     100     200 Total Market/Fair Value   $ 5,913.2     $ 5,782.7     $ 5,644.3     $ 5,490.5     $ 5,327.6   Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%)     4.8 %     2.5 %     0.0 %     -2.7 %     -5.6 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation                                         After-tax from Base ($)   $ 174.8     $ 90.0     $ -     $ (100.0 )   $ (205.9 )      Impact of Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points      At December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions)     -200     -100     0     100     200 Total Market/Fair Value   $ 6,769.2     $ 6,546.0     $ 6,297.3     $ 6,032.8     $ 5,778.3   Market/Fair Value Change from Base (%)     7.5 %     3.9 %     0.0 %     -4.2 %     -8.2 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation                                         After-tax from Base ($)   $ 306.7     $ 161.7     $ -     $ (171.9 )   $ (337.4 ) We had $8,290.6 million and $7,652.3 million of gross reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to present value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money.  Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the present value of the reserves is less than the nominal value.  As interest rates rise, the present value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the present value increases.  These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments.  While the difference between present value and nominal value is not reflected in our financial statements, our financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid.  Our loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration that is reasonably consistent with our fixed income portfolio. Equity Risk.   Equity risk is the potential change in fair and/or market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing prices.  Our equity investments consist of a diversified portfolio of individual securities and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on major exchanges.  The primary objective of the equity portfolio is to obtain greater total return relative to bonds over time through market appreciation and income.    29 Table of Contents   The tables below display the impact on fair/market value and after-tax change in fair/market value of a 10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down for the periods indicated.      Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values      At December 31, 2011 (Dollars in millions)     -20 %     -10 %     0 %     10 %     20 % Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio   $ 965.7     $ 1,086.4     $ 1,207.1     $ 1,327.8     $ 1,448.5   After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value     (156.9 )     (78.5 )     -       78.5       156.9        Impact of Percentage Change in Equity Fair/Market Values      At December 31, 2010 (Dollars in millions)     -20 %     -10 %     0 %     10 %     20 % Fair/Market Value of the Equity Portfolio   $ 546.8     $ 615.1     $ 683.5     $ 751.8     $ 820.2   After-tax Change in Fair/Market Value     (88.9 )     (44.4 )     -       44.4       88.9   Foreign Exchange Risk.   Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Each of our non-U.S. (“foreign”) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines.  Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates.  The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Singapore and Canadian Dollars, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro.  We mitigate foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of our assets to our corresponding operating liabilities.  In accordance with FASB guidance, we translate the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar.  This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure for the periods indicated.  This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency.      Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent        At December 31, 2011   (Dollars in millions)     -20 %     -10 %     0 %     10 %     20 % Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure   $ (100.3 )   $ (50.1 )   $ -     $ 50.1     $ 100.3        Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent        At December 31, 2010   (Dollars in millions)     -20 %     -10 %     0 %     10 %     20 % Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure   $ (81.4 )   $ (45.3 )   $ -     $ 52.0     $ 109.0      30 Table of Contents   		</c>

In third quarter 2011, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock, distributed October 3, 2011 in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend.  All shares and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted for all periods presented for the stock split.  For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders' Equity" to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.    34           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Company's management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures.  Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post-employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, income taxes, and purchase accounting.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  The Company's management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results.  These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.  The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write-offs having a material impact on financial results is low.  However, if one of the Company's key customers was to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant slow-down in the economy, the Company could increase its allowances.  This could result in a material charge to earnings.  The Company's allowances were $8 million and $5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered.  An impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing.  Reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill.  The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value.  If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill, additional steps, including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segments.  The Company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project.  In fourth quarter 2009, the Company announced the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, which resulted in an impairment of the Beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets. As the Company's assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change, additional write-downs may be required in the future.  If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings.  The Company recognized a definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8 million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas, industrial gasification project.  The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment charges of $133 million and goodwill and definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $46 million in results from continuing operations during 2009, related to the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project.    35          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount.  This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.  Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains.  Environmental assets, as defined by GAAP, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds.  When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.  These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets.  Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years.  If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Company's reserve, including the above remediation, was $39 million at December 31, 2011 and $40 million at December 31, 2010, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets' estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits.  Additionally, Eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance, health care, and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees' eligible survivors.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company's assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets.  In connection with its acquisition of Sterling Chemicals, Inc. ("Sterling") in 2011, the Company assumed Sterling's U.S. pension plans.  At December 31, 2011, the Company assumed discount rates of 4.88 percent and 4.83 percent on the defined benefit pension plans, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets of 8.75 percent and 5.50 percent, respectively.  The Company assumed a discount rate of 5.00 percent on its other post-employment benefit plan.  The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.    36          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The December 31, 2011 projected benefit obligation and 2012 expense are affected by year-end 2011 assumptions.  The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for all U.S. pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans.  The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted.  They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. Change in Assumption Impact on 2012 Pre-tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2011 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2011 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans             25 basis point decrease in discount  rate     +$6 Million     +$49 Million     +$27 Million             25 basis point increase in discount  rate     -$6 Million     -$47 Million     -$26 Million             25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets     +$3 Million     No Impact     N/A             25 basis point increase in expected return on assets     -$3 Million     No Impact     N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Company's pension and other post-employment benefit obligations are established each December 31.  The expected return on assets is based upon the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, private equity, and real estate markets.  Historically, over a ten year period, excluding 2008 which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession, the Company's average achieved actual return has been near the expected return on assets.  The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve.  This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post-employment benefit obligations.  As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets, which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years.  If actual experience differs from these long-term assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease.  The charges applied to earnings in 2011, 2010, and 2009 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $69 million, $56 million, and $45 million, respectively.    37          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post-employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during 2012 will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2012.  However, an after-tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, as of December 31, 2012 for the impact on the pension's projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any.  While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years.  The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors.  For further information regarding pension and other post-employment obligations, see Note 13, "Retirement Plans ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business.  The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount.  The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred.  Based upon facts and information currently available, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.  In the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position.  As of December 31, 2011, a valuation allowance of $42 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. Purchase Accounting In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition.  The Company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market.  The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets.  Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets.  Management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Company's results of operations.    38          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTATION OF NON- GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following non-GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.  The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. ·   Company and segment operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains described below; ·   Company earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs described below; ·   Cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the impact of a tax payment for the gain on the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, described below; and ·   Free cash flow (as defined), described below. During 2011, the Company recognized $7 million in restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling and a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project.  Also during 2011, cash flows included the use of $110 million for a tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. During 2010, the Company recognized $29 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges consisting of $20 million in severance and pension curtailment, $8 million for an intangible asset impairment resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, and $1 million of additional site closure charges. During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring including the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities.  The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net.  For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During first quarter 2010, the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.  For periods beginning after December 31, 2009, transfers of receivables interests that were previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet are included in trade receivables, net, and reflected as secured borrowings on the balance sheet.  The Company's Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2010 reflects an increase in trade receivables of $200 million, the amount transferred at December 31, 2009 under the securitization program, which reduced cash flows from operating activities by that amount for 2010. During 2009, the Company recognized $196 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily consisting of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Company's previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force.        39          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs, to improve the profitability of the Company, and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost, Eastman's management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs.  Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items.  In addition, management believes that cash provided by and used in operating activities should be considered both with and without the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the tax payment for the gain on the sale of the PET business, and dividends and capital expenditures.  Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance-based compensation.  These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2011 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $7.2 billion and $5.8 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Sales revenue increases were primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume.  The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp.  The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end-use demand primarily for CASPI segment products.  The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique Specialties Corporation ("Genovique") plasticizer product lines. Operating earnings were $1,021 million in 2011 compared to $862 million in 2010.  Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, described above in " Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ", operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year.  Operating earnings in 2011 also included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. Earnings from continuing operations were $657 million in 2011 compared to $425 million in 2010.  Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings from continuing operations were $652 million and $514 million, respectively.  Earnings from continuing operations were $4.59 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $2.88 per diluted share in 2010.  Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings were $4.56 per diluted share and $3.48 per diluted share, respectively. Eastman generated $625 million in cash from operating activities in 2011, including $102 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the $110 million tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011.  Excluding the impact of the tax payment and the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets described above in " Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ", cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million to $735 million in 2011 compared with 2010.  The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings.  Excluding the tax payment, the Company generated free cash flow of $142 million for full year 2011.  Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends.    40           MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2011 and early 2012, the Company completed and progressed on both organic (internal growth) and inorganic (external growth through joint venture and acquisition) growth initiatives: ·    In the PCI segment, the Company completed several initiatives in 2011 to expand its non-phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex do Brasil S.A. Indústrias Químicas ("Scandiflex").  The acquired Sterling idled plasticizer manufacturing unit is being retrofitted to produce non-phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012.  The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2-ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. ·   In the Specialty Plastics segment, the Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for Tritan TM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012.  The Company is expanding its capacity for cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM"), a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012.  The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate   capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. ·   In the CASPI segment, the Company completed an additional 20 percent expansion of its hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands, and an additional 10 percent debottleneck of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon facility in Longview, Texas in 2011.  The Company also acquired Dynaloy, LLC ("Dynaloy") in 2011 as part of its electronic materials growth initiative. ·   In the Fibers segment, in 2011 the Company entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China, expected to be operational in mid-2013. ·   The Company continues to explore and invest in research and development ("R&D") initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally-friendly chemistry.  These initiatives include the completion of a demonstration facility for market testing of acetylated wood, branded as Perennial Wood TM , in second half 2011 and commercial introduction in first quarter 2012 to select markets; the initial commercial introduction of the new Eastman Cerfis TM technology, with anticipation that the application will be expanded nationwide by the end of 2012; and the announcement of the new Eastman TM microfiber technology. ·   On January 26, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia Inc. ("Solutia"), a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals.  Under the terms of the agreement, Solutia stockholders will receive $22.00 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman common stock for each share of Solutia common stock, a total transaction value of approximately $4.7 billion, as of January 26, 2012, including the assumption of Solutia's debt.  The transaction remains subject to approval by Solutia's shareholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals as well as other customary closing conditions.  The transaction is expected to close in mid-2012.  The acquisition of Solutia is expected to: o   broaden Eastman's global presence, particularly in Asia Pacific; o   establish a combined platform with extensive organic growth opportunities through complementary technologies and business capabilities and an overlap of key end-markets; and o   expand Eastman's portfolio of sustainable products. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment.   The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment.  Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.  The total cash proceeds of the transaction were $615 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company's results of operations as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below.    41          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS     2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009   (Dollars in millions)   2011     2010     %     2010     2009     %                                           Sales   $ 7,178     $ 5,842       23 %   $ 5,842     $ 4,396       33 %    Volume effect                     7 %                     19 %    Price effect                     14 %                     10 %    Product mix effect                     2 %                     4 %    Exchange rate effect                     -- %                     -- % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 increased $1.3 billion.  The increase was primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments (particularly in the PCI segment) and higher sales volume primarily in the PCI segment.  The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp.  The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end-use demand primarily for CASPI segment products.  The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique plasticizer product lines. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 increased $1.4 billion.  The sales revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in all segments attributed to improved end-use demand in packaging, durable goods, and other markets, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives.  Sales revenue increases were also due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the PCI and CASPI segments.     2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009   (Dollars in millions)   2011     2010     Change     2010     2009     Change                                         Gross Profit   $ 1,640     $ 1,474       11 %   $ 1,474     $ 1,032       43 % As a percentage of sales     23 %     25 %             25 %     23 %         2011 Compared to 2010 Gross profit for 2011 increased compared with 2010 in all segments.  Gross profit increased primarily due to higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year.  Gross profit in 2011 included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility.    42          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 Gross profit for 2010 increased compared with 2009 in all segments.  The increase was due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs.  In addition, higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.  Gross profit in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue.  In first quarter 2010, the Company experienced a power outage at its Longview, Texas manufacturing facility.  Costs related to the outage were mostly offset by the settlement of the related insurance claim.  Gross profit in 2009 included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility.  The reconfiguration costs impacted the PCI and CASPI segments.      2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009   ( Dollars in millions )   2011     2010     Change     2010     2009     Change                                          Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   $ 469     $ 431       9 %   $ 431     $ 367       17 % Research and Development Expenses     158       152       4 %     152       124       23 %      $ 627     $ 583       8 %   $ 583     $ 491       19 % As a percentage of sales     9 %     10 %             10 %     11 %         2011 Compared to 2010 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased compensation expense and higher costs of growth and business development initiatives. Research and development expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. 2010 Compared to 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased performance-based compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, including expenses for growth initiatives. Research and development expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges (Gains), Net In 2011, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net gains of $8 million.  A gain of $15 million was recognized from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and restructuring charges of $7 million were primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling. In 2010, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $29 million and consisted primarily of severance and pension curtailment charges and an intangible asset impairment.  Severance charges of $18 million included $15 million for the previously announced voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010 and $3 million primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Genovique in second quarter 2010.  Restructuring charges of $2 million for pension curtailment are also related to the voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010.  The intangible asset impairment of $8 million resulted from an environmental regulatory change impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project in fourth quarter 2010.    43          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2009, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $196 million and consisted of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Company's previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges (Gains), Net ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.   Operating Earnings      2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009 ( Dollars in millions )   2011     2010     Change     2010     2009   Change                                     Operating earnings   $ 1,021     $ 862       18 %   $ 862     $ 345   >100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net     (8 )     29               29       196      Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net   $ 1,013     $ 891       14 %   $ 891     $ 541   65 % Net Interest Expense      2011 Compared to 2010     2010 Compared to 2009   (Dollars in millions)   2011     2010     Change     2010     2009     Change                                          Gross interest costs   $ 92     $ 108           $ 108     $ 99         Less:  Capitalized interest     9       3             3       14         Interest expense     83       105       (21 ) %     105       85       24 % Interest income     7       6               6       7           Net interest expense   $ 76     $ 99       (23 ) %   $ 99     $ 78       27 %                                                    2011 Compared to 2010 Net interest expense decreased $23 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to lower borrowing costs resulting from the debt restructuring in fourth quarter 2010 and higher capitalized interest resulting from higher capital spending. For 2012, the Company expects net interest expense to remain consistent with 2011, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net interest expense increased $21 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower capitalized interest resulting from lower capital spending and higher average borrowings. Early Debt Extinguishment Costs During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new debt securities with maturities five and ten years from issuance and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities.  The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long-term debt.  The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net.  For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.    44          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Charges (Income), Net   (Dollars in millions )   2011     2010     2009                        Foreign exchange transaction (gains) losses, net   $ (2 )   $ 8     $ 5   Investment (gains) losses, net     (16 )     (1 )     5   Other, net     (1 )     5       3   Other charges (income), net   $ (19 )   $ 12     $ 13   Included in other charges (income), net are gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, results from equity investments, gains or losses on business venture investments, gains from the sale of non-operating assets, certain litigation costs, fees on securitized receivables, other non-operating income, and other miscellaneous items.  Investment gains in 2011 included increased earnings from the Nanjing, China joint venture and sales of business venture investments.

The 2010 effective tax rate reflected a $9 million tax charge associated with a nondeductible, early distribution under the executive deferred compensation plan of previously earned compensation as a result of certain participants electing early withdrawal. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected an $11 million tax charge associated with the recapture of gasification investment tax credits, a $7 million tax charge associated with a change in accounting method for tax purposes to accelerate timing of deductions for manufacturing repairs expense and a $5 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be approximately 33 percent, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia.      45        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share        2011     2010     2009   (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)     $      EPS       $      EPS       $      EPS                                          Earnings from continuing operations   $ 657     $ 4.59     $ 425     $ 2.88     $ 154     $ 1.05   Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net of tax     (5 )     (0.03 )     18       0.12       127       0.86   Early debt extinguishment costs, net of tax     --       --       71       0.48       --       --   Earnings from continuing operations excluding items   $ 652     $ 4.56     $ 514     $ 3.48     $ 281     $ 1.91   Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share      2011     2010     2009   (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)     $      EPS       $      EPS       $      EPS                                          Earnings from continuing operations   $ 657     $ 4.59     $ 425     $ 2.88     $ 154     $ 1.05   Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax     8       0.06       13       0.08       (18 )     (0.12 ) Gain from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax     31       0.21       --       --       --       --   Net earnings   $ 696     $ 4.86     $ 438     $ 2.96     $ 136     $ 0.93   Earnings of $8 million and $13 million and a loss of $18 million, net of tax in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, resulted from discontinued operations of the PET business of the Performance Polymers segment.  Corporate costs which were allocated to the Performance Polymers segment have been reallocated to other segments in the Company's financial statements.  For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Company's products and operations are currently managed and reported in four reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, and the Specialty Plastics segment.  For additional information concerning the Company's operating businesses and products,   see Note 22, "Segment Information ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment.   The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment.  Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP.  For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.        46          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 22, "Segment Information ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as "other" sales revenue and operating losses.  As discussed in Note 22, these "other" operating losses are $50 million, $66 million, and $218 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Included in 2011 is a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project.  Included in 2010 and 2009 are $8 million and $179 million, respectively, in asset impairments related to the discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project.

Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher acetate tow sales volume in Asia Pacific and Europe and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs.  The restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix.  The higher sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were due to higher sales volume of acetate tow and of acetate yarn, both attributed to strengthened demand due to the global economic recovery. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume for acetate tow and acetate yarn, improved acetyl stream capacity utilization and a favorable shift in product mix.  The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. Growth Initiatives The Company has entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China.  The facility is expected to be operational in mid-2013.  Eastman has 45 percent ownership of the joint venture and expects to provide 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the joint venture from the Company's manufacturing facility in Kingsport. During first quarter 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of and commenced production at the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility.  The facility was operating at full production beginning in fourth quarter 2010.

Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2011 increased compared to 2010 due to higher selling prices, higher sales volume, and the increased benefits from cracking propane to produce low-cost propylene, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs.  The operating earnings increase was primarily in North America.  In 2011, operating earnings included $8 million from the acetyl technology license and costs of $11 million from the unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility.  In 2010, operating earnings included $12 million from the acetyl technology license.  In 2011, operating earnings included $7 million in restructuring charges, primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling.  In 2010, the restructuring charges reflect the segment's portion of severance charges.  2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices.  The higher sales volume included growth in plasticizer product lines, both in heritage products as well as in product lines added with the acquisition of Genovique plasticizer product lines, and also attributed to strengthened end-use demand due to the global economic recovery.  The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs, higher sales volume, and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs.  Operating earnings in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue.  The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges.  Operating results in 2009 included approximately $15 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. Growth Initiatives The Company completed several initiatives to expand its non-phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010.  In third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Sterling, a single site North American petrochemical producer.  The acquisition of Sterling will allow an idled plasticizer unit to be retrofitted to produce non-phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012 and the second phase to be determined at a later date based on demand.  Also, in third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Scandiflex, a manufacturer of plasticizers located in São Paulo, Brazil.  In second quarter 2010, the Company acquired Genovique, a global producer of specialty non-phthalate plasticizers for water-based adhesives and other applications.  The acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010 added to the Company's portfolio of non-phthalate plasticizers that serve high growth markets.  The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2-ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets.  To further improve its competitive cost position over purchasing olefins in the North American market, the Company restarted a previously idled cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility in 2010.  This restart was prompted by a favorable shift in market conditions for olefins raw materials that is expected to continue over the next several years.  The Company has three operating cracking units as well as a fourth cracking unit which is currently shutdown.    50          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Specialty Plastics Segment    2011 Compared to 2010    2010 Compared to 2009                Change                Change (Dollars in millions) 2011    2010    $    %    2010    2009    $    %                                                 Sales $ 1,195 $ 1,043 $ 152    15 % $ 1,043 $ 749 $ 294    39 %    Volume effect             (23)    (2) %                240    32 %    Price effect             161    16 %                14    2 %    Product mix effect             11    1 %                37    5 %    Exchange rate effect             3    -- %                3    -- %                                                                                                 Operating earnings 105    88    17    19 %    88    9    79    >100 %                                                 Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net --    5    (5)          5    4    1                                                       Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 105    93    12    13 %    93    13    80    >100 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices.  Selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene.  Slightly lower sales volume was attributed to weakened demand for copolyester product lines, particularly in packaging and consumer durable goods end markets, and some customer shift to other plastic materials that do not use paraxylene as a raw material. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs and the positive impact of the Eastman Tritan™ copolyester growth initiative.  Restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume.  The higher sales volume was attributed to improved end-use demand across all markets, in part due to the global economic recovery, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives for core copolyesters and the Tritan TM copolyester product lines.  Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, resulting in higher capacity utilization and lower unit costs.  The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges.    51          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Initiatives The Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for Tritan TM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012.  The Company is expanding its capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012.  The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate   capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012.  Eastman expects that the overall segment decrease in sales volume, particularly in second half 2011, is a temporary slowdown and expects growth to resume in the long-term. The monomer manufacturing facility and the first Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line in Kingsport, Tennessee commenced production in first quarter 2010.

Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments, and a favorable shift in product mix and higher sales volume, primarily in the Fibers segment.  The sales volume increase was less than other regions due to lower sales volume in the Specialty Plastics segment offsetting increases in the other segments. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments and higher sales volume, particularly in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Latin America increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the PCI and CASPI segments.  Lower sales volume was primarily due to sales being directed to other regions. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets.  To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros.  In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate.  For additional information concerning these practices, see Note 12, "Derivatives ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Part II, Item 7A--"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ."    52          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION – 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions)    2010    2009    Change    Volume Effect    Price Effect    Product Mix Effect    Exchange Rate Effect                                              United States and Canada $ 2,957 $ 2,252    31 %    19 %    12 %    -- %    -- % Asia Pacific    1,446    1,062    36 %    18 %    10 %    7 %    1 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa    1,150    835    38 %    23 %    5 %    12 %    (2) % Latin America    289    247    17 %    9 %    7 %    1 %    -- %    $ 5,842 $ 4,396    33 %    19 %    10 %    4 %    -- % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volumes in all segments, particularly the PCI segment, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Fibers segment.

LIQUIDITY , CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions)    2011    2010    2009 Net cash provided by (used in):                      Operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758    Investing activities    (142)    (442)    (369)    Financing activities    (423)    (411)    18 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents    1    1    (1) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ (277) $ 406                     Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 577 $ 516 $ 793    53          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (Dollars in millions)    2011    2010    2009                      Net cash provided by operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758    Impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance (1)    --    200    --    Impact of tax payment on the sale of the PET business (2)    110    --    --    Net cash provided by operating activities excluding items    735    775    758                      Additions to properties and equipment    (457)    (243)    (310) Dividends paid to stockholders    (136)    (127)    (128)                      Free Cash Flow $ 142 $ 405 $ 320 (1)    Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 reflected the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which resulted in $200 million of receivables, which were previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under the accounts receivable securitization program, being included on the 2010 balance sheet as trade receivables, net.  This increase in receivables reduced cash from operations by $200 million in first quarter 2010. (2)    Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 included the use of $110 million for the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011 and the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in 2010, cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million in 2011 compared with 2010.  The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings.  Working capital increased primarily due to increased inventory primarily as a result of increased raw material costs, increased accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales revenue, and decreased accounts payable primarily due to decreased raw material purchases due to lower sales volume near year-end. Excluding the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program, cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million in 2010 compared to 2009.  The increase was primarily due to significantly higher net earnings, offset by an increase in working capital and the inclusion in operating cash flow in 2009 of a benefit generated by a change in the tax method for capitalizing assets.  Working capital increased due to increased trade receivables primarily attributed to strong sales revenues throughout the year and increased inventories due to higher quantities attributed to improved demand for the Company's products and higher costs.  Both the increase in receivables and inventory were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable driven by a higher level of purchasing activity.  Cash used in investing activities decreased $300 million in 2011.  The decrease was primarily related to the receipt of $615 million from the sale of the PET business offsetting investment of $200 million in short-term time deposits having staggered maturities between three and ten months at the investment date and higher capital expenditures, as well as slightly lower payments for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures. Cash used in investing activities increased $73 million in 2010.  The increase was primarily related to higher cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures, including the acquisition of Genovique and the Korean acetate tow facility, which more than offset lower capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities increased $12 million in 2011.  Higher cash outflows for share repurchases and dividends and lower proceeds from borrowings and stock option exercises and other items were mostly offset by significantly lower cash outflows for repayment of borrowings.    54          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The increase in cash used in financing activities of $429 million in 2010 was primarily related to higher cash outflows for repayment of borrowings, including for early repayment of $500 million principal amount of outstanding long term debt, and share repurchases, which more than offset higher cash receipts for proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises and other items. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, in 2012, the Company expects to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends) of between $250 million and $300 million, capital expenditures of between $400 million and $425 million, and U.S. defined benefit pension plan funding of $100 million.  Assuming the acquisition of Solutia mid-2012, the priorities for uses of available cash in 2012 are expected to be payment of the quarterly cash dividend, repayment of debt, pension funding, and funding targeted growth initiatives. Liquidity The Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits as follows: (Dollars in millions)     December 31,       2011     2010     2009   Cash and cash equivalents   $ 577     $ 516     $ 793   Short-term time deposits     200       --       --                              Total cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits (1)   $ 777     $ 516     $ 793   (1)      Cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits are primarily held in the United States. In addition, at December 31, 2011, the Company had access to the sources of liquidity described below. In December 2011, the Company entered into a $750 million revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") expiring December 2016.  The Credit Facility replaces, and has terms substantially similar to, the $700 million revolving credit agreement entered into in April 2006 (the "Prior Credit Facility") which was terminated concurrently with the entry into the Credit Facility.  Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment.  In addition, the Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including required maintenance of certain financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes.  Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce capacity for borrowings available under the Credit Facility.  Given the expiration date of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, the Company also had a $200 million line of credit under its annually renewable accounts receivable securitization agreement ("A/R Facility").  The A/R Facility was renewed in July 2011.  Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and the Company pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility.  In addition, the A/R Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios.  The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented.  At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the A/R Facility.    For more information, see Note 10, "Borrowings " and Note 14, "Commitments ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.    55          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities.  The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long-term debt.  The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net.  See Note 10, "Borrowings " and Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding debt issuance and extinguishment. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 10, "Borrowings ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the Company made $102 million, $35 million, and $181 million, respectively, in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term time deposits,   and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements.  However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors " below.  The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. On January 26, 2012, in connection with its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia and in order to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with lenders which contains commitments for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility and sets out the principal terms of a senior unsecured term loan facility for up to $1.25 billion, with any commitments in respect of the term loan facility reducing on a dollar-for-dollar basis commitments under the bridge term loan facility.  Final terms of this financing will be contained in definitive agreements relating to such indebtedness. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $457 million, $243 million, and $310 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  Discretionary spending on certain capital projects was deferred in late 2009 in response to the global recession.  Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain strategic growth initiatives through first nine months 2010.  In fourth quarter 2010, the Company increased spending on discretionary infrastructure projects and certain strategic growth initiatives to $110 million which carried into 2011.  Capital expenditures in 2011 primarily increased due to organic growth initiatives, particularly in the Specialty Plastics, CASPI, and PCI segments.  Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects that 2012 capital spending will be between $400 million and $425 million. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects 2012 depreciation and amortization to be slightly higher than 2011 expenses of $273 million, primarily due to the completion of capacity expansions and a full year of depreciation on assets from 2011 acquisitions completed in 2011, including Sterling. Other Commitments At December 31, 2011, the Company's obligations related to outstanding indebtedness in the form of notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.6 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 15 years.    56          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.4 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business.  The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling $105 million over a period of several years.  Of the total lease commitments, approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 60 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 30 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.6 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post-employment obligations, and environmental reserves. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions )   Payments Due for   Period   Notes and Debentures     Credit Facility Borrowings and Other     Interest Payable     Purchase Obligations     Operating Leases     Other Liabilities (a)     Total (b)                                                2012   $ 147     $ 6     $ 87     $ 276     $ 27     $ 270     $ 813   2013             --       81       264       20       51       416   2014     -       --       81       143       11       52       287   2015     250       --       82       137       8       56       533   2016             --       74       137       7       67       285   2017 and beyond     1,195       --       454       461       32       1,100       3,242   Total   $ 1,592     $ 6     $ 859     $ 1,418     $ 105     $ 1,596     $ 5,576   (a)    Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post-employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated.  The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors.  Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. (b)    Not included in the above table is the expected payment of approximately $2.7 billion in cash in order to complete the Solutia acquisition or any obligations to be assumed upon completion of the acquisition of Solutia. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets.  Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2011 totaled $184 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft.  Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $139 million and $45 million will expire in 2012 and 2016 and beyond, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. As described in Note 7, "Equity Investments ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastman's Kingsport, Tennessee plant.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method.   Eastman's net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $28 million and $32 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the venture's accumulated deficits, long-term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester.      57          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes.  Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The accounting guidance on consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") is effective for all VIEs or potential VIEs the Company is involved with on or after January 1, 2010.  This guidance amended the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments.  The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not VIEs or, in the case of Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company has shared control of the VIE.  As such, the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur.  Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company.  These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications.  The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims.  However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or liquidity. Treasury Stock On October 3, 2011, the Company distributed a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend.  For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders ' Equity " to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In October 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $700 million for repurchase of the Company's outstanding common stock.  The Company completed the $700 million repurchase authorization in November 2010, acquiring a total of 22.4 million shares.   In August 2010, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $300 million for the repurchase of the Company's outstanding common.  The Company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in June 2011, acquiring a total of 7.1 million shares. In February 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company.  As of December 31, 2011, a total of 4,757,639 shares of common stock have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $202 million. During 2011, the Company repurchased 7,258,031 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $316 million. Dividends The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.235 per share in first and second quarters and $0.260 per share in third and fourth quarters 2011 for a total of $0.990 per share in 2011.  The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.220 per share in first, second, and third quarters and $0.235 per share in fourth quarter 2010 for a total of $0.895 per share in 2010, and $0.220 per share for all quarters, for a total of $0.880 per share in 2009.  The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.260 per share during the first quarter of 2012, payable on April 2, 2012 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2012.    58          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies.  In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs.  In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman's policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.  Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount.  This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.  Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains.  Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds.  When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements.  These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets.  The best estimate accrued to date over the facilities' estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is $28 million at December 31, 2011. GAAP requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation ("CARO") when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated.  The Company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of December 31, 2011.  Although it may have CAROs   at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos.  The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs.  The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    59          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental asset retirement obligations accounted for approximately 75 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2011.  Currently, the Company's environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years.  If the Company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $219 million, $200 million, and $173 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included $35 million in expenditures for engineering and construction in 2011.  Cash expenditures in 2012 are expected to increase primarily as a result of full year integration of 2011 acquisitions and of the expected mid-2012 acquisition of Solutia, although no assurances of the timing of completion of this acquisition or the related cash expenditures can be provided.  Other than potential capital expenditures at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers, the Company does not currently expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, although no assurances can be provided as to the timing or amount of any capital expenditures that may arise as a result of the completion of the expected acquisition of Solutia.  Potential capital expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations, but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on final regulation requirements and the Company's method of addressing those requirements. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman's costs.  The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations.  The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit.  For additional information see Note 12, "Derivatives ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures with the purpose of converging the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board.  The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.  The guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement requirements along with amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurements and disclosures.  The Company has concluded that the new guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or related disclosures.    60          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In June 2011, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to presentation of comprehensive income.  The standards update is intended to help financial statement users better understand the causes of an entity's change in financial position and results of operation.  It is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.  The amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.  The amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  The FASB amended this guidance in December 2011 to postpone a requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented and reinstate previous guidance related to such reclassifications.  Upon adoption, the Company will continue to present components of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings.  Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued amended accounting guidance to enhance disclosure requirements for instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement.  It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its disclosures.  Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. OUTLOOK The Company expects to benefit from the strength of its businesses based on modest global economic growth and aided by the full year integration of 2011 acquisitions including Sterling and Scandiflex.   The Company expects the volatility of market prices for raw materials and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility.   The Company expects to continue with growth initiatives in all segments, as well as to continue to explore and invest in R&D initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally-friendly chemistry.   The Company expects to complete the acquisition of Solutia mid-2012.  This acquisition is subject to approval by Solutia's shareholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.    Excluding the impact of the expected acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects:   ·   capital spending to be between $400 million and $425 million for organic growth initiatives and maintenance; and   ·   between $250 million and $300 million of free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends).   Assuming mid-2012 completion of the Solutia acquisition, the Company expects full year diluted earnings per share in 2012 to be approximately $5, excluding acquisition-related costs and charges.   See " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors " below.    61          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under " Outlook " and certain other statements in this Annual Report which are not statements of historical fact may be "forward-looking statements" as defined in, and subject to the protections of, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws.  These statements, and other written and oral forward-looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; expectations regarding the completion of the acquisition of Solutia including our ability to achieve the expected benefits and synergies from the acquired businesses; pending and future  legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated and other future restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; the timing of, and benefits from, the integration of and expected business and financial performance of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements.  Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions and other factors.  These plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results.  There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of any proposed acquisitions, and the timing or actual achievement of expected benefits from, integration plans relating to, and expected synergies from, acquired businesses.  Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward-looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized.  In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statement.  Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company. While economic and financial market conditions have improved from those in 2008 and 2009, continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, particularly in Europe, may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  The Company's business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent   global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that  affected the global economy.  If the global economy or financial markets again deteriorate or experience significant new disruptions, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected; in addition the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.    62          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs.  These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations.  In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities. The Company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure. Significant limitation of the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, and financial condition.  Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect our financial results. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal (or "organic") development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses.  These growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities.  There can be no assurance that such efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses)   will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations.  There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions, expected benefits of proposed acquisitions, integration plans, and expected synergies therefrom.  There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers.  Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects.    63          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The pending acquisition of Solutia exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, both before and after its completion, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. In connection with Eastman's agreement to complete the acquisition of Solutia, and during its pendency, the Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman.  These risks include, but are not limited to: ·   that the Company may not complete the acquisition of Solutia on terms contained in the merger agreement, which could impact the purchase price to be paid, assets to be acquired, covenants relating to Eastman's or Solutia's operations, or timing thereof; ·   that the Company may continue to incur significant additional costs and expend significant additional time and effort prior to the closing and if the transaction is delayed or not consummated, the Company may not be able to realize any benefit therefrom; ·   that the Company may not be able to obtain the financing it intends to obtain in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; and ·   that Solutia can require Eastman to complete the acquisition in certain situations that could result in the Company incurring significant additional costs. In the event the Company does complete the acquisition of Solutia, it may become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman.  These risks and uncertainties include that the Company: ·   will be required to incur substantial additional indebtedness in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; ·   may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, or tax synergies expected from the acquisition of Solutia, or there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; and ·   may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate Solutia's businesses into Eastman's. Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Company's future compliance costs. The Company's facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations.  The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based.  The amount accrued reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties.  Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs.  Pending and proposed U.S. Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations.  The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance.  This disclosure, including that under " Outlook " and " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ," and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given.  The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.  Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects.    64      ITEM 7A .   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") has exposure to market risks from changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations.  To mitigate the Company's exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and/or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements.  From time to time, to manage the Company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, these borrowings, investments, and swaps were predominately U.S. dollar denominated.  The nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.  For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates.  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately $145 million and $123 million, respectively.  This exposure is primarily related to long-term debt with fixed interest rates. The Company's operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business.  In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company from time to time enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies.  The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures.  It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above.  The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  At December 31, 2011, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $53 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates.  At December 31, 2010, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $60 million, with an additional $6 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates.  Since the Company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy.  To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, natural gas, and ethane, the Company enters into option and forward contracts.  At December 31, 2011, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $10 million with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.  At December 31, 2010, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $6 million, with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter.    65        		</c>

		<id>sample-data/0000916365-12-000017.txt</id>			<c>Item 7 .                       Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del’s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: ·   Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; ·   Hardware, truck, towing and tool products; ·   Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys; ·   Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and ·   Work/recreational clothing and footwear.     We operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 31, 2011.  Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores, inclusive of recently identified small market locations.   Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers. Fiscal 2011 was once again a year of strong performance for our Company. We achieved double-digit increases in both sales and earnings on top of last year’s record results.  In fiscal 2011, our net revenues increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion compared to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010, and we increased our fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share to $3.01 versus $2.25 in fiscal 2010.  We also ended the year with $199 million in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly $211 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.3%. We plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012, a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0%.  We opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010, a square footage increase of approximately 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to:  (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong private label offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth. Our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures, limited maintenance capital, and low occupancy and operating costs. The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2011 was approximately $1.2 million. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $82,000 for pre-opening costs.  Our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years. Our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements (to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems), and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs.  Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $166.2 million and $96.5 million, respectively.  We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $160 million to $170 million as we continue to invest in new store growth, existing stores, distribution center capacity and information technology.    17    We place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. Modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing, improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance.   Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies.  In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.  Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates.    18    Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions          Inventory Valuation:       Inventory Impairment       We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks.  The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term.  However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.   Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented.   We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment.  However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.   A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $590,000 in fiscal 2011.          Shrinkage       We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts.  The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes.  Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience.  We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve.  However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $860,000 in fiscal 2011.      19      Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions          Vendor Support       We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs.  The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few  years.  Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product.  Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold.  During interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations.  Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known.  Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2011. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 31, 2011, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales.          Freight       We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution.  Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories.  This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.1 million.      20      Description   Judgments and Uncertainties   Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions          Self-Insurance Reserves:       We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans.  We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves.  However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2011.          Sales Tax Audit Reserve:       A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers.  We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction.  Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws.  The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.  These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance.  Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state. We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. Our sales tax audit assessment methodology remained materially consistent in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve.  However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $720,000 in fiscal 2011.      21    Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions       Tax Contingencies:       Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.  Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.  Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 31, 2011 would have affected net income by approximately $460,000 in fiscal 2011.      22    Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions          Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:       Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level.  The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis.  However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.    23    Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2011 and 2010 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts):      First Quarter (13 weeks)     Second Quarter (13 weeks)     Third Quarter (13 weeks)     Fourth Quarter (14 weeks)     Total   2011                               Net sales   $ 836,576     $ 1,178,363     $ 977,776     $ 1,240,028     $ 4,232,743   Gross margin     273,606       402,497       327,603       403,166       1,406,872   Operating income     28,766       144,263       68,129       111,545       352,703   Net income     18,335       91,160       42,733       70,512       222,740                                              Net income per share: (1)                                         Basic   $ 0.25     $ 1.27     $ 0.60     $ 0.99     $ 3.10   Diluted   $ 0.24     $ 1.23     $ 0.58     $ 0.96     $ 3.01                                              Same-store sales increase     10.7 %     4.6 %     11.5 %     7.6 %     8.2 %                                                 First Quarter (13 weeks)     Second Quarter (13 weeks)     Third Quarter (13 weeks)     Fourth Quarter (13 weeks)     Total   2010                               Net sales   $ 710,917     $ 1,065,656     $ 829,114     $ 1,032,649     $ 3,638,336   Gross margin     230,931       360,129       275,688       336,917       1,203,665   Operating income     16,467       123,648       47,407       78,702       266,224   Net income     10,582       77,318       29,863       50,209       167,972                                              Net income per share: (1)                                         Basic   $ 0.15     $ 1.06     $ 0.41     $ 0.69     $ 2.31   Diluted   $ 0.14     $ 1.04     $ 0.40     $ 0.67     $ 2.25                                              Same-store sales increase     2.8 %     6.1 %     5.0 %     13.1 %     7.0 %                                                (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year.    24    Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended.  The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 contained 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales.      2011     2010     2009   Net sales     100.0 %     100.0 %     100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a)     66.8       66.9       67.5   Gross margin (a)     33.2       33.1       32.5   Selling, general and administrative expenses (a)     23.0       23.9       24.4   Depreciation and amortization     1.9       1.9       2.1   Operating income     8.3       7.3       6.0   Interest expense, net     --       --       0.1   Income before income taxes     8.3       7.3       5.9   Income tax provision     3.0       2.7       2.2   Net income     5.3 %     4.6 %     3.7 %                            (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses; refer to Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010.  Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase.  Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010. This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011. The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise.  Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast.  We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories.  Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points. Store growth was approximately 8.4%, a net increase of 84 stores since December 25, 2010.  Non-comp sales (defined as stores opened less than one year) for fiscal 2011 were $237.5 million, a 6.4% increase over total fiscal 2010 net sales.  Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales. In fiscal 2011, we opened 85 new stores (compared to 74 new stores in fiscal 2010), relocated three stores (compared to no relocations in fiscal 2010) and closed one store (compared to three closed stores in fiscal 2010). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010:      Percent of Sales Product Category:   2011   2010 Livestock and Pet   40 %   39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck   23     23   Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products   21     22   Clothing and Footwear   10     10   Agriculture   6     6   Total   100 %   100 %    25    Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010.  As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010.  The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs.  Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, private branding and price optimization.  We expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012.  Additionally, we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases.  However, we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010.  The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs. Total SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010.  The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system.  The Company’s new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program.  In 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009. Same-store sales for fiscal 2010 were $3.43 billion, a 7.0% increase over fiscal 2009. This compares to a 1.1% same-store sales decrease in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store average ticket decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010. The same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment. New store growth was approximately 7.6% or 71 net stores opened since December 26, 2009.  Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales.  Non-comp sales for fiscal 2009 were $230.7 million, a 7.7% increase over total fiscal 2008 net sales. In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two relocations in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2009). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010 and 2009:      Percent of Sales Product Category:   2010   2009 Livestock and Pet   39 %   39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck   23     23   Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products   22     22   Clothing and Footwear   10     10   Agriculture   6     6   Total   100 %   100 % Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009.  As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009.  The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing.    26    As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009.  The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense.  Total SG&A expenses increased 10.2% to $937.4 million from $850.3 million in fiscal 2009.  The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales growth and increased incentive compensation. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $38.2 million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program.  In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources     In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends.  Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit.  Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively. Working Capital At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $629.6 million, a $12.5 million increase from December 25, 2010.  This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):      2011     2010     Variance   Current assets:                   Cash and cash equivalents   $ 176.9     $ 257.3     $ (80.4 ) Restricted cash     21.9       --       21.9   Short-term investments     --       15.9       (15.9 ) Inventories     830.8       736.5       94.3   Prepaid expenses and other current assets     51.7       34.0       17.7   Deferred income taxes     8.9       --       8.9          1,090.2       1,043.7       46.5   Current liabilities:                         Accounts payable   $ 266.4     $ 247.4     $ 19.0   Accrued employee compensation     48.3       34.6       13.7   Other accrued expenses     134.0       127.4       6.6   Current portion of capital lease obligation     --       0.1       (0.1 ) Income taxes payable     11.9       8.3       3.6   Deferred income taxes     --       8.8       (8.8 )        460.6       426.6       34.0                              Working capital   $ 629.6     $ 617.1     $ 12.5   In comparison to prior year-end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in cash.  The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation. Average inventory per store increased to $723,000 for fiscal 2011 compared to $709,000 for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures, principally due to the construction of a new distribution center.    27    Borrowings and Credit Facilities Through October 23, 2011 we were party to a Senior Credit Facility (the “Credit Agreement”), which provided for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively) with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.  The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments).  The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February 2012. On October 24, 2011, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement.  The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sublimits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively).  This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters.   At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility.  There were $15.0 million and $27.4 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively.  Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) (0.30% at December 31, 2011) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio (0.50% at December 31, 2011).  We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 31, 2011).   There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants:  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio.  The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense (“consolidated EBITDAR”) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent).  The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR.  The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens.  We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations.  Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company’s common stock and payment of common stock dividends.  The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions):      2011     2010     2009   Net cash provided by operating activities   $ 254.1     $ 222.6     $ 215.3   Net cash used in investing activities     (171.3 )     (112.1 )     (73.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities     (163.2 )     (26.0 )     (5.6 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ (80.4 )   $ 84.5     $ 135.9   Operating Activities The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):      2011     2010     Variance   Net income   $ 222.7     $ 168.0     $ 54.7   Depreciation and amortization     80.3       69.8       10.5   Stock compensation expense     15.1       11.8       3.3   Deferred income taxes     1.9       2.7       (0.8 ) Inventories and accounts payable     (75.3 )     (74.3 )     (1.0 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets     (17.8 )     (3.2 )     (14.6 ) Accrued expenses     20.0       38.5       (18.5 ) Income taxes payable     3.6       1.0       2.6   Other, net     3.6       8.3       (4.7 ) Net cash provided by operations   $ 254.1     $ 222.6     $ 31.5      28    Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center.  The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments.  The increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions):      2010     2009     Variance   Net income   $ 168.0     $ 119.7     $ 48.3   Depreciation and amortization     69.8       66.3       3.5   Stock compensation expense     11.8       12.1       (0.3 ) Deferred income taxes     2.7       (11.1 )     13.8   Inventories and accounts payable     (74.3 )     (29.9 )     (44.4 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets     (3.2 )     11.2       (14.4 ) Accrued expenses     38.5       22.3       16.2   Income taxes payable     1.0       7.8       (6.8 ) Other, net     8.3       16.9       (8.6 ) Net cash provided by operations   $ 222.6     $ 215.3     $ 7.3   The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory, net of accounts payable, and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets. Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances.  Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account.  The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable.  The increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011.  The decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors.   Investing Activities Investing activities used $171.3 million, $112.1 million and $73.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures.  Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions):      2011     2010     2009   Distribution center capacity and improvements   $ 56.3     $ 22.5     $ 4.3   New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened     44.9       28.6       31.7   Purchase of previously leased and self developed stores     32.2       11.6       --   Existing stores     18.7       17.6       18.4   Information technology     12.3       14.9       17.6   Corporate and other     1.8       1.3       2.0        $ 166.2     $ 96.5     $ 74.0   The above table reflects 85 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2011, compared to 74 new stores during fiscal 2010.   We also purchased 12 of our existing lease stores during fiscal 2011 compared to four existing stores in fiscal 2010. The increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers.   Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets.  We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $160 million and $170 million in fiscal 2012.  We plan to open approximately five to 10 more stores in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011.  While we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal 2012, we estimate to spend approximately $30 million on our distribution center network, principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements.  Additionally, we plan to invest approximately $30 million in information technology upgrades, including point-of-sale system enhancements, continued roll-out of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers, an upgrade of our e-commerce site, and store and store support center hardware refreshes. 29    Financing Activities Financing activities used $163.2 million, $26.0 million, and $5.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation. On April 28, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $1 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015.  The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.  The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions.  Repurchased shares will be held in treasury.  The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million, 0.8 million and 0.4 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $180.0 million, $38.2 million and $15.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance.  As of December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $562.9 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.07 per share to $0.12 per share.  We paid dividends totaling $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):   Payment Due by Period   Total Contractual Obligations   Less than 1 year   1-3 years   4-5 years   More than 5 years Operating leases $ 1,620,771   $ 188,311   $ 358,343   $ 318,176   $ 755,941 Capital leases (1)   2,511     146     292     292     1,781 Purchase obligations (2)   9,413     9,413     --     --     --   $ 1,632,695   $ 197,870   $ 358,635   $ 318,468   $ 757,722                               (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2012, as well as the purchase of a previously leased store.   At December 31, 2011, there were $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $20.9 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash. The letter of credit outside the Senior Credit Facility will automatically increase by $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to $21.9 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit.  The balances for these arrangements are discussed above.  We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets.  Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs. 30    Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-08, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (“qualitative assessment”). If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test. The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. I tem 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility.  The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at both December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010) or LIBOR (0.30%  and 0.26% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% at December 31, 2011 and 0.35% to 0.90% at December 25, 2010) based on our leverage ratio (0.50% and 0.40% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively).  We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% at December 31, 2011 and 0.06% to 0.18% at December 25, 2010) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at December 31, 2011 and 0.08% December 25, 2010). Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal.  Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales.  We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season. Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality.  Due to the competitive environment, such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.    31    		</c>

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Our financial condition and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of what may be expected in future years.   (a). Business Overview and Summary   We are, as of February 22, 2012, a development stage company (prior to February 22, 2012 we were an exploration stage company) with a focus on the acquisition of precious and base metal properties with exploration potential and the development or purchase of royalty interests. We announced on February 22, 2012 the completion of a feasibility study on our Mt. Hamilton project (the “Feasibility Study”), prepared by SRK Consulting (US), Inc. of Lakewood, Colorado (“SRK”). As a result of the completion of the Feasibility Study, we have earned an 80% interest in the Mt. Hamilton project and intend to develop the Mt. Hamilton project, subject to a number of factors including obtaining necessary permits and availability of required capital, none of which is currently in place. The Mt. Hamilton project is discussed below under “Ely Gold Investment and the Mt. Hamilton Joint Venture.” In addition, we acquire and hold a portfolio of exploration properties for future sale, joint venture or to create a royalty prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves. Although our mineral properties may be developed in the future by us or through a joint venture, and we currently intend to develop the Mt. Hamilton project, we have never developed a mineral property. We may also evaluate mineral properties to potentially buy a royalty.   Solitario was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 15, 1984 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crown Resources Corporation. We have been actively involved in this business since 1993. We recorded revenues from joint venture delay rental payments related to our Bongará project of $200,000, each year, during 2011, 2010 and 2009 and we recorded $42,000 in delay rental joint venture property payments during 2011 related to a $50,000 payment received on our Mercurio project, less capitalized costs of $8,000. Previously, our last significant revenues were recorded in 2000 upon the sale of our Yanacocha property for $6,000,000.  We expect that future revenues from joint venture payments or the sale of properties, if any, would also occur on an infrequent basis. At December 31, 2011, we had 12 exploration properties in Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Brazil, and two royalty properties in Peru and one royalty property in Brazil. We are conducting exploration activities in all of those countries. As discussed below under “Recent Developments,” in August 2010 we signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Ely Gold & Minerals, Inc. (“Ely”), and in December 2010 we signed the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement for Mt. Hamilton, LLC (the “MH Agreement”) to earn up to an 80% interest in the Mt. Hamilton project located in Nevada.   In addition to our work at Mt. Hamilton, we have expertise in identifying mineral properties with promising mineral potential, acquiring these mineral properties and exploring them to enable us to sell, joint venture or create a royalty on these properties prior to the establishment of proven and probable reserves. For these early-stage projects, one of our primary goals is to discover economic deposits on our mineral properties and advance these deposits, either on our own or through joint ventures, up to the development stage (development activities include, among other things, the completion of a feasibility study for the identification of proven and probable reserves, as well as permitting and preparing a deposit for mining). At that point, or sometime prior to that point, we would attempt to either sell our mineral properties, pursue their development either on our own or through a joint venture with a partner that has expertise in mining operations or create a royalty with a third party that continues to advance the property.   In analyzing our activities, the most significant aspect relates to results of our exploration and potential development activities and those of our joint venture partners on a property-by-property basis. When our exploration or development activities, including drilling, sampling and geologic testing, indicate a project may not be economic or contain sufficient geologic or economic potential we may impair or completely write-off the property. Another significant factor in the success or failure of our activities is the price of commodities. For example, when the price of gold is up, the value of gold-bearing mineral properties increases; however, it also becomes more difficult and expensive to locate and acquire new gold-bearing mineral properties with potential to have economic deposits. We anticipate the success of our development activities on our Mt. Hamilton property will become increasingly important in the future.   The potential sale, joint venture or development of our mineral properties will occur, if at all, on an infrequent basis. Accordingly, while we conduct development activities at the Mt. Hamilton project, we need to maintain and replenish our capital resources. We have met our need for capital in the past through (i) the sale of properties, which last occurred in 2000 with the sale of our Yanacocha property for $6,000,000; (ii) joint venture payments, including delay rental payments of $200,000, each year, respectively, received during 2010 and 2009 on our Bongará property; (iii) sale of our investment in Kinross; (iv) short-term margin borrowing secured by our investment in Kinross; and (v) issuance of common stock, including exercise of options. We have reduced our exposure to the costs of our exploration activities in the past through the use of joint      37     Table of Contents      ventures; however we do not have any current plans to joint venture Mt. Hamilton. Although we anticipate these practices will continue for the foreseeable future, we can provide no assurance that these sources of capital will be available in sufficient amounts to meet our needs, if at all.   (b). Recent Developments   Feasibility Study   On February 22, 2012, we announced the completion of the Feasibility Study, and as a result we earned an 80% interest in MH-LLC, and became a development-stage company (but not a company in the “Development Stage”) and we reported the following mineral reserves at our Mt. Hamilton project:     Mineral Reserves Statement, Centennial Gold-Silver Deposit,  White Pine County, Nevada SRK Consulting (Inc.)     Reserve Category     Tons (millions)     Gold Grade     Silver Grade*     Contained  Gold (koz)**     Contained Silver (koz)**     oz/ton     g/tonne     oz/ton     g/tonne     Proven       0.923     0.032     1.10     0.155     5.31     29.3       142.7     Probable     21.604     0.021     0.72     0.134     4.59     457.8     2,884.3     Proven + Probable     22.527     0.022     0.75     0.136     4.66     487.1     3,028.2 *Reported silver grade is cyanide soluble. **Some numbers may not add due to rounding.     Equity financing   On April 13, 2011, we sold 3,400,000 shares of our common stock in the Offering at a price to the public of $2.50 per share and on May 9, 2011, we sold an additional 510,000 shares at $2.50 per share, upon the exercise of the underwriter’s option to cover over-allotments. The net proceeds from the Offering were $8,937,000 after the underwriter’s commission of six percent totaling $587,000 and offering costs of $251,000. The Offering was made pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 previously filed with the SEC on March 18, 2011, which was declared effective on March 29, 2011. A prospectus supplement relating to the Offering has been filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC's website located at www.sec.gov.   Ely Gold investment and the Mt. Hamilton Joint Venture           	On August 26, 2010, we signed a letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Ely to make certain equity investments into Ely and to joint venture Ely’s Mt. Hamilton gold project, which was wholly-owned by DHI-Minerals (US) Ltd. (“DHI-US”). DHI-US is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Ely. The LOI and the joint venture terms and equity investments, described below were subject to the approval (the “Approval”) by Ely shareholders and regulatory approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”), which was received on October 18, 2010. Pursuant to the LOI, on August 26, 2010 and October 19, 2010, we made private placements of Cdn$250,000 each in Ely. We received a total of 3,333,333 shares of Ely common stock and warrants to purchase a total of 1,666,667 shares of Ely stock (the “Ely Warrants”) for an exercise price of Cdn$0.25 per share, which expire two years from the date of purchase. The placements were part of the LOI to joint venture Ely’s Mt. Hamilton gold project. On November 12, 2010 we made an initial contribution of $300,000 for a 10% interest in MH-LLC which was formed in December 2010. The terms of the joint venture are set forth in the Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of Mt. Hamilton LLC (“MH-LLC”) between us and DHI-US (the “MH Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the MH Agreement, we determined that upon formation, MH-LLC was a variable interest entity (a “VIE”) and we controlled MH-LLC and were the primary beneficiary of MH-LLC in accordance with ASC 810. As a result of our controlling interest in MH-LLC, we consolidated MH-LLC and its debt with an initial fair value of $3,066,000 related to MH-LLC. As a result of the completion of the Feasibility Study, we have earned an 80% interest in the Mt. Hamilton project and intend to develop the Mt. Hamilton project, subject to a number of factors including obtaining necessary permits and availability of required capital, none of which is currently in place. See a more complete discussion of Ely and MH-LLC in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, “Ely Gold investment and the Mt. Hamilton Joint Venture” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” During the year ended December 31, 2011, we made cash payments of $200,000 and issued 50,000 shares of common stock, valued at $140,000, to DHI-US as part of our earn-in to MH-LLC. These payments were recorded as contra-noncontrolling interest account in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet.       38     Table of Contents      Royalty buy-down   On May 17, 2011, we entered into an agreement, along with our subsidiary MH-LLC, with an underlying royalty holder on our Mt. Hamilton property whereby we delivered, for the benefit of MH-LLC, 344,116 shares of our common stock, with a fair market value of $1,000,000 based upon a 20-day weighted average quoted stock price, and $1,520,000 of cash, to reduce the future net smelter royalty (the “Royalty Buy-down”) from a maximum royalty of 8% to a maximum royalty of 6%. MH-LLC retains its existing right to further reduce the net smelter royalty at Mt. Hamilton by an additional 5%, to an ultimate royalty of 1%, as further discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, “Ely Gold investment and the Mt. Hamilton Joint Venture” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. As part of the Royalty Buy-down transaction, we agreed to loan $504,000 to DHI-US, the non-controlling member of MH-LLC, for its mutually agreed 20% of the total purchase price contributed by us to MH-LLC to fund the Royalty Buy-down. This loan is unsecured; bears interest at 6% per annum and the loan and any accrued interest thereon will only be repaid from 80% of DHI-US share of distributions from MH-LLC, if any. We have recorded the loan of $504,000 as an offset to DHI-US’s non-controlling interest in MH-LLC, as the loan represents a claim on DHI-US’s share of the future distributions from MH-LLC. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we accrued $19,000, of interest on the $504,000 loan as an offset to DHI-US’s minority interest in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet.   Investment in Kinross   We have a significant investment in Kinross at December 31, 2011, which consists of 850,000 shares of Kinross common stock. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we sold 130,000, 70,000 and 100,000 shares, respectively, of Kinross common stock for proceeds of $2,035,000, $1,301,000 and $1,852,000. As of March 8, 2012, we own 820,000 shares of Kinross common stock. Our investment in Kinross common stock represents a significant concentration of risk and any significant fluctuation in the market value of Kinross common shares could have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources. In October 2007, we entered into a collar that limited the proceeds on 900,000 shares of Solitario's investment in Kinross common shares. On April 12, 2011, the final tranche of the Kinross Collar due on that date expired, and 100,000 shares under the Kinross Collar were released. The Kinross Collar has expired as of that date and no shares are subject to the Kinross Collar. No shares were delivered to UBS under the Kinross Collar and no cash was paid or received upon termination of the Kinross Collar. On April 13, 2010, a tranche of the Kinross Collar due on that date expired, and 400,000 shares under the Kinross Collar were released. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Solitario has from time to time sold covered calls against its holdings of Kinross. As of December 31, 2011 Solitario has no covered calls outstanding against its holdings of Kinross shares. The Kinross Collar and Kinross Calls are discussed below under Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, "Derivative instruments." As of December 31, 2011, Solitario has borrowed $2,000,000 in a margin loan against its holdings of Kinross shares. The short-term margin loan is discussed below under Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, “Short-term debt.”   Mineral property   During the year ended December 31, 2011, we capitalized a total of $235,000, related to the acquisition of certain leases located near the Mt. Hamilton project, owned by MH-LLC and we capitalized $2,520,000 for the Royalty Buy-down discussed above. We also capitalized $10,000 of mineral properties in Mexico during the year ended December 31, 2011. All exploration costs on our properties, including any additional costs incurred for subsequent lease payments or exploration activities related to our projects, are expensed as incurred.   Stock option liability – Change in accounting principle  	   On January 1, 2011, we changed our accounting for stock options to equity accounting from liability accounting in accordance with ASU 2010-13. In accordance with ASU 2010-13, this change in accounting principle has been made on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2011 with a reduction to stock option liability of $2,775,000, an increase to additional paid-in-capital of $1,240,000 and a reduction in accumulated deficit of $992,000, net of deferred taxes of $543,000. The newly adopted accounting principle is preferable because it improves consistency in financial reporting by eliminating diversity in accounting practice. See Note 9, “Employee stock compensation plans” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”     (c). Results of Operations   Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2011 to the year ended December 31, 2010       39     Table of Contents      We had a net loss of $3,377,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a net loss of $4,066,000 or $0.14 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the increase in net loss during 2011 compared to the net loss during 2010 were (i) $3,700,000 of exploration costs on our Mt. Hamilton project compared to $1,214,000 during 2010; (ii) an increase in our non-stock option general and administrative expense to $2,160,000 during 2011 compared to $1,767,000 during 2010; (iii) a loss on derivative instruments and an increase in our interest expense, net during 2011 compared to gains for both items during 2010; (iv) no gain on sale on deconsolidation of PBM during 2011 compared to a gain on deconsolidation of $724,000 during 2010; (v) an increase in the equity in our loss of PBM to $623,000 during 2011 compared to a loss of $220,000 during 2010; and (vi) a reduction in our income tax benefit during 2011 to $635,000 compared to a net income tax benefit of $1,159,000 during 2010. Partially offsetting these increases in costs were (i) a reduction in non-Mt. Hamilton exploration expenses to $2,246,000 during 2011 compared to $2,819,000 during 2010; (ii) an increase in the gain on sale of marketable equity securities to $1,937,000 during 2011 compared to $995,000 during 2010; and (iii) an increase in the share of the loss on our Mt. Hamilton project attributable to the noncontrolling shareholder to $3,591,000 during 2011 compared to $1,274,000 during 2010. Each of these items is discussed in greater detail below.   Our primary activities during 2011, 2010 and 2009 have been the (i) exploration activities to advance the Mt. Hamilton property toward the completion of a feasibility study, (ii) exploration on our mineral properties to delineate deposits to enable us to sell or joint venture the mineral property and (iii) reconnaissance exploration to locate and acquire mineral properties. During 2011 we increased our exploration efforts related to our Mt. Hamilton project and spent $3,700,000 including a $300,000 advance royalty payment and $3,400,000 in direct exploration expenditures related to Mt. Hamilton. We acquired the Mt. Hamilton project during 2010, and in 2010 we spent $1,214,000 including a $300,000 advance royalty payment and $914,000 in direct exploration expenditures related to Mt. Hamilton. We recorded a credit of $3,591,000 and $1,110,000, respectively, during 2011 and 2010 for DHI-US’s noncontrolling interest in the expenditures of MH-LLC, related to these exploration expenditures. We decreased our exploration expenditures at our South American and Mexico properties to $2,246,000 and $2,819,000, respectively, in 2011 and 2010, from $3,579,000 in 2009 partially due to the deconsolidation of PBM, as a result of which we did not include any exploration expenditures for PBM after July 21, 2010 and partially as a result of a shift in our focus to the Mt. Hamilton project. During 2011 we completed a drilling program at our Cerro Azul project in Peru. During 2011 we capitalized $2,755,000 related to our Mt. Hamilton properties, and we capitalized $10,000 related to our Jaripo and Aconchi properties in Mexico. Included in these capitalized costs was the issuance of 344,116 shares of our common stock valued at $1,000,000. During 2010 we capitalized $5,000 related to the addition of our Atico project in Peru and $6,000 related to our Norcan project in Mexico.   Our 2012 exploration expenditure budget is approximately $3,442,000 which includes approximately $1,325,000 for development costs related to Mt. Hamilton. In addition we anticipate we will spend approximately $1,675,000 for payments on leases to landowners, advance minimum royalty payments and payments to DHI-US pursuant to the MH Agreement. The primary factor in the reduction in Mt. Hamilton exploration and development expense from 2011 to 2012 relates to the completion of our Feasibility Study and related activities, including drilling and engineering design work, which occurred during 2011, and which will not be a significant part of our planned activities during 2012. Our planned activities during 2012 relate to our intention to move the Mt. Hamilton project through development activities including permitting, obtaining financing for the capital required to build the project and other engineering and project management. The future construction of Mt. Hamilton will be dependent on a number of factors including receiving permits and obtaining financing for the capital and construction. We cannot predict with certainty that we will be successful in achieving any of these goals. In addition we plan to continue to perform our early-stage planned exploration activities on our other properties and to continue reconnaissance exploration activities to acquire new properties. These exploration activities may also be modified, as necessary for changes, in joint venture funding, commodity prices and access to capital.   Exploration expense (in thousands) by property consisted of the following:       Property Name     2011     2010     Mt.

In addition, we recorded a credit of $164,000 during 2010 for Anglo’s noncontrolling interest in the losses of the consolidated subsidiary, PBM, prior to its deconsolidation on July 21, 2010. During 2011 we recorded management fees of $50,000 to PBM as a credit to exploration expense. During 2010 we recorded management fees of $47,000 to PBM, which were eliminated in consolidation, net of $11,000 of noncontrolling interest.    We believe a discussion of our general and administrative costs should be viewed without the non-cash stock option compensation expense or benefit which is discussed below. Excluding these costs, general and administrative costs were $2,160,000 during 2011 compared to $1,767,000 in 2010. We incurred salary and benefits expense of $1,300,000 during 2011 compared to $985,000 in 2010, which increased due to a bonus paid during 2011 of $245,000, and an increase in salaries during 2011 compared to 2010. We also recorded an increase in our legal and accounting costs to $305,000 during 2011 from $279,000 in 2010, due to the legal and accounting work associated with setting up the administration of MH-LLC and land matters at Mt. Hamilton and the Royalty Buy-down. In addition, other general and administrative costs including rent, travel, and insurance decreased to $238,000 during 2011 compared to $248,000 in 2010, primarily related to reduced exploration activity in South America and Mexico, continuing efforts to reduce overhead although overhead costs related to Mt. Hamilton increased. These decreases were mitigated by an increase in our shareholder relations costs to $318,000 during 2011 compared to $254,000 during 2010. We anticipate general and administrative costs will decrease in the future as a result of not spending for costs related to setting up the administration of MH-LLC and related land matters at the Mt. Hamilton project compared to what we incurred in 2011, as well as a reduction in shareholder relations costs compared to what we incurred during 2011. We have forecast 2012 general and administrative costs to be approximately $1,695,000, excluding non-cash stock option compensation expense or benefit.   We account for our employee stock options under the provisions of ASC 718. Beginning in January 1, 2011, we recognize stock option compensation expense on the date of grant for 25% of the grant date fair value, and subsequently, based upon a straight line amortization of the grant date fair value of each of its outstanding options. During the year ended December 31, 2011 we recorded $697,000 of non-cash stock option expense for the amortization of grant date fair value with a credit to additional paid-in-capital compared to $2,513,000 of non-cash stock option compensation expense during 2010. Prior to January 1, 2011, Solitario recorded a stock option liability for the vested fair value of each option grant on the measurement date by multiplying the estimated fair value determined using the Black-Scholes model by the percentage vested on the measurement date See Note 9, “Employee stock compensation plans” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for an analysis of the changes in the fair value of our outstanding stock options and the components that are used to determine the fair value.   During 2011 we recorded a loss on derivative instruments of $137,000 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $152,000 during 2010. The decrease in the gain to a loss was primarily related to an unrealized loss on our investment in Ely warrants of $180,000 during 2011 compared to a gain of $117,000 during 2010. The change in value in the Ely warrants is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and is highly dependent on the change in the price of Ely’s common stock which declined from Cdn$0.30 per share at December 31, 2010 to Cdn$0.18 per share at December 31, 2011. This loss was partially mitigated by a gain on a Kinross call we sold (and repurchased) during 2011 of $42,000. We have sold covered calls on a limited portion of our Kinross common stock that we intend to sell within one year, to enhance our return on Kinross common stock in exchange for some potential upside in those covered Kinross shares. We do not have any Kinross call options outstanding at December 31, 2011 and do not anticipate selling a material number of covered Kinross call options during 2012. See Note 6, “Derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for an analysis of the changes in our derivative instruments, and the components that are used to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments.     41     Table of Contents        We had $46,000 of depreciation and amortization expense during 2011 compared to $67,000 in 2010 primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of fully depreciated furniture and fixtures during 2011 compared to 2010. We amortize these assets over a three-year period. We anticipate our 2012 depreciation and amortization costs will be similar to our 2011 amount.   During 2011 we recorded interest expense, net of interest and dividend income, of $163,000 compared to interest and dividend income, net, of $63,000 during the same period in 2010. The increase in interest expense is primarily related to $217,000 of interest expense on our long-term debt during 2011 compared to $19,000 of interest expense on long-term debt during 2010. In addition we recorded $71,000 of interest expense related to our short-term margin loans during 2011 compared to $23,000. The increase is related to the time our margin loans were outstanding during 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011 we recorded dividend income of $98,000 compared to $103,000 during 2010 from dividends on our Kinross stock. Remaining interest income recorded during 2011 and 2010 consisted of payments on cash and cash equivalent deposit accounts. We anticipate our interest expense will increase as we continue to utilize short-term margin loans to fund a portion of our activities to supplement the sales of our Kinross common stock. However we anticipate this increase will be partially offset by an expected reduction in the interest expense related to our long-term debt as we pay down our Augusta debt. We also anticipate dividend income will continue to decrease during 2012 as we sell a portion of our Kinross common stock to fund our operations. See Note 3, “Short-term debt” and Note 4, “Long-term debt” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion of our interest expense related to our short and long-term debt.   During 2011 we sold 130,000 shares of Kinross stock for proceeds of $2,035,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $1,937,000 compared to 2010, when we sold 70,000 shares of Kinross stock for proceeds of $1,301,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $995,000. We anticipate we will continue to liquidate our holdings of Kinross stock to fund our exploration activities and our 2012 budget anticipates the sale of 360,000 shares of Kinross stock for assumed proceeds of $5,040,000 during 2012. These proceeds are significantly dependent on the quoted market price of Kinross stock on the date of sale and may be at prices significantly below our projected price.   During 2011 we recorded an income tax benefit of $635,000 compared to an income tax benefit of $1,159,000 during 2010. The reduction in our tax benefit during 2011 primarily related to the increase in our United States taxable gain on the sale of Kinross stock to $1,937,000 in 2011 compared to a gain on sale of $995,000 during 2010. In addition, we recorded a decrease in our stock option expense to $697,000 during 2011 compared to a stock option expense during 2010 of $2,513,000. Partially offsetting the increased gain on sale of marketable equity securities was an increase in our general and administrative expenses, discussed above, during 2011 compared to 2010 and by the fact that we recorded a gain on deconsolidation of our PBM subsidiary of $724,000 during 2010 and had no similar item during 2011. Although our United States exploration expense at our Mt. Hamilton project was significantly higher during 2011 compared to 2010, as discussed above, because we record minority interest credit for DHI-US’s share of those expenditures, the tax effect of the expenditures in determining our tax expense reflected in our consolidated statement of operations is also reduced.  See Note 5, “Income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion of our income tax expense and deferred income tax liability at December 31, 2011. We provide a valuation allowance for our foreign net operating losses, which are primarily related to our exploration activities in Peru, Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil. We anticipate we will continue to provide a valuation allowance for these net operating losses until we are in a net tax liability position with regards to those countries where we operate or until it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize those net operating losses in the future.   We regularly perform evaluations of our mineral property assets to assess the recoverability of our investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change which indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable utilizing guidelines based upon future net cash flows from the asset as well as our estimates of the geologic potential of early stage mineral property and its related value for future sale, joint venture or development by us or others. During 2011 we recorded $10,000 of mineral property impairments related to our Paria Cruz project in Peru, discussed below, compared to 2010 when we recorded $55,000 of mineral property impairments related to our Santiago, La Noria and Palmira projects .   Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009   We had a net loss of $4,066,000 or $0.14 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of $1,786,000 or $0.06 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2009. As explained in more detail below, the primary reasons for the increase in net loss during 2010 compared to the net loss during 2009 were (i) $1,214,000 of exploration costs on our Mt. Hamilton project; (ii) a reduction in the gain on sale of Kinross common stock to $995,000 during 2010, compared to a gain of $1,409,000 during 2009; (iii) an increase in our stock option expense to $2,513,000 during 2010       42     Table of Contents      compared to a stock option benefit of $269,000 during 2009; (iv) a reduction in our gain on derivative instruments to $152,000 during 2010 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $694,000 during 2009. Partially offsetting these items were (i) a gain on deconsolidation of PBM of $724,000 during 2010; (ii) a reduction in non-Mt. Hamilton exploration expense during 2010 to $2,819,000 compared to exploration expense of $3,579,000 during 2009 and (iii) an income tax benefit of $1,159,000 during 2010 compared to an income tax expense of $996,000 during 2009. Each of these items is discussed in greater detail below.   During 2010 we increased our exploration efforts related to our newly acquired Mt. Hamilton project and spent $1,214,000, including a $300,000 advance royalty payment and $914,000 in direct exploration expenditures related to Mt. Hamilton. We recorded a credit of $1,110,000  for DHI-US’s noncontrolling interest in the expenditures of MH-LLC, primarily related to these exploration expenditures. We decreased our exploration expenditures at our South American properties to $2,819,000, partially due to the deconsolidation of PBM, as a result of which we did not include any exploration expenditures for PBM after July 21, 2010 and partially as a result of a shift in our focus to the Mt. Hamilton project. During 2010 we capitalized $5,000 related to the addition of our Atico project in Peru and $6,000 related to our Norcan project in Mexico. During 2009 we capitalized $5,000 related to the addition of our Palmira Project.   Exploration expense (in thousands) by property consisted of the following:       Property Name     2010     2009     Mt. Hamilton     $1,214     $-     Pedra Branca     402     1,196     Cajatambo     361     413     Cerro Azul     185     65     Palmira     146     32     La Noria     139     71     Pachuca     91     111     La Promesa     40     74     Excelsior     40     3     Mercurio     36     65     Paria Cruz     26     7     Espanola     21     10     Atico     20     -     El Sello     19     -     Norcan     6     -     Bongará     6     35     Triunfo     6     5     Chonta     3     524     Newmont Alliance     1     120     La Purica     -     32     Santiago     -     3     Reconnaissance     1,271       813        Total exploration expense     $ 4,033       $ 3,579     During 2010 we recorded a credit (reduction of expense) of $1,110,000 for DHI-US’s noncontrolling interest in the losses of MH-LLC. In addition, we recorded a credit of $164,000 and $419,000, respectively, during 2010 and 2009, for Anglo’s noncontrolling interest in the losses of the consolidated subsidiary, PBM, during the year. On July 21, 2010, Anglo made a payment of $746,000 to PBM required to fund the third work program at the Pedra Branca project, which is held by PBM. Upon making this payment, Anglo earned an additional 21% interest in PBM and now holds a 51% interest in PBM. Accordingly, we have deconsolidated our interest in Pedra Branca and have recorded its 49% interest in the fair value of PBM on the date of deconsolidation as an equity investment. During 2010 we recorded management fees of $47,000 to PBM of which $36,000, net of $11,000 of noncontrolling interest, was eliminated for those fees charged prior to deconsolidation of PBM on July 21, 2010. During 2009 we recorded management fees of $65,000, to PBM, which were eliminated in consolidation, net of $19,000 of noncontrolling interest.   Excluding non-cash stock option compensation costs, discussed below, general and administrative costs were $1,767,000 during 2010 compared to $2,348,000 in 2009. We incurred salary and benefits expense of $985,000 during 2010 compared to $1,187,000 in 2009, which decreased due to a lower number of employees in our South American operations and reduced bonuses in 2010 compared to 2009. We also recorded a reduction in our legal and accounting costs to $279,000 during 2010 from $637,000 in 2009, due to the legal and accounting work associated with our attempted acquisition of Metallic      43     Table of Contents      Ventures Gold Inc. (“Metallic Ventures”) during 2009. In addition, other general and administrative costs including rent, travel, and insurance decreased to $247,000 during 2010 compared to $332,000 in 2009, primarily related to a reduction in exploration activity and continuing efforts to reduce overhead. These decreases were mitigated by a loss on currency exchange rates during 2010 of $1,000, compared to a gain of $35,000 in 2009 and an increase in our shareholder relations costs to $254,000 during 2010 compared to $223,000 during 2009.   We accounted for our employee stock options under the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, and during 2010 and 2009, we classified our stock options as liabilities as they are priced in Canadian dollars and our functional currency is United States dollars. We recorded the fair value of the vested portion of our outstanding options as a liability and record changes in the fair value as stock option compensation expense or benefit in the statement of operations in the period of the change. Upon exercise, the fair value of the options on the date of exercise, which is equal to the intrinsic value, is credited to additional paid-in capital. We estimate the fair values of the options granted using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $2,513,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense as part of general and administrative expense for the increase in the fair value of our stock option liability during 2010 compared to non-cash stock option compensation benefit of $269,000 during 2009. Our stock option compensation expense changes as a result of an increase in the market price of our common stock and additional options outstanding at the end of 2010 compared to 2009. The price of our stock as quoted on the TSX increased to Cdn$3.69 at December 31, 2010 from Cdn$2.40 at December 31, 2009. Generally as the price of our common stock increases our stock option liability and our stock option compensation expense increases and the converse is true as well. See Employee stock compensation plans in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for an analysis of the changes in the fair value of our outstanding stock options and the components that are used to determine the fair value.   During 2010 we recorded a gain on derivative instruments of $152,000 compared to a gain on derivative instruments of $694,000 during 2009. The decrease in the gain was primarily related to a reduction from unrealized gain of $522,000 during 2009 to an unrealized loss on our Kinross Collar  of $7,000 during 2010. In addition during 2009, we recorded net realized gains of $138,000 on call options on our Kinross stock compared to a realized gain of $42,000 on Kinross call options during 2010. Mitigating this decline in gain on derivative instruments was a gain of $117,000 on our Ely warrants, discussed below, during 2010 and there were no similar items in 2009. We have not designated the Kinross Collar or the Kinross call options as hedging instruments as described in ASC 815 and any changes in the fair market value of the Kinross Collar and the Kinross call options are recognized in the statement of operations in the period of the change. We have sold covered calls on a limited portion of our Kinross common stock that we intend to sell within one year, to enhance our return on Kinross common stock in exchange for some potential upside in those covered Kinross shares.   We had $67,000 of depreciation and amortization expense during 2010 compared to $91,000 in 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of fully depreciated furniture and fixtures during 2010 compared to 2009. We amortize these assets over a three-year period.   During 2010 we recorded interest and dividend income, net, of $63,000 compared to $106,000 during the same period in 2009. During 2010 we recorded dividend income of $103,000 compared to $104,000 during 2009 from dividends on our Kinross stock. The primary reason for the decrease in interest and dividend income, net, resulted from interest expense of $24,000 and $19,000, respectively, from our short and long term borrowing during 2010. The interest income recorded during 2010 and 2009 consisted of payments on cash and cash equivalent deposit accounts.   During 2010 we sold 70,000 shares of Kinross stock for proceeds of $1,301,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $995,000 compared to 2009, when we sold 100,000 shares of Kinross stock for proceeds of $1,852,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $1,409,000. We anticipate we will continue to liquidate our holdings of Kinross stock to fund our exploration activities, and our 2011 budget anticipates the sale of 275,000 shares of Kinross stock for assumed proceeds of $5,214,000 during 2011.   During 2010 we recorded an income tax benefit of $1,159,000 compared to income tax expense of $996,000 during 2009. Our tax benefit during 2010 primarily related to the increase in United States exploration expense at our Mt. Hamilton project and our stock option expense of $2,513,000 compared to a stock option benefit during 2009 of $269,000. In addition we recorded one-time break fee income of $2,200,000 related to our attempt to acquire Metallic Ventures during 2009, which increased our taxable income in 2009. Furthermore our gain on the sale of Kinross stock decreased to $995,000 in 2010 compared to a gain on sale of $1,409,000 during 2009. These were partially offset by the gain on deconsolidation of our PBM subsidiary of $724,000 recorded during 2010.   During 2010 we recorded $55,000 of mineral property impairments related to our Santiago, La Noria and Palmira projects compared to 2009 when we recorded $51,000 of mineral property impairments related to our Purica and Chonta properties.       44     Table of Contents      (d). Liquidity and Capital Resources    Short-term debt   We have borrowed $2,000,000 from UBS Bank, USA ("UBS Bank") pursuant to a secured credit line agreement between us and UBS Bank and have accrued $1,000 of unpaid interest on this debt in accounts payable. The UBS Bank credit line carries an interest rate which floats, based upon a base rate of 2.25% plus the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), which was 0.25% as of December 31, 2011. We are required to maintain minimum equity value percentages of 40% at UBS. The equity value percentage may be modified by UBS at any time. If the equity value in our account at UBS falls below the minimum, UBS may call the loan, or may sell enough Kinross shares held in our brokerage account or liquidate any other assets to restore the minimum equity value. At December 31, 2011 and March 8, 2012, the equity balance in our account at UBS was 67% and 65%, respectively. Solitario recorded interest expense related to the UBS credit line of $50,000 and $18,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.                 We also have access to short-term margin loan borrowing capacity from RBC Capital Markets, LLC (“RBC”) using our investment in Kinross stock held at RBC as collateral for the short-term margin loans. As of December 31, 2011, we have repaid all short-term margin loans previously borrowed from RBC. Subsequent to December 31, 2011, we have borrowed $500,000 against our short-term margin account. We estimate we have access to additional borrowing of approximately $1.2 million on our RBC margin loan borrowing capacity as of March 8, 2012, based upon the market value of our Kinross shares held at RBC. The previously outstanding loans carried, and the currently outstanding loan carries, interest at a margin loan rate of 4.25% per annum. The margin loan rate can be modified by RBC at any time. The margin loans are callable by RBC at any time. Per the terms of the margin loans, we are required to maintain a minimum equity value in the account of 35%, based upon the value of our Kinross shares and any other assets held at RBC, less any short-term margin loan balance and any other balances owed to RBC. The equity value percentage may be modified by RBC at any time. If the equity value in our account at RBC falls below the minimum, RBC may call the loan, or may sell enough Kinross shares held in our brokerage account or liquidate any other assets to restore the minimum equity value. At March 8, 2012, the equity balance in our account at RBC was 81%. We recorded $21,000 and $5,000, respectively, of interest expense related to the RBC short-term margin loans for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.   We are using this short-term debt as an alternative source of capital to selling our Kinross stock. We intend to continue to borrow money for the next year or longer using our Kinross common stock as collateral to defer potential current United States income taxes if we were to sell our Kinross common stock in excess of our anticipated United States tax deductible expenses for the entire year of 2012, which consist primarily of United States general and administrative costs and a portion of our costs to develop the Mt. Hamilton project in Nevada. We anticipate the proceeds from the sale of Kinross common stock sold during 2012 will not exceed our anticipated United States tax deductible expenses, and accordingly, we do not anticipate having any currently payable United States income taxes for 2012. We anticipate proceeds from the sale of shares of Kinross common stock and proceeds from any loans against our investment in Kinross stock will provide adequate funds for our operations through the end of 2012.  Our use of short-term borrowing is not considered critical to our liquidity, capital resources or credit risk strategies. We consider the use of short-term borrowing as a component of our overall strategy to potentially maximize our after-tax returns on the sale of our investment in Kinross stock. We currently intend to repay the short-term debt with proceeds from the sale of Kinross stock in the future. Our maximum amount of short-term borrowing was $3,875,000, including accrued interest, during the year ended December 31, 2011. Our average short-term borrowing during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2,466,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2011, we borrowed an additional $500,000and as of March 8, 2012, we have a total of $2,500,000 outstanding under short-term margin loans.   Long-term debt   In connection with the formation of MH-LLC, the Mt. Hamilton properties contributed by DHI-US to MH-LLC are subject to a security interest granted to Augusta to secure a debt obligation related to Ely’s acquisition of the Mt. Hamilton project. Pursuant to the MH Agreement, as part of our earn-in, we agreed to make payments totaling $3,750,000, of which $1,250,000is  to be paid in cash to DHI-US and of which $2,500,000 is  to be made as private placement investments in Ely common stock, detailed below, all to provide Ely with the funds necessary for Ely to make the loan payments due to Augusta, which loan payment obligations are secured by the mining claims currently owned by MH-LLC. During 2011 we made a $500,000 payment on the Augusta debt, and the total remaining payments as of December 31, 2011 are $3,250,000. Failure to make any of the payments to DHI-US or investments in Ely necessary to provide Ely with the funds necessary for Ely to make the required payments due to Augusta may result in the loss of all of our interest in the Mt. Hamilton project. The payments due to Augusta are non-interest bearing. Accordingly, upon the contribution of the mineral properties by DHI-US to MH-LLC, MH-LLC recorded $3,066,000 for the discounted fair value of the payments due to Augusta, discounted at 7.5%, which was       45     Table of Contents       based on our estimated cost of similar credit as of the formation of MH-LLC. As a result of earning an 80% interest in MH-LLC on the completion of the Feasibility Study, pursuant to the terms of the MH Agreement, we no longer have the right to opt-out of the payments due to Augusta.   Schedule of debt payments due to Augusta as of December 31, 2011:     Date     Amount     June 1, 2012     $750,000     June 1, 2013     750,000     June 1, 2014     750,000     June 1,2015     1,000,000     Discount     (448,000 )     Net due     2,802,000     Less current portion     727,000       Net long-term debt     $ 2,075,000     During the year ended December 31, 2011, Solitario made a $500,000 payment of principal on the long-term debt to DHI-US, which in turn was paid to Augusta. During 2011 and 2010, Solitario recorded $217,000 and $19,000, respectively, for accretion of interest expense related to MH-LLC long-term debt due to Augusta.   Joint venture and delay rental payments   In the past, we have financed our activities through the sale of our properties, joint venture arrangements, the sale of our securities and from the sale of our marketable equity security investment in Kinross. We received $200,000, each year respectively, from joint venture payments during 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to delay rental payments on our Bongará project, discussed above, and  during 2011 we received a $50,000 delay rental joint venture payment on our Mercurio project in Peru, which was partially offset by $8,000, the entire capitalized value of Mercurio at the time of the payment. Receipts from joint venture payments previously occurred during the years from 1996 through 2000 and the sale of properties last occurred in 2000 upon the sale of our Yanacocha property for $6,000,000.  Per our agreements with both Votorantim on Bongará and Regent on Mercurio, the joint venture partners may terminate the agreements at any time, and will not be required to make further delay rental payments if they terminate the agreements. Our agreement with Votorantim on our Bongará project calls for annual delay rental payments of $200,000 until Votorantim provides notice that it has made certain minimum expenditures or makes a decision to place the project in production or decides to drop the project. We expect future revenues from joint venture payments and from the sale of properties, if any, would occur on an infrequent basis.   Investment in marketable equity securities   Our marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon market quotes of the underlying securities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we owned 850,000 and 980,000 shares of Kinross common stock, respectively. The Kinross shares are recorded at their fair market value of $9,690,000 and $18,581,000 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. In addition we own other marketable equity securities with a fair value of $671,000 and $1,190,000 as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Our investments in marketable equity securities are based upon market quotes on the NYSE and the TSXV. At December 31, 2011, we have classified $4,361,000 of our marketable equity securities as a short-term asset. Changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities are recorded as gains and losses in other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a loss in other comprehensive income on marketable equity securities of $9,425,000, less related deferred tax expense of $3,516,000.   During the year ended December 31, 2011 we sold 130,000 shares of Kinross stock for proceeds of $2,035,000 resulting in a gain of $1,937,000 which was transferred, less related deferred tax expense of $722,000, from previously unrealized gain on marketable equity securities in other comprehensive income. We also own (i) 1,000,000 shares of TNR Gold Corp. that are recorded at their fair market value of $54,000 at December 31, 2011; (ii) 250,000 shares of International Lithium Corporation that are recorded at their fair market of $28,000 at December 31, 2011 and (iii) 3,333,333 shares of Ely that are recorded at their fair market value of $588,000, all of which are classified as marketable equity securities available for sale.   Any change in the market value of the shares of Kinross common stock could have a material impact on our liquidity and capital resources. The price of shares of Kinross common stock has varied from a high of $18.60 per share to a low of $11.14 per share during the year ended December 31, 2011.       46     Table of Contents      Kinross Collar and Kinross Calls    Kinross Collar   On October 12, 2007, we entered into a Zero-Premium Equity Collar (the "Kinross Collar") pursuant to a Master Agreement for Equity Collars and a Pledge and Security Agreement with UBS whereby we pledged 900,000 shares of Kinross common shares to be sold (or delivered back to us with any differences settled in cash). On April 12, 2011, the final tranche of 100,000 shares under the Kinross Collar were released upon the expiration of that tranche of the Kinross Collar. As of December 31, 2011, no shares are subject to the Kinross Collar.   Kinross Calls   Beginning in December 2008, we sold covered calls covering our shares of Kinross common stock. We sold three covered calls covering 130,000 shares of Kinross common stock during 2009, of which 50,000 of these call options expired unexercised in April 2009, 40,000 were repurchased in July 2009 and 40,000 were repurchased in November 2009. In November 2009, we sold an option for 40,000 shares which expired in May 2010. In September 2011, we sold options covering 65,000 shares for proceeds of $57,000, which were repurchased in October 2011 for $15,000 and we recorded a gain of $42,000 in loss (gain) on derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2011, we have no outstanding covered calls covering our investment in Kinross common stock.   The business purpose of the Kinross Collar was to provide downside price protection for our investment in Kinross. In consideration for obtaining this price protection, we had given up the upside appreciation above the upper threshold price of the Kinross Collar. Our risk management policy related to our investment in the Kinross Collar was to reduce the potential price risk on assets which represented a significant proportion of total assets, where economically feasible. The business purpose of the Kinross calls was to lock in a specific price on a portion of the Kinross shares we intended to sell within the next year. We will continue to look toward other Kinross risk management options to meet our risk management policy. These alternatives include the use of short-term margin loans, discussed above, listed options, use of covered calls and sale of the investment. The use of these Kinross risk management strategies reduces the potential of paying significant taxes on a near term sale of the entire investment in Kinross shares based upon both (i) the projected future needs for the use of funds from any sales of the investment in Kinross shares and (ii) the potential generation of future United States net operating losses which could be used to offset any taxable gains on future sale of the investment in Kinross shares. We have not designated the Kinross Collar or Kinross calls as hedging instruments as described in ASC 815 and any changes in the fair market value of the Kinross Collar or the Kinross calls are recognized in the statement of operations in the period of the change.   Income taxes   As a result of the United States federal and state net operating loss generated during 2011, which we may carry back to 2010, we have recorded a receivable for an income tax refund of approximately $275,000, which was received in February 2012. See Note 5, “Income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information.   Working capital   We had working capital of $345,000 at December 31, 2011 compared to working capital of $134,000 as of December 31, 2010. Our working capital at December 31, 2011 consists of our cash and equivalents and marketable equity securities, primarily consisting of the current portion of our investment in 850,000 shares of Kinross common stock of $4,361,000, less our short-term margin loans of $2,000,000 and current deferred income taxes of $1,627,000 related to our planned sales of Kinross common stock during the next year. We intend to liquidate a limited portion of our Kinross shares over the next year, in order to continue to defer current United States income taxes on the sale of shares of Kinross common stock. We also intend to continue to borrow on margin at RBC and on our UBS Bank secured credit line. We will continue to monitor our exposure to a single asset, taking into consideration our cash and liquidity requirements, tax implications, the market price of gold and the market price of Kinross stock. We have budgeted the anticipated sale of 360,000 shares of Kinross stock during 2012 for assumed proceeds of $5,040,000. Any funds received from the sale of our Kinross shares or borrowing against the value of our Kinross shares would be used primarily to fund exploration and development on our existing properties, for the acquisition and exploration of new properties and general working capital.   Cash and cash equivalents were $432,000 as of December 31, 2011 compared to $478,000 at December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, our cash balances along with our investment in marketable equity securities and our UBS Bank credit line are considered adequate to fund our expected expenditures over the next year, including our planned 2012 development and payment obligations related to MH-LLC and the Mt. Hamilton project.       47     Table of Contents      The nature of the mining exploration business requires significant sources of capital to fund exploration, development and operation of mining projects. We will need additional resources to fund our long-term payment obligations associated with MH-LLC, develop the Mt. Hamilton project on our own and explore any mineral deposits we have. We anticipate that we would finance these activities through the use of joint venture arrangements, the issuance of debt or equity, the sale of interests in our properties or the sale of our shares of Kinross common stock. There can be no assurance that a combination of such sources of funds will be available in the quantity or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.   Stock-based compensation plans   During the year ended December 31, 2011, 150,600 options were exercised for proceeds of $247,000 and no options were granted from the 2006 Plan. During the year ended December 31, 2010, no options were exercised from the 2006 Plan and we granted 2,065,000 options from the 2006 Plan. None of our outstanding options from the 2006 Plan expire during 2012. We do not expect a significant number of our vested options from the 2006 Plan will be exercised in the next year. See Note 9, “Employee stock compensation plans” to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a summary of the activity for stock options outstanding under the 2006 Plan as of December 31, 2011.   Off-balance sheet arrangements   As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.                                          (e). Cash Flows   Net cash used in operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to $7,931,000 compared to $5,440,000 for 2010 primarily as a result of (i) an increase in exploration expenses to $5,946,000 in 2011 compared to $4,033,000 in 2010, primarily related to an increase in exploration expenditures at our Mt. Hamilton project to $3,700,000 during 2011 compared to exploration expenditures of $1,214,000 at Mt. Hamilton during 2010; (ii); an increase in non-stock option general and administrative costs to $2,160,000 during 2011 compared to non-stock option general and administrative costs of $1,767,000and (iii) the net payment of $119,000 of accounts payable during 2011 compared to the net increase of $414,000 of accounts payable during 2010. These increased uses of cash were mitigated by an increase in joint venture property payments to $242,000 during 2011 compared to $200,000 during 2010. The remaining uses of cash for operations were comparable in 2011 and 2010.   Net cash provided from (used in) investing activities increased to $193,000 cash provided during 2011 compared to ($324,000) cash used during the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily related to (i) an increase in the proceeds from the sale of Kinross common stock to $2,035,000 during 2011 compared with $1,301,000 proceeds from the sale of Kinross stock in 2010. During 2011 we sold 130,000 shares of Kinross at an average price of $15.65 compared to the sale of 70,000 shares of Kinross during 2010 at an average price of $18.59; (ii) no effect on cash during 2011 from the deconsolidation of PBM compared to a decrease in cash of $1,083,000 from the deconsolidation of PBM during 2010; and (iii) the purchase during 2010 of the Ely units for $493,000 consisting of 3,333,333 shares of Ely common stock and warrants for 1,666,667 shares of Ely common stock. These increases in cash provided by investing activities between 2011 and 2010 were partially offset by the use of cash for additions to mineral property of $1,765,000 during 2011 compared to additions to mineral property of $11,000 during 2010. The remaining uses of cash from investing activities were comparable in 2011 and 2010.             Net cash provided from financing activities increased to $7,692,000 during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $4,296,000 during 2010. The primary reason for the increase in cash provided from financing activities in 2011 was related to the equity offering, discussed above under recent developments which provided $8,937,000 in cash during 2011 and no similar financing was completed during 2010. The increase in cash provided by this financing was partially offset by reductions in cash provided during 2011 for short-term borrowing and from contributions from noncontrolling interests compared to 2010.   (f). Development Activities, Exploration Activities, Environmental Compliance and Contractual Obligations    Development Activities   With the completion of the Feasibility Study on February 22, 2012, we are now entering the development stage of the Mt. Hamilton project. The development of the Mt. Hamilton project, if it occurs, will entail a significant capital investment,      48     Table of Contents      which is estimated in the Feasibility Study to be $71.9 million. We currently do not have the funds for the estimated $71.9 million capital investment to develop the Mt. Hamilton project. The funding for the full development will require significant additional capital which we anticipate may come from the liquidation of our investment in Kinross, additional issuance of our common stock, equipment leasing, debt and commodity stream financing, none of which is currently in place to adequately fund the required capital investment. We cannot provide any assurance that such capital will be available in sufficient amounts, if at all. If we develop the Mt. Hamilton deposit, we will be responsible for reclamation of the Mt. Hamilton project at the completion of mining. In addition we are required to make certain annual claim payments on our mineral property at Mt. Hamilton and to make payments to DHI-US, Ely and to certain other underlying leaseholders at Mt. Hamilton to maintain our ownership of MH-LLC and the Mt. Hamilton project. These obligations are detailed below under “Contractual Obligations.” If we fail to make any of these payments we may lose some or all of our interest in MH-LLC and/or the Mt. Hamilton project.   Exploration Activities   A significant part of our business involves the review of potential property acquisitions and continuing review and analysis of properties in which we have an interest, to determine the exploration and development potential of the properties. In analyzing expected levels of expenditures for work commitments and property payments, our obligations to make such payments fluctuate greatly depending on whether, among other things, we make a decision to sell a property interest, convey a property interest to a joint venture, or allow our interest in a property to lapse by not making the work commitment or payment required. In acquiring our interests in mining claims and leases, we have entered into agreements, which generally may be canceled at our option. We are required to make minimum rental and option payments in order to maintain our interest in certain claims and leases. Our net 2011 mineral and surface property rental and option payments included in exploration expense, not including $300,000 of advance royalty payments related to Mt. Hamilton, were $287,000. In 2012 we estimate our net exploration property rentals and option payments for properties we own or operate, excluding Mt. Hamilton, to be approximately $860,000, assuming that our joint ventures continue in their current status and that we do not appreciably change our property positions on existing properties, we estimate that our joint venture partners will reimburse approximately $665,000 of these annual payments. These obligations are detailed below under “Contractual Obligations.” In addition, we may be required to make further payments in the future if we elect to exercise our options under those agreements or if we enter into new agreements.   Environmental Compliance   We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. We are required to obtain permits in advance of completing certain of our exploration activities, to monitor and report on certain activities to appropriate authorities, and to perform remediation of environmental disturbance as a result of certain of our activities. Historically, the nature of our activities of review, acquisition and exploration of properties prior to the establishment of reserves, which may include mapping, sampling, geochemistry and geophysical studies, as well as some limited exploration drilling, has not resulted in significant environmental impacts in the past. We have historically carried on our required environmental remediation expenditures and activities, if any, concurrently with our exploration activities and expenditures. The expenditures to comply with our environmental obligations are included in our exploration expenditures in the statement of operations and have not been material to our capital or exploration expenditures, and have not had a material effect on our competitive position. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we have not capitalized any costs related to environmental control facilities. We do not anticipate our other, non-Mt. Hamilton project, exploration activities will result in any material new or additional environmental expenditures or liabilities in the near future.   Our planned development activities will increase our environmental expenditures in the event we complete the development of the Mt. Hamilton project, which entails among other things, building a mine, building and operating an open pit, an ore processing plant and leach pads and other similar activities. Prior to mining development activities, substantial reclamation and mine closure bonds to the federal and state regulatory agencies must be put in place and are dependent on, among other things, receiving required permits and obtaining necessary financing. None of which are in place currently; please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I, above. We do not expect any of these additional environmental expenditures within the next year.   Contractual Obligations   The following table provides an analysis of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011:       49     Table of Contents            (in thousands)     As of December 31, 2011 Payments due by period     -     Total     Less than 1 year     1-3 years     3-5 years     More than 5 years     Operating Lease Obligations     $65     $65     $-     $-     $-     Short-term margin loan (1)     2,001     2,001     -     -     -     Land holding costs (2)     205     205     -     -     -     Mt.

(2). Excluding Mt. Hamilton, discussed below, our other land holding contractual obligations, net of expected joint venture reimbursements of$655,000. Our non-Mt. Hamilton land holding agreements are generally cancelable at our option and this amount includes all required net land payments for the next 12 months to maintain our existing mineral properties.  (3) Mt. Hamilton land holding costs have been shown through 2017 and included $32,000 of annual unpatented mining claim fees, minimum cash stand-by royalty and land payments and required minimum royalty payments of 33 ounces of gold per year in 2016 and 2017, valued at $1,566 per ounce, the closing price of an ounce of gold at December 31, 2011, quoted on kitco.com. (4) Pursuant to the MH Agreement, we have agreed to make the following payments as part of our earn-in upon completion of the Feasibility Study: We have agreed to (i) make payments totaling $750,000 to DHI-US, to enable Ely to make payments in satisfaction of the Augusta long-term debt and make payments totaling $300,000 and deliver 50,000 shares of Solitario common stock to DHI-US by August 23, 2012 (the “Phase I earn-in”), of which $150,000 was paid and 25,000 shares of our stock was delivered in February 2012. We have further agreed to (i) invest $300,000 into MH-LLC for an advance royalty payment to the underlying royalty holder, and (ii) make payments totaling $500,000 to DHI-US and deliver 100,000 shares of Solitario common stock to DHI-US by August 23, 2013(the Phase II earn-in”). Finally, we have agreed to (i) invest $600,000 into MH-LLC for an advance royalty payment to the underlying royalty holder; (ii) make payments totaling $500,000 to DHI-US and deliver 100,000 shares of Solitario common stock to DHI-US by August 23, 2014; and (iii) buy down the existing 8% net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty to a 3% NSR royalty by paying the underlying royalty holder $5,000,000 by November 19, 2014 (the “Phase III earn-in”). If we fail to make any of the payments prior to the completion of Phase I earn-in we will forfeit our entire interest in MH-LLC. If we fail to make any of the payments after the completion of Phase I earn-in, our interest in MH-LLC will be reduced to 49% and DHI-US’s interest will be increased to 51%. (5) The commitment value of the shares of Solitario stock to be paid to DHI-US, discussed above in note (4) to this table, have been valued at $1.43 per share, the December 31, 2011 ending stock price as quoted on the NYSE Amex. (6) The minimum annual advance royalty payments of $300,000 per year have been included in this table through December 2017, in addition to a $3,500,000 royalty buy-down discussed above due in November 2013 and a $1,500,000 royalty buy-down payment due in November 2014.  (7) Includes unamortized discount as of December 31, 2011; see “Long-term debt” above. Of these payments, $1,250,000 will be made in cash to DHI-US, discussed above in note 4 to this table, and $2,500,000 of these payments will be made to Ely, in the form of private placements for Ely common stock, of $750,000 in June 2013, $750,000 in June 2014, and $1,000,000 in June 2015, as further discussed below in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, “Ely Gold investment and the Mt. Hamilton Joint Venture” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”    (g). Joint Ventures, Royalty and the Strategic Alliance properties   The following discussion relates to an analysis of our exploration and potential development plans for our major properties as of December 31, 2011. Please also see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, “Mineral Properties” in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and our discussion of our properties under Item 2, “Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of all of our mineral properties.   Mt Hamilton joint venture   The Mt. Hamilton gold property, located in east-central Nevada, is currently the most important project in the Company and is our primary focus for 2012. With the completion of the Feasibility Study in February 2012, we have now earned an 80% interest in the property. It is our only property with proven and probable reserves. Our initial participation in the Mt. Hamilton property began in August 2010, when we signed a Letter of Intent with Ely Gold to earn up to an 80% interest. In December 2010, we entered into the definitive MH Agreement with DHI-US, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ely Gold, with respect to MH-LLC, a limited liability company, that now holds the Mt. Hamilton project assets.   We are the manager of all project activities. The most important objectives for the remainder of 2012 are the filing of a Plan of Operations with the US Department of Agriculture - Forest Service and advancing the environmental studies necessary to move the project into construction and production. As part of the permitting process, we will undertake public scoping meetings to define potential concerns and develop mitigation plans to address issues identified by all stakeholders,      50     Table of Contents      which includes the public, county, state, and federal regulatory agencies, and Native American input. Prior to the scoping process and consultancy with the regulatory agencies, it is not possible to predict the timetable to complete permitting.   In addition to the permitting activities, we are also planning a drilling program to convert mineralization to proven and probable reserves. This drilling will occur mainly along the eastern and southern margins of the currently defined Centennial ore body, but some drilling in the previously mined Seligman area may also be undertaken.   We have budgeted approximately $3,000,000 for permitting activities, planned development, land and earn-in payments for 2012 at Mt. Hamilton.   Bongará   The Bongará project is an advanced-stage high-grade zinc project in Peru. Based on extensive exploration and development work conducted to date, we believe the property has excellent potential to be developed into a mine over the next several years. In August 2006 we signed a Letter Agreement with Votorantim Metais (“Votorantim”), granting Votorantim the right to earn up to a 70% interest in the project by meeting certain spending and development milestones. Votorantim is funding and managing all work conducted on the project. The Bongará project hosts the Florida Canyon zinc deposit, where high-grade zinc mineralization has been encountered in drill holes over an area approximately 2.0 kilometers by 2.0 kilometers in dimension.   For 2012, permitting has been initiated to construct a new tunnel to provide underground access and drilling platforms in the Karen-Milagros zone of the Florida Canyon deposit. Tunneling is scheduled to begin in late 2012 or early 2013. Ongoing work in 2012 includes additional metallurgical testing, and other pre-feasibility activities in preparation for completion of a full feasibility report in 2013. Additionally, 20,000 meters of drilling to further define mineralization is planned in 2012 from both the surface at San Jorge and Karen-Milagros and the existing underground workings at San Jorge. Votorantim will also continue road construction to the project area with the objective of completing access to the Florida Canyon area late in the year. To date, access to the deposit has occurred via helicopter and foot trails. Permitting and social development activities with surrounding communities will also continue throughout 2012.   Pedra Branca              The Pedra Branca project is an advanced-stage project in which we are exploring for platinum and palladium (“PGM”) in Brazil. Several well mineralized bodies containing strong values of PGM’s have been delineated by drilling. We believe there is good potential to discover additional PGM-bearing deposits. The property is 100% owned by PBM. Our joint venture partner, Anglo Platinum (“Anglo”), currently owns 51% of PBM and is funding, through PBM, all work conducted on the project. We hold a 49% interest in PBM. We deconsolidated PBM during 2010 and will record our share of any exploration expense as our equity interest in the gains and losses of PBM against its investment in PBM. As part of the Shareholders Agreement, PBM has paid us a 5% management fee for operating the project based upon total expenditures, pursuant to a Services Agreement. Anglo has indicated they will be taking over the management of the project during the second quarter of 2012, and we will no longer be receiving the 5% management fee.   The work program for 2012 consists of helicopter-borne geophysics on closely spaced flight lines traversing areas potentially underlain by ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks are highly magnetic and detectable by geophysics. Ultramafic rocks are also the host to all PGM mineralization identified on the property to date. Anglo has indicated additional work will be conducted on re-logging selected drill core to better interpret the geology and geometry of the mineralization. If the geophysical program is successful in identifying new ultramafic bodies, Anglo has indicated PBM may drill test these areas in 2013.   Pachuca Real   The Pachuca project located in central Mexico is an early-stage exploration project in which we are exploring for silver and gold. We believe the project has excellent potential to host multiple high-grade silver-gold veins over a fairly large area. In April 2010, Solitario signed a definitive venture agreement with Compania De Minas Buenaventura S.A.A. (“Buenaventura”), allowing Buenaventura to earn up to a 70% interest in the property by meeting certain expenditure and development milestones. In 2011, Buenaventura completed a 38-hole core drilling program totaling 13,489 meters. In December 2011, Buenaventura elected to terminate its option to earn an interest in the property, and consequently, Solitario retains a 100% interest.       51     Table of Contents      Our initial plans for 2012 are to evaluate the extensive work program that Buenaventura completed and we will probably seek a new joint venture partner later in the year. Absent securing a venture partner in 2012, we are considering conducting a follow-up drilling program in 2013 offsetting some of the well mineralized Buenaventura drill holes.   Newmont Alliance   In January 2005 we signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the "Alliance Agreement") with Newmont Overseas Exploration Limited ("Newmont"), to explore for gold in South America (the "Strategic Alliance"). We currently have the La Promesa, Excelsior and Cerro Azul properties that fall within the currently defined Strategic Alliance areas and are subject to the provisions of the Newmont Alliance. All three properties are considered early-stage exploration properties.   In 2011 we drilled 11 core holes at Cerro Azul and intersected mineralization in seven of the holes. We believe there is potential on all three of the Strategic Alliance properties, but as we are currently focused on higher priority projects, we plan to conduct very limited activities on these in 2012.   Yanacocha Royalty Property             The 61,000-hectare Yanacocha royalty property is located in northern Peru immediately north of Newmont Mining-Buenaventura's Minera Yanacocha Mine, the largest gold mine in South America. We acquired the property in 1993 and sold it to Newmont in 2000 for $6.0 million and we retained a net smelter return ("NSR") royalty on the property. We amended the NSR royalty schedule in January 2005 at which time Newmont committed to a long-term US$4.0 million work program on our royalty property. We consider the property to be an early-stage exploration property, but believe it has good potential to host gold mineralization. Newmont continues to conduct annual exploration work on the property, and we see this work continuing for the foreseeable future.   (h). Wholly-owned Exploration Properties   Jaripo   In December 2011 we optioned the 775-hectare Jaripo silver-zinc-lead-gold project in Sonora, Mexico, from a private Mexican individual. We can acquire a 100% interest in the property without any retained royalty due the underlying owner, by making scheduled option payments of $225,000 over the next three years, and a final payment of $1.75 million in December 2015.   The property is characterized by a vein system that has been traced over a length of 1,500 meters. Another company drilled 12 core holes totaling 1,503 meters in 2010. All the drill holes, except one, intersected mineralization. Since optioning the property, we have conducted detailed surface sampling and mapping. We believe the property has the potential to host significant silver-zinc-lead-gold mineralization in veins, is underexplored and will be relatively inexpensive to drill test. We are planning a 10-hole drilling program in 2012.   Other Properties   For Peru and Mexico, we have budgeted approximately $2,117,000 in 2012 for exploration on our wholly-owned projects, our Newmont Strategic Alliance projects, discussed above, and reconnaissance exploration activities for 2012. This amount  includes approximately $266,000 for drilling related expenditures for the Jaripo property in 2012. These activities include mapping, sampling, geophysical and geochemical analysis in addition to our drilling activities. Our significant wholly-owned projects include Atico in Peru, Jaripo, Aconchi and Norcan in Mexico, and Triunfo and Espanola in Bolivia.   (i). Discontinued Projects   During 2011 we abandoned the Paria Cruz project and recorded a mineral property write-down of $10,000. During 2010 we abandoned the Santiago, Cajatambo, La Noria and Palmira properties and recorded a mineral property write down of $16,000, $28,000, $6,000 and $5,000, respectively. We performed drilling, stream sediment sampling, rock chip channel sampling and reconnaissance geological mapping. Based upon this work, the decision was made to abandon these projects,.   (j). Critical Accounting Estimates   Mineral Properties, net       52     Table of Contents      We classify our interest in mineral properties as Mineral Properties, net (tangible assets) pursuant to ASC 930. On February 22, 2012, we announced the completion of the Feasibility Study, and as a result we earned an 80% interest in MH-LLC, and we reported the mineral reserves as of February 22, 2012 at our Mt. Hamilton project, discussed above. The majority of our mineral properties represents mineral use rights for parcels of land we do not own. Except for Mt. Hamilton, all of our mineral properties are located in Latin America, and relate to exploration stage properties. The value of these assets is primarily driven by the nature and amount of economic minerals believed to be contained, or potentially contained, in such properties.   Impairment   We regularly perform evaluations of our investment in mineral properties to assess the recoverability and/or the residual value of our  investments in these assets. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances change, such as negative drilling results or termination of a joint venture, which indicates the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, utilizing established guidelines based upon discounted future net cash flows from the asset or upon the determination that certain exploration properties do not have sufficient potential for economic mineralization as a result of our analysis of exploration or development activities including surveys, sampling and drilling.   Fair Value   ASC 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC 820 also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:   Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 : Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability; or Level 3 : Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.   The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.   Marketable equity securities   Our investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, which is based upon quoted prices of the securities owned. The cost of marketable equity securities sold is determined by the specific identification method. Changes in market value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity, unless a decline in market value is considered other than temporary, in which case the decline is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statement of operations.   Ely units and warrants   In connection with the LOI, we purchased 3,333,333 Ely units in two equal tranches consisting each of 1,666,666 shares of Ely common stock and warrants to purchase 833,333 shares of Ely common stock received on August 30, 2010 (the “First Tranche”). The second tranche was received on October 19, 2010 (the “Second Tranche”). The Ely common stock and any underlying shares to be received upon exercise of the warrants were subject to a four-month hold period from the date the units were purchased.   We allocated the purchase price of the units for both tranches between the shares of Ely common stock and the warrants based upon the relative fair values of the warrants and shares in the units on the dates of purchase. The fair value of the shares of Ely common stock was based upon the quoted market value of Ely shares as quoted on the TSXV. The fair value of the Ely warrants was based upon a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We did not discount these fair values for the four-month hold period because of our classification of these assets as long-term based upon our intent to hold the shares and any shares from the potential exercise of the warrants for a period of more than one year and because the relatively short hold period was not considered to create a material discount to our value as of the date of purchase of the units. We recorded a day-one unrealized gain on the Ely marketable equity securities, net of deferred taxes, to other comprehensive income, based upon the quoted fair market value of the Ely shares on the date of purchase. We classify our      53     Table of Contents      shares of Ely common stock as marketable equity securities available for sale and any unrealized gains or losses are recognized in unrealized gain or loss on marketable equity securities in other comprehensive income.   Pursuant to ASC 815 the warrants received in both tranches do not qualify as a derivative instrument until 31 days prior to the end of the hold period. Accordingly we recorded a day-one unrealized gain to other comprehensive income on the Ely warrants as of the date of purchase for both tranches. However, on November 30, 2010, the date the hold period for the potential shares from warrants from the First Tranche was less than 31 days, we changed the classification of the warrants received on August 30, 2010 to derivative instrument and concurrently transferred the unrealized gain on the warrants as of that date of $62,000, net of deferred taxes of $37,000, to unrealized gain on derivative instrument in the statement of operations to reflect the change in the classification of the warrants received in the First Tranche as deferred instruments on that date. Solitario recorded an additional gain on derivative instruments of $17,000, for a total gain on derivative instruments in the statement of operations since the date of acquisition of $117,000. The fair value of the warrants was calculated based upon a Black-Scholes option pricing model at each period end date.   Because the warrants received in the Second Tranche did not qualify as derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010 we recorded all changes in value of the warrants during 2010 in unrealized gain in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. We transferred the balance of unrealized gain in other comprehensive income to gain on derivative instrument in the statement of operations, when the warrants were reclassified as derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815 in January 2011.   Derivative instruments   We account for our derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." Pursuant to ASC 815, we have not designated the Kinross Collar or the Kinross call options as hedging instruments and any changes in the fair market value of the Kinross Collar or the Kinross call options are recognized in the statement of operations in the period of the change. See results of operations above for the loss (gain) on derivative instrument related to the Kinross Collar and the Kinross call options during 2011 and 2010.   Revenue Recognition   We record delay rental payments as revenue in the period received. We received $200,000 in delay rental payments during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Any payments received for the sale of property interests are recorded as a reduction of the related property's capitalized cost. Proceeds which exceed the capitalized cost of the property are recognized as revenue. During 2011 we recorded $42,000 in joint venture and property payments related to a $50,000 payment on our Mercurio project, less $8,000 for the entire capitalized cost at Mercurio at the time of the payment.   Deferred Noncontrolling Shareholder Payments   We record any proceeds from parties earning an interest in subsidiaries as deferred noncontrolling shareholder payments until the party earns an interest in the subsidiary. Upon earning an initial or subsequent interest in the subsidiary by the other party, we record noncontrolling interest equal to the earned percentage interest in the net book value of the subsidiary and any difference between the proceeds recorded in deferred noncontrolling interest is recorded as additional paid-in-capital. In the event the parties do not earn either an initial interest or a subsequent interest in the subsidiary, we record any payments included in deferred noncontrolling shareholder payments to the statement of operations.   Long-term debt   We record the long-term debt due to Augusta at the discounted fair value as of the date of the formation of MH-LLC in accordance with ASC 470. Upon the contribution of the mineral properties by DHI-US to MH-LLC, MH-LLC recorded $3,066,000 for the discounted fair value of the payments due to Augusta, discounted at 7.5%, which was based on our estimated cost of similar credit as of the formation of MH-LLC.   Stock-based compensation   Solitario classifies its options as equity options, in accordance with ASU 2010-13 and no longer records a liability for the fair value of its outstanding options beginning January 1, 2011. In accordance with ASU 2010-13, this change has been made on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2011 with a reduction to stock option liability of $2,775,000, an increase to additional paid-in-capital of $1,240,000 and a reduction in accumulated deficit of $992,000, net of deferred taxes of $543,000 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The adoption of ASU 2010-13 had the effect of increasing the 2011 net      54     Table of Contents      loss and basic and diluted earnings per share by $524,000 and $0.02 per share, respectively, by no longer accounting for its options as liabilities. See Note 9, to the consolidated financial statements, “Employee stock compensation plans” below.   Income taxes   We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Under ASC 740, income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred taxes also are recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future taxable income and income taxes, respectively. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Currently we believe our deferred tax assets, exclusive of our foreign net operating losses and our Yanacocha royalty asset, are recoverable. Recovery of these assets is dependent upon our expected gains on the Kinross securities we own. If these values are not realized, we may record additional valuation allowances in the future.   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes    ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. ASC 740 provides that a company's tax position will be considered settled if the taxing authority has completed its examination, the company does not plan to appeal, and it is remote that the taxing authority would reexamine the tax position in the future. The adoption of ASC 740-10 had no effect on our financial position or results of operations.   (k). Related Party Transactions   TNR Gold Corp.   As of December 31, 2011, we own 1,000,000 shares of TNR that are classified as marketable equity securities available-for-sale and are recorded at their fair market value of $54,000 at December 31, 2011. Christopher E. Herald, our CEO, was a member of the Board of Directors of TNR until June 3, 2009.   (l). Recent Accounting Pronouncements    	In April 2010 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010-13, “Effect of Denominating the Exercise Price of a Share-Based Payment Award in the Currency of the Market in Which the Underlying Equity Security Trades” (“ASU 2010-13”). ASU 2010-13 addresses the classification of a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades. FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718 was amended to clarify that a share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity’s equity securities trade shall not be considered to contain a market, performance or service condition. Therefore, such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies for equity classification. The amendments in ASU 2010-13 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early application permitted. Solitario changed its accounting for options upon the adoption of ASU 2010-13 from liability accounting to equity accounting in the first quarter of 2011. In accordance with ASU 2010-13, this change has been made on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2011 with a reduction to stock option liability of $2,775,000, an increase to additional paid-in-capital of $1,240,000 and a reduction in accumulated deficit of $992,000, net of deferred taxes of $543,000. See “Employee stock compensation plans” below as discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.   In January 2010 ASC guidance for fair value measurements and disclosure was updated to require additional disclosures related to transfers in and out of level 1 and 2 fair value measurements and enhanced detail in the level 3 reconciliation. The guidance was amended to clarify the level of disaggregation required for assets and liabilities and the disclosures required for inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities that fall in either level 2 or level 3. The updated guidance was effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2010, with the exception of the level 3 disaggregation, which is effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2011. The adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See the discussion of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value above under “Fair Value.”       55     Table of Contents      Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   (a)                  Equity Price Risks   (1) Our investment in Kinross is subject to equity market risk.   As of December 31, 2011 a hypothetical increase of  10 percent in the price of Kinross common stock would increase the value of our holdings of Kinross by $977,000 and increase other comprehensive income and total stockholders’ equity by the same amount, net of deferred taxes of $364,000. Additionally our working capital would also be increased by $436,000 from a hypothetical increase of  10 percent in the price of Kinross common stock, net of deferred taxes of $162,000. This increase is based upon all of our 850,000 Kinross common shares as of December 31, 2011.   A hypothetical decrease of  10 percent in the price of Kinross common stock would have the opposite effect of the increase discussed above.   (2) Our investment in Ely common stock is subject to equity market risk.   As of December 31, 2011 a hypothetical increase of  10 percent in the price of Ely common stock would increase the value of our holdings of Ely by $59,000 and increase other comprehensive income and total stockholders’ equity by the same amount, net of deferred taxes of $22,000. As we have not classified any of our investment in Ely common stock as a current asset, our working capital would not change from a hypothetical increase of 10  percent in the price of Ely common stock.   (3) Our investment in the Ely warrants derivative instruments at December 31, 2011 is not materially subject to equity market risk for changes in the price of Ely common stock. See “Derivative instruments” above.   (b.)	 Interest Rate Risks     We have no material interest rate risks at December 31, 2011.   (1)      Long-term debt.   Our required payments on our long-term debt Augusta note are fixed as the Augusta debt is non-interest bearing, and we recorded discounted fair value of the payments due to Augusta, discounted at 7.5%, which was our estimated cost of similar credit as of the formation of MH-LLC. Accordingly, any increase or decrease in market interest rates will have no effect on our accretion of interest expense or the cash payments to be made on the Augusta note.   (2)      Short-term debt.   An increase or decrease of 10% in the interest rate charged on our short-term margin loans, that currently have a floating rate of 2.5% per annum, would not have a material impact on our interest expense.   (c.)	 Exchange Rate Risks The portion of our cash that is denominated in foreign currency is subject to exchange rate risk. Solitario’s cash accounts in foreign subsidiaries not denominated in United States dollars represent the only significant foreign currency denominated assets. Foreign currency denominated cash accounts totaled $325,000 and $32,000, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and 2010. We have estimated that as of December 31, 2011 an increase in the value of the Brazilian Real to the United States Dollar of 10% would decrease our cash on hand by $28,000, and increase our net loss in the statement of operations by $28,000, net of deferred taxes of $10,000. A decrease in the value of the Brazilian Real to the United States Dollar of 10% would increase the value of our cash and reduce our net loss in the statement of operations by the opposite amount. We have no other material exchange rate risks as of December 31, 2011, as our other foreign denominated cash accounts are not significant to our total assets, liabilities or operating results. Our other operating assets and liabilities are generally dominated in United States Dollars and do not have material exchange rate risks.       56     Table of Contents        		</c>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION      The following discussions contain forward-looking information.  Readers are cautioned that such information involves risks and uncertainties, including those created by general market conditions, competition and the possibility of events may occur which limit our ability to maintain or improve our operating results or execute our primary growth strategy.  Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and there can therefore be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate. The inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives and plans will be achieved.      The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. CURRENT PLAN OF OPERATIONS      Our current business objective for the next 12 months is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation.  Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.  We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.      We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide us with positive cash flows.  As such, the costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next approximately 12 months and beyond will be paid with our current cash on hand and through funds from financing to be obtained.      During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition.      We believe we will be able to meet these costs with our current cash on hand and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders or other investors.      We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.  In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.      Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings.  In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.      We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky.  Because of general economic conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital, our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation.  Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock.  Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.                                      10 Liquidity and Capital Resources      At December 31, 2011, we had a working capital deficit of $2,600,473 compared to working capital deficit of $1,702,544 at December 31, 2010.  The increase in the working capital deficit is due primarily to the increase in accrued liabilities.  We had shareholders' deficit of $2,600,473 at December 31, 2011.      Net cash used in operating activities was $82 for 2011, compared to $300 for 2010.      We have incurred operating losses from inception through December 31, 2011.  We incurred operating losses of $15,426 in 2011 and $14,185 in 2010.  At December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of $16,561,721.      Management believes that we will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of liquidity to meet our business plan and capital needs through December 31, 2012.  Management believes we have the ability to obtain additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain our operations.      At December 31, 2011, we had cash of $300.  We have limited cash resources available and have obligations due and past due. Critical Accounting Policies      Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivable, investment values, income taxes, the recapitalization and contingencies.  We base our estimates on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 		</c>
