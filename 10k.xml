		<c><![CDATA[of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations General The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company’s business operations are discussed throughout , where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions. Overview PASSUR Aerospace, Inc. is a business intelligence company which develops predictive analytics built on proprietary algorithms and on concurrent integration and simultaneous mining of multiple databases. The Company believes it is positioned to provide the industry standard in business intelligence and predictive analytics for both commercial and government applications. The Company’s revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and solutions information as well as software products; (2) professional services; and (3) annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR® Radar Systems. The Company’s major achievements during fiscal year 2011 are summarized below. The Company: 1. Renewed a major contract with the FAA for a program to provide access to PASSUR®’s aviation security-related products in support of the FAA’s joint role with the TSA. 2. Launched PASSUR® Integrated Traffic Management (PITM) – a suite of integrated decision-support capabilities that target expensive, disruptive constraints in the National Air Space (NAS) through data, predictive analytics, common operating/ collaborative platforms, and detailed performance analysis. PITM allows airlines and airports to increase the efficiency, predictability, safety, and cost effectiveness of their surface operations. 3. Developed and launched the Company’s Surface Management Program, which is an independent, worldwide, gate-to-gate network of flight tracking and airspace information. This solution is used to address congestion on the ground and in the air and to reduce fuel burn and delays. Page 13 4. Announced a teaming agreement with ARINC to develop and deliver predictive analytics and decision support solutions -directly to the flight deck. This solution provides for greater efficiency, communication, and collaboration with the flight crew, while increasing the critical role of Dispatch. 5. Entered into a teaming agreement with Mosaic ATM to bring to market additional products, solutions, and services for departure metering, networked surface management, and integrated traffic management. 6. Collaborated with MIT on a ground-breaking study of surface departure metering at JFK International Airport showing the following significant benefits (annualized from seven months of data studied): $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 in reduced fuel costs, 48,000 fewer metric tons of carbon released into the atmosphere, 14,800 fewer hours of taxi time, and 5,000,000 gallons of fuel saved. 7. Expanded the PASSUR® National Airport Network of Field Condition Reporting by over 40%. The program consolidates field condition reporting for all participating airports onto a single screen, adds new levels of automation, and is available to, and accessed by airline system operation centers in the U.S. and internationally. 8. Launched the National Airport Information Network, addressing the industry’s needs for more effective, coordinated, and collaborative response to diversions and tarmac delays by consolidating PASSUR®’s tarmac delay, diversion management, and field condition capabilities onto a single, national industry platform. 9. Expanded the reach and deployment of the PASSUR® Landing Fee Management program, the industry’s leading platform for the collaborative management of landing fees among airports and airlines, using independent, standardized, and automated processes. 10. Increased the Company’s intellectual property portfolio by being awarded five new patents from November 1, 2010 to January 4, 2012. During that same period, the Company filed for an additional seven patents, all relating to improved business intelligence or predictive analytics. The Company currently owns twelve issued patents, and has an additional twenty patents which are pending with the United States Patent Office. The Company’s business plan is to continue to focus on increasing subscription-based revenues from its suite of software applications, and to develop new applications and professional services designed to address the needs of the aviation industry and the U.S. government. The Company’s strategy is to help solve problems faced by its customers and is built on the following basic objectives: (1) continue extending the reach of the PASSUR® Network, which provides the proprietary backbone for many of its solutions; (2) continue integrating multiple additional industry data sets into its integrated aviation database, including data from a variety of additional aircraft, airspace, and ground surveillance technologies, in order to ensure that PASSUR® is the primary choice for data integration and management for large aviation organizations; (3) continue developing decision support solutions built on business intelligence, predictive analytics, and web-dashboard technology; and (4) continue developing the Company’s professional service capabilities, in order to ensure that its solutions can be fully implemented in the customer’s work environment, with minimal demand on the customer’s internal resources. The Company shipped one and installed ten Company-owned PASSUR® Systems during fiscal year 2011 (installations include systems shipped in the current and previous fiscal year). The shipped and installed PASSUR® Systems are capitalized as part of the Company-owned PASSUR® Network. The Company will continue to expand the PASSUR® Network by shipping and installing additional PASSUR® Systems throughout fiscal year 2012. Management anticipates that future PASSUR® sites will provide increased coverage for the PASSUR® Network by increasing the Company’s ability to contract with new customers at such locations, and by providing existing customers with additional data solutions. The Company will continue to market the business intelligence, predictive analytics, as well as decision support applications and solutions derived from the PASSUR® Network, directly to the aviation industry and organizations that serve, or are served by, the aviation industry. There were one hundred and fifty-five Company-owned PASSUR® Systems located at airports worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2011. Redundant PASSUR® Systems have been installed at major customer locations. Revenues Management concentrates its efforts on the sale of business intelligence, predictive analytics, and decision support product applications, utilizing data primarily derived from the PASSUR® Network. Such efforts include the continued development of new products, professional services, and existing product enhancements. Page 14 Revenues increased by $2,650,000, or 24%, to $13,609,000 in fiscal year 2011 from $10,958,000 in fiscal year 2010. New customer subscriptions and existing customer upgrades to the Company’s suite of software applications and new customer engagements for professional services accounted for 95% and 5% of this increase, respectively. The Company continues to develop and deploy new software applications and solutions, as well as a wide selection of products which address customers’ needs, easily delivered through web-based applications, as well as other new products which include stand-alone professional services. Cost of Revenues Costs associated with subscription and maintenance revenues consist primarily of direct labor, depreciation of PASSUR® Network Systems, amortization of capitalized software development costs, communication costs, data feeds, allocated overhead costs, travel and entertainment, and consulting fees. Also included in cost of revenues are costs associated with upgrades to PASSUR® Network Systems necessary to make such systems compatible with new software applications, as well as the ordinary repair and maintenance of existing PASSUR® Network Systems. Additionally, cost of revenues in each reporting period is impacted by: (1) the number of PASSUR® Network units added to the Network, which include the production, shipment, and installation of these assets, which are capitalized to the PASSUR® Network; and (2) capitalized costs associated with software development projects. Both of these are referred to as “Capitalized Assets”, and are depreciated and/or amortized over their respective useful lives and charged to cost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased by $1,091,000, or 23%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 primarily due to increases in payroll and related costs of $561,000, depreciation and amortization of $285,000, as well as an increase in communication costs. When the Company ships and installs its PASSUR® Network Systems, there is a reduction in cost of revenues due to the fact that the labor related costs for these systems are capitalized, rather than expensed, as a component of costs of revenue. Fewer systems were shipped and installed in fiscal year 2011, as compared to fiscal year 2010, which resulted in an $814,000 increase in cost of revenues as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase in cost of revenues was partially offset by an increase of $747,000 in the capitalization of software development costs as compared to fiscal year 2010, due primarily to the Company’s increased investment in software development projects in the current fiscal year. Research and Development Research and development expenses increased by $113,000, or 39%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily due to the Company’s investment in research and development in a substantial software product. These increases consisted primarily of payroll and related costs. The Company’s research and development efforts include activities associated with new product development, as well as the enhancement and improvement of the Company's existing hardware, software, and information products. The Company anticipates that it will continue to invest in research and development to develop, maintain, and support existing and newly developed applications for its customers. There were no customer-sponsored research and development activities during fiscal years 2011 or 2010. Research and development expenses are funded by current operations. Selling, General, and Administrative Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by $914,000, or 21%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010, primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs. Income from Operations Revenues increased by $2,650,000, or 24%, to $13,609,000, total costs and expenses increased by $2,119,000, or 22%, to $11,635,000, and income from operations increased by $531,000, or 37%, to $1,974,000 in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010. Page 15 Interest Expense – Related Party Interest expense – related party decreased by $463,000, or 34%, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to fiscal year 2010 due to the fact that on May 9, 2011, the Company entered into a transaction that reduced its outstanding notes payable to G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company’s significant shareholder and Chairman, by $10,000,000, as a result of the transaction described in “Private Placement” below. On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued, as a result of the transaction described in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below. Income Taxes The Company’s provision for income taxes in each year consists of current state and local minimum taxes. At October 31, 2011, the Company had available a federal net operating loss carry-forward of $12,014,000 for income tax purposes, which will expire in various tax years from 2012 through 2029. The Company evaluates whether a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required each reporting period. A valuation allowance is established if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized. During 2011 the Company reversed $1,590,000 of a total valuation allowance of $3,896,000 related to deferred tax assets, since it was determined that it is more likely than not these assets will be realized. This determination was primarily based on cumulative positive earnings in recent years and projected taxable income in the future. In evaluating whether or not to realize a deferred tax asset, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results and a forecast of future taxable income. Net Income The Company had net income of $2,634,000, or $.39 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2011 as compared to net income of $21,000, or $.00 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2010. Impact of Inflation In the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the Company including selling prices, capital expenditures, and operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s current liabilities exceeded current assets by $417,000 at October 31, 2011. The note payable to a related party was $4,815,000 at October 31, 2011, with a maturity of November 1, 2014. The Company’s stockholders’ equity was $7,165,000 at October 31, 2011. The Company had net income of $2,634,000 for fiscal year 2011. Management is addressing the Company’s working capital deficiency by aggressively marketing the Company’s PASSUR® Network Systems information capabilities in its existing product and professional service lines, as well as in new products and professional services, which are continually being developed and deployed. Management believes that expanding its existing suite of software products and professional services, which address the wide array of needs of the aviation industry, through the continued development of new product and service offerings, will continue to lead to increased growth in the Company’s customer-base and subscription-based revenues. Additionally, if the Company’s business plan does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the Company’s operating cash requirements, the Company will attempt to obtain external financing, and if such external financing is not obtained, the Company has received an unconditional and irrevocable commitment from its significant shareholder and Chairman to receive the necessary continuing financial support to meet such obligations through January 4, 2013. Page 16 Effective November 1, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement, renewing and extending the term of the $13,815,000 notes payable due to G.S. Beckwith Gilbert, the Company’s significant shareholder and Chairman, from one year to three years with a maturity of November 1, 2011. Under the agreement, beginning February 1, 2009 and effective through October 31, 2011, the interest rate was increased from 4.5% to 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6%, was payable in cash, and the remaining interest, at the annual rate of 3%, was payable at the option of the Company in cash or “paid in kind” and added to the principal of the notes payable. Annual interest payments were due at October 31 of each fiscal year. During October 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the due date of the interest payment owed to Mr. Gilbert on October 31, 2009 to December 31, 2009. This interest payment was paid in full by the Company prior to the extended due date. During fiscal year 2009, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $100,000, bringing the principal amount of the notes payable due to Mr. Gilbert to $13,915,000 on October 31, 2009. In fiscal year 2010, Mr. Gilbert loaned the Company an additional $1,150,000, which was used in part to fund the prior fiscal year’s interest payment, thereby increasing the principal balance of the notes payable to $15,065,000. During fiscal year 2010, the Company paid fiscal year 2010 interest to Mr. Gilbert of $914,000, representing the entire cash portion of the fiscal year 2010 interest due, thereby meeting the cash payment requirements of the loan agreement. Total cash payments for interest made to Mr. Gilbert in fiscal year 2010 were $2,037,000, including the remaining fiscal year 2009 interest payment. The balance of the fiscal year 2010 interest payable of $446,000 was accrued. In October 2010, the Company made a $250,000 principal payment, reducing the loan principal to $14,815,000, resulting in a total of $15,261,000 due to Mr. Gilbert on October 31, 2010. On May 9, 2011, as a result of the transactions described in “Private Placement” below, the Company’s outstanding notes payable to Mr. Gilbert were reduced by $10,000,000, and a new note payable was issued to Mr. Gilbert in the amount of $4,815,000. The new note payable bears a maturity date of November 1, 2014 and an annual interest rate of 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6% will be payable in cash, and the remaining interest of 3% per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or "paid in kind" and added to the principal of the note payable. Interest payments are to be made annually on October 31 of each year. On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued. During fiscal year 2011, the Company paid fiscal year 2011 interest to Mr. Gilbert of $912,000, representing the entire fiscal year 2011 interest due, thereby meeting the payment requirements of the loan agreement. Total payments for interest made to Mr. Gilbert in fiscal year 2011 were $1,358,000, including the remaining fiscal year 2010 interest payment. The Company has received a commitment from Mr. Gilbert, dated January 4, 2012, that if the Company, at any time, is unable to meet its obligations through January 4, 2013, Mr. Gilbert will provide the necessary continuing financial support to the Company in order for the Company to meet such obligations. Such commitment for financial support may be in the form of additional advances or loans to the Company, in addition to the deferral of principal and/or interest payments due on the existing loans, if deemed necessary. The note payable is secured by the Company’s assets. The Company believes that its liquidity is adequate to meet operating and investment requirements through October 31, 2012. During such period the Company does not anticipate borrowing additional funds from Mr. Gilbert, although it has received a commitment from Mr. Gilbert to do so if the Company requires additional funds. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2,982,000 for fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $894,000 non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization of $2,155,000 and stock-based compensation expense, offset by a deferred tax allowance reversal of $1,590,000, as well as $2,634,000 of net income and a decrease in accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of customer invoicing. This increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a decrease of $446,000 of accrued interest – related party, as well as decreases in deferred revenue, and accounts payable, primarily due to the timing of vendor invoice payments. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,657,000 for fiscal year 2011, expended primarily for capitalized software development costs. Net cash used in financing activities was $133,000 for fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $4,250,000 repayments of notes payable – related party and $170,000 private placement expenditures, offset by $4,250,000 proceeds from stock issuance and $37,000 proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Page 17 The Company’s revenue has increased as a result of its subscription-based revenue model. The Company is actively addressing the increasing costs associated with supporting the business, and plans to identify and reduce any unnecessary costs as part of its cost reduction initiatives. Additionally, the aviation market has been impacted by budgetary constraints, airline bankruptcies and consolidations due to the downturn in the current economy, the terrorist events of September 11, 2001, the continued war on terrorism, and changes in fuel costs. The aviation market is extensively regulated by government agencies, particularly the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board, and management anticipates that new regulations relating to air travel may continue to be issued. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues are derived from airports, airlines, and organizations that serve, or are served by, the aviation industry. Any new regulations or changes in the economic situation of the aviation industry could have an impact on the future operations of the Company, either positively or negatively. Interest by potential customers in the information and decision support software products obtained from PASSUR® Network Systems and its professional services remains strong. As a result, the Company anticipates an increase in future revenues. However, the Company cannot predict if such revenues will materialize. If sales do not increase, losses may occur. The extent of such profits or losses will be dependent on sales volume achieved and Company cost reduction initiatives. Private Placement On May 9, 2011, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements to sell 1,044,644 shares of the Company’s common stock, subject to trading restrictions, in a private placement financing with a select group of accredited investors, including certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company - 687,500 shares of restricted common stock were sold to non-affiliated investors at a price of $4.00 per share and 357,144 shares of restricted common stock were sold to three of the Company’s Directors at a price of $4.20 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of $4,250,000. In addition, on the same day, the Company entered into a debt conversion agreement with Mr. Gilbert, pursuant to which the Company (1) repaid, from the private placement proceeds, $4,250,000 of principal on the outstanding notes payable to Mr. Gilbert and (2) converted $5,750,000 of the principal amount of the notes payable held by Mr. Gilbert into 1,369,048 shares of common stock, subject to trading restrictions. A new note payable was issued to Mr. Gilbert equal to the remaining $4,815,000 principal balance of the existing notes payable following such conversion. The stock issued by the Company to Mr. Gilbert was done so based on the trading price of the Company’s stock and thus considered to be fair value based on a Level 1 input per ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, and accordingly no gain or loss resulted from the conversion. The new note payable bears a maturity date of November 1, 2014 and an annual interest rate of 9%, payable as follows: interest at the annual rate of 6% will be payable in cash, and the remaining interest of 3% per annum will be payable at the option of the Company in cash or "paid in kind" and added to the principal of the note payable. Interest payments will be made annually on October 31 of each year. On September 6, 2011, the Company entered into an amendment to the note payable agreement, reducing the annual interest rate from 9% to an annual rate of 6%, payable in cash, and the Company’s option to pay the remaining interest of 3% per annum in cash or “paid in kind” was discontinued. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates General The Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities based upon accounting policies management has implemented. The Company has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company’s business operations are discussed throughout , where such policies affect its reported financial results. The actual impact of these factors may differ under different assumptions or conditions. The Company’s accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment and estimates include: Page 18 Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 104.”) SAB 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company also recognizes revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 985-605 (SOP 97-2, “Software Revenue Recognition”) as amended, when applicable. The Company’s revenues are generated by selling: (1) subscription-based real-time decision and solutions information as well as software products; (2) professional services; and (3) annual maintenance contracts for PASSUR® Radar Systems. Revenues generated from subscription and maintenance agreements are recognized over the term of such executed agreements and/or customer’s receipt of such data or services. In accordance with ASC 985-605, we recognize revenue from the licensing of our software products or performance of maintenance when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have evidence of an agreement with a customer; (2) we deliver the products/services; (3) license or maintenance agreement terms are deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or uncertainties that may alter the agreement, such that the sale may not be complete and/or final; and (4) collection is probable. The Company records revenues pursuant to individual contracts on a month-by-month basis, as outlined by the applicable agreement. In many cases, the Company may invoice respective customers in advance of the specified period, either quarterly or annually, which coincides with the terms of the agreement. In such cases, the Company will defer at the close of each month and/or reporting period, any subscription or maintenance revenues invoiced for which services have yet to be rendered, in accordance with ASC 985-605. Our software licenses usually do not include acceptance provisions. An acceptance provision generally allows a customer to test the software for a defined period of time before committing to a binding agreement to license the software. If a subscription agreement includes an acceptance provision, the Company will not recognize revenue until the earlier of the receipt of a written customer acceptance or, if not notified by the customer to cancel the subscription agreement, the expiration of the acceptance period. From time to time, the Company will receive one-time payments from customers for rights, including but not limited to, the rights to use certain data at an agreed upon location(s) for a specific use and/or for an unlimited number of users. Such one-time payments are in the form of license fees. These fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the license agreement or expected useful life of such license arrangement, whichever is longer, but typically five years. Deferred revenue is classified on the Company’s balance sheet as a liability until such time as revenue from services is properly recognized as revenue in accordance with SAB 104 and/or ASC 985-605 and the corresponding agreement. Capitalized Software Development Costs The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 985-20 (SFAS 86, “ Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed ”). Capitalized software development costs are comprised of costs incurred to develop and significantly enhance software products to be sold or otherwise marketed. When technological feasibility is established, the Company begins to capitalize development costs, and once the software product is available for general release to the public, the Company begins to amortize such costs to cost of revenues. The Company’s policy on capitalized software costs determines whether the costs incurred are classified as capitalized costs (in accordance with ASC 985-20) or as research and development expenses. In cases where the Company capitalizes costs incurred with development of new hardware/software products, a product specification is developed as the guideline for the capitalization of costs associated with such project in accordance with ASC 985-20. Once a product has been made available for sale and/or released for sale to the general public, the development costs of that product are no longer capitalized and amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis based on the greater of the ratio of current gross revenues to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product beginning at the point the product becomes available for general release, typically over five years. Costs incurred to maintain or support such product are expensed as incurred. In some cases, the Company may capitalize costs incurred in the development of enhanced versions of already existing products, but will immediately expense any additional costs incurred to maintain products which were completed and released to the general public, in accordance with ASC 985-20. Determining and evaluating whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization requires the exercise of judgment by management. Page 19 The Company’s net capitalized software costs totaled $4,642,000 at October 31, 2011. The carrying value of capitalized software costs are evaluated for impairment, based on the forecasted and actual future cash flows expected to be generated from such assets, as determined and evaluated by management. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 360-10 (SFAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”) The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized to the extent the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company evaluates the periods of amortization continually in determining whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. If estimates are changed, the unamortized costs will be allocated to the increased or decreased number of remaining periods in the revised life. The Company’s long-lived assets, which include the PASSUR® Network and property, plant and equipment, totaled $6,654,000, and accounted for 49% of the Company’s total assets as of October 31, 2011. At each reporting period, management evaluates the carrying values of the Company’s assets. The evaluation considers the undiscounted cash flows generated from current contractual revenue sources and the anticipated forecast revenue derived from each asset. The Company then evaluates these revenues on an overall basis to determine if any impairment issues exist. As of October 31, 2011, based upon management’s evaluation of the above asset groups, no impairment of these asset groups exist. If these forecasts are not met, the Company may have to record impairment charges not previously recorded. Depreciation and Amortization The net PASSUR® Network, net capitalized software development costs, and net property, plant and equipment totaled $6,282,000, $4,642,000, and $371,000, respectively, at October 31, 2011. Total depreciation and amortization expense related to these capitalized assets was $2,155,000 in fiscal year 2011. In management’s judgment, the estimated depreciable lives used to calculate the annual depreciation and amortization expense are appropriate. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows: PASSUR® Network 7 years Capitalized software development costs 5 years Property, plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The PASSUR® Network includes PASSUR® Systems and the related software workstations used for the data derived from PASSUR® Systems, as well as costs pertaining to raw material, work-in-process, and finished goods components. PASSUR® Network installations include the direct and indirect production and installation costs incurred for each of the Company-owned PASSUR® Systems. PASSUR® Network Systems which are not installed in the PASSUR® Network are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded. Once installed, the PASSUR® Systems are depreciated over seven years. All of the Company’s capitalized assets are recorded at cost (which may also include salaries and related overhead costs incurred during production and/or development) and depreciated and/or amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life for financial statement purposes. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors, including historical experience with similar assets, technological life cycles, and industry standards for similar assets. Circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments (see “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” above) are identified and prospective depreciation or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly. Page 20 Total depreciation and amortization expense was $2,155,000 in fiscal year 2011, and consisted of $1,364,000, $716,000, and $75,000 for the PASSUR® Network, capitalized software development costs, and property, plant and equipment, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 718 (SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payments” ) which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant, and recognition of stock-based compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest. The fair value of stock options was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period, net of forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense was $259,000 and $120,000 in fiscal years 2011 and 2010, respectively, and was primarily included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. Specifically, the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive income, or in two separate, but consecutive statements. The new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. While the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income, there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance. We do not expect that the adoption of this disclosure-only guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial results and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. In May 2011, the FASB issued amendments to fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. This guidance amends United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) to conform with measurement and disclosure requirements in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The amendments change the wording used to describe the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. This includes clarification of the Board’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. In addition, to improve consistency in application across jurisdictions, some changes in wording are necessary to ensure that U.S. GAAP and IFRS fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way (for example, using the word “shall” rather than “should” to describe the requirements in U.S. GAAP). This amended guidance is to be applied prospectively and becomes effective during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We do not expect this guidance will have a material impact on results of operations or financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk: Not Required ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with ESW's Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, the anticipated financial and operating results of ESW's business. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. ESW undertakes no obligation to publicly release any modifications or revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, ESW caution investors that actual financial and operating results may differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, ESW. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties inherent in forward-looking statements (are set forth in the Risk Factor disclosure contained elsewhere in this report). OVERVIEW Environmental Solutions Worldwide Inc. ("we," "us," "ESW" or the "Company") is a publicly traded company engaged through its wholly-owned subsidiaries ESW Canada Inc. (“ESWC”), ESW America Inc. (“ESWA”), Technology Fabricators Inc. (“TFI”) and ESW Technologies Inc. (“ESWT”), (together the "ESW Group of Companies") in the design, development, manufacture and sale of emission technologies and services. ESW is currently focused on the international medium duty and heavy duty diesel engine market for on-road and off-road vehicles as well as the utility engine, mining, marine, locomotive and military industries. ESW also offers engine and after treatment emissions verification testing and certification services. ESW's focus is to be an integrated solutions provider to the environmental emissions market by providing leading-edge catalyst technology as well as best-in-class engine and vehicle emissions testing and certification services. The Company's strategy is centered on identifying and deploying resources against its "sweet-spot" products, where ESW has identified its core competencies and differentiation in the marketplace. ESW's core geography focus is North America, and will opportunistically explore business development opportunities in other markets if accretive to the Company in the short term. By focusing financial, human and intellectual capital on ESW's core competencies and markets, the Company is targeting profitable growth in the short term and value creation for its shareholders over the long term. 19 Factors that are critical to ESW's success include winning new business, obtaining additional regulatory verifications for emission control products, managing and optimizing ESW's manufacturing capabilities to correspond with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in its manufacturing processes, and reducing overall costs. In addition, ESW's ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as increasing technologically sophisticated products, changing aftermarket distribution partners, and increasing environmental standards, also plays a critical role in its success. Other factors that are critical to ESW's success include adjusting to environmental and economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and ESW's ability to offset such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives and other methods. ESW has made significant efforts and investment to comply with new regulations which came into force in January of 2009. (See ITEM 1. BUSINESS - PRODUCT CERTIFICATION). ESW's ThermaCat Active Level III Plus catalyst system has been verified by CARB for a variety of on- and off-road engine applications (PM reduction greater than 85%). The ThermaCat filter system is a combined technology comprised of a chemically coated wire mesh substrate and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) combined with an electronically controlled external fuel injection component. The ThermaCat regeneration process is an electronically controlled exothermic reaction and occurs automatically during normal vehicle operation, transparent to the operator. The EPA's Voluntary Diesel Retrofit Program signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the State of California Air Resources Board for the coordination and reciprocity in diesel retrofit device verification. The EPA recognizes and accepts those retrofit hardware strategies or device-based systems that have been verified by CARB. This reciprocity agreement allows ESW's Therma Cat (TM) technology to be used in the remaining 49 states and it allows ESW to participate in EPA funded programs worldwide. In 2011, ESW focused on optimizing the Company's operations around its "sweet spots" and capturing a greater market share in the catalytic converter and emissions testing markets whilst ensuring steps towards profitable growth as compared to 2010. The key factors that are in ESW's favor are: (a) continued regulatory push for emissions reductions in the United States, (b) funding available from public agencies, (c) a market-leading Level III active catalytic converter technology and an established distribution network in North America, and (d) CARB and EPA certification and verification capable emissions and durability testing services. ESW believes that it can improve and achieve profitability and grow its business by pursuing the following strategy: • Focus on delivering controlled and profitable growth to its shareholders. • Provide integrated solutions to the emissions market by leveraging its product development, testing and certification services, and distribution and post-sale services capabilities. • Center the Company's sales strategy around identified "sweet-spots" that will allow manufacturing efficiency gains and optimized resource allocation. • Educate the end customers about the technology and ensure realistic delivery timeline expectations. • Enhance scheduling and customer service functions and importance. • Work with vendors to optimize ESW's material buys and lead times. • Constantly review operations, processes and products under a Continuous Improvement / Performance Based culture. To deliver against this strategic intent, in February and May 2011, ESW secured a total of $4 million in financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to affiliate shareholders (the "Bridge Lenders"). Proceeds of the notes, along with available cash, were used to fund working capital, capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The notes allowed the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with covenant obligations under the credit agreement with its senior lender dated March 10, 2010 for which the Company and subsidiaries had previously obtained waivers of covenant obligations that expired February 15, 2011. 20 Effective May 10, 2011, the Company announced that it had entered into an Investment Agreement with the Bridge Lenders, who are current shareholders and at the time were also subordinated lenders to ESW under unsecured promissory notes totaling $4.0 million. The Bridge Lenders agreed to provide a backstop commitment to a rights offering of the Company's common stock at a sale price of $0.12 per share (Qualified Offering) and agreed to collectively backstop the Qualified Offering by purchasing from the Company at a subscription price of $0.12 per share of Common Stock. The backstop provided for the participants of the Investment Agreement to buy any shares not purchased by the Company's shareholders of record that were entitled to participate in the rights offering (after giving effect to any oversubscriptions) up to 29,166,667 shares of Common Stock for a total purchase price of $3.5 million. On May 10, 2011 the Company filed a Registration Statement related to subscription rights to purchase Common Stock, $0.001 par value and the shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the exercise of the subscription rights pursuant to the rights offering. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2011. The Company offered rights to existing shareholders of record as of June 9, 2011 to purchase approximately $8 million in shares of common stock. The rights offering sought to raise cash for the Company to meet its working capital needs and pay down ESW’s senior lender. The rights offering allowed for all subordinated lenders to exchange their unsecured subordinated promissory notes (and other notes paid in-kind for the payment of interest under the notes) for shares of common stock under the offering. On June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering. A total of 66,670,012 shares were issued as part of the rights offering and related transactions, $3.9 million was raised in cash and $4.1 million was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes. Under the Rights Offering, shareholders subscribed for 15,590,234 shares for approximately $1.9 million in cash. The Bridge Lenders subscribed for 23,228,970 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.12 per share, which was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes of approximately $2.8 million. Pursuant to the backstop commitment, the Bridge Lenders purchased 27,714,385 shares of Common Stock at price of $0.12 per share for approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.0 million was paid in cash and $1.3 million was paid for through the exchange of the balance of principal and accrued interest due on the Notes. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. Effective July 18, 2011, ESWC paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, encumbrances and securities against ESW and its subsidiaries and cancelled the March 31, 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement. The additional capital raised by the rights offering is expected to give ESW the opportunity to execute against its short term and medium term plans. ESW has made significant investments in research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals for its technologies. On August 23, 2011, ESW received notification from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") that the Company's XtrmCat Kit is now certified for 2 stroke, Category 2, marine engines. The issuance of the 'remanufacturing certificate' is a significant milestone for the Company as it validates the DOC technology for the marine market sector. The Certifications are applicable to Electro-Motive Diesel (“EMD”) 710 and 645 engines. The XtrmCat can achieve Tier 0 and Tier I compliance as per 40 CFR 1042 when retrofitted to EMD 710 and 645 engines. ESW is pursuing opportunities to commercialize this technology into the marketplace. The products that ESW is pursuing for verification / certification to cover the following primary technology levels established by CARB: • Expansion of On Road Active Diesel Particulate Filter verification to include Exhaust Gas Recirculation engines for Level III +- PM reduction greater than 85%. • ESW's XtrmCat product designed for locomotive, Tier 0, turbocharged EMD 645 and 710 engines was tested at an EPA recognized facility for certification during March and April 2011 along with the marine product. Certification applications for the rail product are pending with the EPA. 21 ESW believes that with the additional certifications/verification of the above range of products, ESW will cover a significant portion of the market and give ESW the competitive advantage to be the technology of first choice in retrofit and OEM applications. ESW is not contemplating pursuing verification for a Level II and/or Level I product in North America and will opportunistically explore deployment of these products in overseas markets. The cost of developing a complete range of products to meet regulations is substantial. ESW believes that it possesses a competitive advantage in ensuring regulatory compliance by leveraging its Testing and Research facility in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania to support its certification and verification efforts. ESW has also managed to offset some of these development costs through the application of research grants and tax refunds. ESW has made the following adjustments to its business in 2011: 1) ESW has reviewed and continues to review its costs for inefficiencies and has taken steps to reduce its operating expenses. Key cost reduction initiatives during the first half 2011 included the restructuring of its management team, the termination of certain contracts and the re-negotiation of board and consulting obligations, amongst others. In addition, during the second semester of the year, ESW reduced its overhead costs by re-locating its Canadian manufacturing operations to its facilities located in the State of Pennsylvania in the United States. ESW believes that the synergies from operating at a single location will provide significant financial and logistical advantages, as well as synergies with its testing operations. In addition, the move to the United States will help mitigate currency risk as currently all of ESW’s revenues are from the United States and a significant portion of ESW’s raw materials and components are being sourced from the United States. Key components of our transition plan have been completed. For the Canadian facility at Concord, Ontario ESW has retained a commercial real estate broker and the facility is being marketed for a sub-lease or re-lease ESW expects to transition out of the Canadian facility by June 30, 2012. ESW is also offsetting a portion of the relocation and training costs through state grants provided by the State of Pennsylvania. In addition, ESW has also applied to the State of Pennsylvania for up to $500,000 capital financing under its economic development programs, initial approval for the loan has been received and ESW is in the process of process of finalizing principal, security and terms.ESW has transitioned the production from Concord, Ontario, Canada to its existing facility located in Montgomeryville, PA. During the last quarter of 2011 all products were produced and shipped from Montgomeryville, PA. ESW has made changes to its Canadian operations and the phased reduction in headcount has been completed. ESW will continuously revisit opportunities to further streamline the business. 2) Since January 2010 there has been a significant increase in the cost of material and components that ESW uses. ESW has revised the pricing to its dealers to help recover product margins. The first phase of the price increases was implemented on June 30, 2011. ESW has also revised its overall commercial policies, including its general terms and conditions and lead time expectations on its products. Changes have also been implemented to ESW's costing and quoting processes, including frequent periodic review of its bill of materials and the proactive negotiation of raw material prices. 3) ESW is focusing on increasing sales volumes on its core "sweet spot" products to reduce production complexities and improve inventory management. ESW is has also implemented new continuous improvement programs such as the cross-functional "Product and Process Review" stream led by ESW's engineering team searching for product, product quality and product development process enhancements. 4) ESW has revisited relationships with critical vendors, in addition to setting up favorable payment plans to reduce the outstanding balances with these vendors. ESW has also secured and continues to secure volume discounts on critical components. ESW has also identified and engaged new vendors in the U.S. for parts supply. In addition, there is a greater focus on outsourcing opportunity for labor intensive parts. 5) ESW has revised and implemented its new warranty policy to ensure that warranty terms and conditions meet industry standards whilst mitigating warranty risks to the fullest extent possible. ESW has also launched a backend website to assist its distributors and installers in day to day operations, training and processes. 22 6) ESW is in the process of continuously engaging its existing dealers to help better understand ESW's business and product positioning and to strengthen ESW's partnership with its distribution base. ESW is also opportunistically adding new independent emissions focused dealers to enhance the Company’s North American sales coverage. 7) ESW is focusing on increasing revenue from testing services provided to third parties from its Air Testing Facility in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. In 2011, ESW’s Air Testing Services in Montgomeryville, PA has seen a sizeable increase in business, in line with ESW’s effort to increase revenues from these operations. Revenue from offering air testing as a service to outside customers has increased from $ 153,379 for the year ended 2010 to $581,591 for the year ended 2011. As a result from these actions, the Company is positioned to improve its operational results in 2012. The Company has reduced inefficiencies in personnel-related costs, manufacturing costs and other discretionary expenditures that are within the Company's control. The Company is also seeking to lower its overhead costs while maintaining its focus on the Sales, Marketing and Customer Service efforts. The changes in the business are anticipated to lower the overall operating costs in the Company and improve the Company's overall results, without affecting the Company's positioning of its existing products and testing services as well as its efforts to develop and deliver to market the next generation of leading emissions products and services. COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $1,448,520, or 13.9 percent, to $11,885,665 from $10,437,145 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in revenue is mainly related to a 17% increase sales of ESW's verified ThermaCat Level III products, further complemented by an increase in revenues of ESW America’s air testing operations, revenue from air testing as a service to outside customers has increased from $ 153,379 for the year ended 2010 to $581,591 for the year ended 2011. These revenue increases were offset by decreases in sales of the CleanCat product that was not sold in 2011 and a decrease in revenues for the XtrmCat marine product, which received certification in August 2011. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 81.7 percent compared to 69.6 percent for the year ended December 31, 2010. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $2,451,354 or 33.76 percent. The primary reason for the lower gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2011 was: (a) the write-down of inventory in the amount of $638,048, of this amount $223,007 has been setup as a reserve at December 31, 2011 and relates to the higher overhead costs of the Canadian operations, (b) increases in the cost of materials of $964,913 mainly driven by the increasing cost of precious metals, components and supplies used in production (c) an increase in overhead costs of $717,709 as we apply higher overheads to our cost of sales that was previously expensed as operating expenses, and (d) an increase of $130,684 in labour cost that was also previously expensed as operating expenses. The Company is constantly reviewing its production costing and has updated the pricing of its products to distributors. In addition, ESW has also streamlined its manufacturing operations by relocating the manufacturing operations to Montgomeryville, PA, where it is co-located with the air testing operations, which reduces manufacturing overhead expense. Marketing, office and general expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011, decreased by $827,548, or 17.5 percent, to $3,891,814 from $4,719,362 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is primarily due to: (a) a decrease in Sales and Marketing wages and selling expenses by $194,613, resulting from a decrease in Sales and Marketing wages and a reversal of bad debt provisions on December 31, 2010, (b) a decrease of $88,961 in facility costs as we apply higher facility overheads to cost of sales, (c) a decrease in factory expenses of $259,125 resulting from higher overheads applied to cost of sales, (d) a decrease in administration salaries and wages of $49,375 resulting from restructuring activities, (e) a decrease in investor relation costs of $98,663 resulting from cancellation of an investor relation contract, and (f) a decrease in general administration costs of $136,811 resulting from restructuring activities. During the fourth quarter of 2011, all manufacturing operations were conducted out of the Montgomeryville, PA facility and the rent for the Canadian facility for this period has been expensed as Marketing, office and general expenses under facility costs. ESW has retained a commercial real estate broker and the facility is being marketed for a sub-lease or re-lease ESW expects to transition completely out of the Canadian facility by June 30, 2012. 23 The Company incurred $1,385,685 in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 (December 31, 2010 - $0), due to severance and other related payments. The Company incurred severance expenses related to separation agreements with its former Chief Executive Officer, Vice President of Operations and Director of Sales in the amount of $450,309, and separation agreements for the second round of restructuring as a result of relocation of operations in the amount of $297,846. The total of all severance agreements with employees amounted to $748,155. The details of the restructuring charges are as follows: Details $ Severance agreements $ 748,155 Software impairment 133,542 Product line changes 125,113 Training and set up expenses 172,748 Travel costs 62,933 Moving expenses 40,025 Legal fees 26,467 Relocation costs 22,437 Others 54,265 $1,385,685 Research and development ("R&D") expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $90,967, or 11.6 percent, to $692,977 from $783,944 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The primary driver of R&D expenses for the fiscal year 2011 related to ESW's pursuit of the certification of its locomotive and marine product, the XtrmCat, including the final EPA certification testing at a recognized testing facility. To offset this increase, the Company received grant money amounting to $278,712 and $143,375 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Officers’ compensation and directors’ fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $253,914, or 26.6 percent, to $700,140 from $954,054 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is mainly due to changes in executive management and the Company’s board compensation structure. Consulting and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $114,822, or 25.4 percent, to $336,523 from $451,345 for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the prior year period expenses were higher and related to (a) legal fees for ESW’s March 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement with a Canadian chartered bank, (b) higher audit fees, (c) fees related to Sarbanes-Oxley 404 consulting, and (d) fees related to a management consultant. Foreign exchange loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $248,306 as compared to a loss of $103,256 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Due to the change in accounting policy, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, ESW recognized a translation loss of $186,812, which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2011. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by 56.3 percent from $837,448 to $366,266 year-on-year. In the year ended December 31, 2011 the depreciation costs were substantially lower as (a) we did not depreciate assets held for sale and scrapped as a result of the relocation of operations from Canada, (b) we applied additional depreciation to cost of sales, (c) patents were fully amortized, and (d) a portion of the assets have been fully depreciated. The Company has recorded an impairment loss of $163,668 for property, plant and equipment of ESW Canada for the year ended December 31, 2011. ESW recovered $131,570 from sales of assets with no further recovery estimated from the sale of plant and machinery and office equipment, with the remaining plant and machinery and office equipment remaining in Canada being fully written down. The balance of the plant and machinery and office equipment has been transferred to Montgomeryville, PA. The leasehold improvements have been fully written down as the operations have been relocated from the Concord, Ontario, facility. Loss on impairment of property plant and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0. 24 Loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011, increased by $938,804 or 20.1 percent, to $5,612,564 from $4,673,760 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Of the $5,612,564 in loss from operations, $2,097,383 was attributed to non cash losses for the year ended December 31, 2011, including depreciation and amortization of $735,030, loss on impairment of property plant and equipment of $295,238, write-down of inventory in the amount of $638,048, stock based compensation of $180,761 and a foreign exchange loss of $248,306. In addition, the Company has also incurred $1,385,685 of expenses related to the restructuring of its operations. Interest expense on long-term debt related to Convertible Debentures was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $183,858 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Amortization of deferred costs amounted to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $117,131 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Long term debt accretion expenses amounted to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $768,981 for the year ended December 31, 2010. Effective March 25, 2010, the November 2008 and the August 2009 debenture holders agreed to convert all outstanding convertible debentures as per the terms of the respective debenture agreements. The early conversion of the debentures was a condition precedent to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESW Canada, entering into a new credit facility with CIBC. The conversion of the November 2008 and the August 2009 debentures also triggered the mandatory conversion feature on the March 19, 2010, debentures. As part of the agreement to convert all existing convertible debentures the Company has paid a premium as an inducement to convert all debentures. The premium was payable to all converting debenture holders and was subject to a positive fairness opinion by a Fairness Committee consisting of independent directors of the Company's Board of Directors and an increase in the share capital of the Company. The premium consists of 4,375,665 shares of Common Stock. As the Company did not have sufficient authorized shares as of the date of conversion of the debentures to fulfill the premium, the premium had been recorded as an advance share purchase agreement at fair market value $2,909,872 at September 30, 2010. The agreement was without interest, subordinated to the banks position and payable in a fixed number of common shares (4,375,665 shares) of the Company upon increase in the authorized share capital of the Company. In summary, the fair value of the advanced share subscription was dependent on the market price of the Company's common stock, as the Company did not have sufficient available authorized common shares to fulfill this obligation as on September 30, 2010. The advanced share subscription was re-valued based on the market price of the Company's common stock at the end of each reporting period until it was fulfilled by the issuance of authorized common shares in November 2010. The resulting revaluations either cause gains or losses on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Share Subscription Agreement for the 2010 Debentures contained an exchange feature. The exchange feature provided that if within twelve months from March 19, 2010, the Company entered into or closed another financing or other transaction (which for securities law purposes would be integrable with the offer and sale of the Securities) on terms and conditions more favorable to another purchaser, the terms and conditions of the 2010 Debentures shall be adjusted to reflect the more favorable terms. On March 31, 2011, the Company re-evaluated the fair value of the exchange feature and determined that the probability of closing another financing was 100% and the conversion price of the 2010 Debentures would be reset. On March 31, 2011, an additional liability of $578,739 was recorded for the exchange feature in these consolidated financial statements with a $578,739 expense related to change in fair value of exchange feature liability recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Change in fair value of exchange feature liability for the year ended December 31, 2011, amounted to $578,739 as compared to $2,021,213 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company incurred $126,850 interest cost on notes payable to related party for the $4 million unsecured subordinated promissory notes during for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $11,342 for the $500,000 unsecured subordinated promissory notes during the year ended December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company recorded interest accretion expense of $3,506,074 (2010 - $0), a financing charge on embedded derivative liability of $485,101 (2010 - $0) and a gain on convertible derivative of $1,336,445 (2010 - $0) related to the discount feature and the embedded derivative features in the $4 million notes payable to related party. Bank fees resulting from credit facility covenant waivers related to ESW’s secured demand credit agreement amounted to $154,205 for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010 - $0). 25 Restructuring of manufacturing operations : In August 2011, ESW adopted a reorganization plan to reduce its overhead costs by re-locating its Canadian manufacturing operations into its facilities located in the United States. ESW believes that the synergies from operating at a single location will provide significant financial and logistical advantages, as well as synergies with its testing operations also located in the same facility. ESW has transitioned the production from Concord, Ontario, Canada to its existing facility located in Montgomeryville, PA, United States, during the fourth quarter of 2011 all products were manufactured and shipped from the United States. ESW recognized a loss on impairment of property plant and equipment of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and restructuring charges amounted to $1,385,685. In addition, ESW expects to incur additional restructuring charges associated with the closure of the facility, transfer of manufacturing equipment excluding any severance charges during the first half of fiscal 2012. In accordance with ASC 420-10-25-11 costs to terminate an operating lease" arise when a lessee will either: (a) terminate an operating lease; or (b) if it is unable to terminate the lease, discontinue its use of the asset and continue to make lease payments over the remaining term of the lease without benefit. When the lease will be terminated, the lessee should recognize a liability for the cost of terminating the lease at the time the lease is terminated. If the lease will not be terminated and the lessee will continue to incur costs under the lease without future benefit, the lessee should recognize a liability on the cease-use date (the date the lessee discontinues its use of the asset). In accordance with paragraphs 420-10-30-7 through 30-9, a liability for the remaining lease rentals, reduced by actual (or estimated) sublease rentals, would be recognized and measured at its fair value at the cease-use date. In accordance with paragraphs 420-10-35-1 through 35-4:, the liability would be adjusted for changes, if any, resulting from revisions to estimated cash flows after the cease-use date, measured using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate that was used to measure the liability initially. The fair value estimate at the cease-use date amounts to $0.14 million associated with the release of its manufacturing facility at Concord, Ontario, Canada. This fair value estimate will be re-measured and recorded as a liability at June 30, 2012 the expected cease use date of the facility, any sub-lease or rent earned from the Concord, Ontario, Canada facility in excess of the fair value estimate will be used to offset this liability. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ESW's principal sources of operating capital have been the proceeds from its various financing transactions. During year ended December 31, 2011, the Company used $2,643,776 of cash to sustain operating activities compared with $5,875,140 for year ended December 31, 2010. As of At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,103,649 and $13,328, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended amounted to $2,643,776. This amount was attributable to the net loss of $9,127,088, plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, interest accretion expense, change in fair value of exchange feature liability and others of $5,066,467, and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $1,416,845. Net cash used in operating activities for year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $5,875,140. This amount was attributable to the net loss of $9,447,641, plus non cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, interest and accretion on long term debt, inducement premium on conversion of debentures and others of $6,370,409, and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $2,797,908. Net cash used in investing activities was $252,385 for year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $414,188 used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,000,712 for year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to $5,570,429 for year ended December 31, 2010. In fiscal year 2011, $4,000,000 was provided through the issuance of the notes payable to related parties and $3,857,997 from the issuance of common stock through a rights offering. From the funds raised, $419,410 was paid towards rights offering costs, $3,434,075 was repaid under ESW's CIBC credit facility and $3,800 was repaid under capital lease obligation. In the prior year 2010, $2,919,375 (net of $80,625 debt issuance costs) was provided through issuance of convertible debentures, $3,312,254 in funds was provided by ESW`s bank loan, $576,000 (net of broker fees of $24,000) from the issuance of common stock. From the funds raised in fiscal year 2010, $500,000 was repaid promissory notes to a related party, and $13,769 was repaid under capital lease obligation. 26 ESW operates in a capital intensive and highly regulated industry, where a long lead time to bring new products into market is considered normal. ESW continues to invest in research and development to improve its technologies and bring them to the point where its customers have a high confidence level to purchase our products. During year ended December 31, 2011 and in 2010, ESW did not produce sufficient cash from operations to support its expenditures. Prior financings supported the Company's operations during the period. ESW's principal use of liquidity relates to the Company's working capital needs and to finance any further capital expenditures or tooling needed for production and/or its testing facilities. ESW anticipates certain capital expenditures in 2012 related to the general operation of its business as well as to upgrade the air testing facilities in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania. Overall, capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by our management and reviewed quarterly by the Board of Directors. Effective March 31, 2010, ESWC entered into a demand revolving credit facility agreement with a Canadian chartered bank, CIBC to meet working capital requirements (the "Demand Credit Agreement"). The Demand Credit Agreement had a credit limit of $4 million Canadian. Borrowings under the Demand Credit Agreement were limited to a percentage of accounts receivable plus a percentage of inventories (capped at CAD$ 1 million or 50% of the accounts receivable portion) less any prior ranking claims. Effective May 31, 2011, ESWC entered into a modification of its Demand Credit Agreement dated March 10, 2010 (the "Demand Credit Agreement") whereby it received an extension on the term of its Credit Agreement from its commercial lender through September 30, 2011. The new modification was subject to all covenants and the security margin under the Credit Agreement remaining in order at all times. The commercial lender and the Company agreed to reduce the Operating Loan limit as defined in the Credit Agreement to a maximum of $1,500,000 Canadian or the borrowing base established by the security margin if less; all loans made by the commercial lender were to be satisfied and the credit facilities cancelled upon the earlier of the completion of the Company's rights offering or June 30, 2011. In February 2011, ESW secured $3 million in additional financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes (collectively, "the Notes"). Proceeds of the Notes, along with available cash, will be used to fund working capital, planned capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The Company required additional working capital to secure and deliver the second quarter sales opportunities. On May 3, 2011, the Company secured $1 million in additional financing through certain note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to affiliate shareholders. On June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering. A total of 66,670,012 shares were issued as part of the rights offering and related transactions, $3.9 million was raised in cash and $4.1 million was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Unsecured Subordinated Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) issued to related parties (the “Bridge Lenders”) in February and May of 2011. Under the Rights Offering, shareholders subscribed for 15,590,234 shares for approximately $1.9 million in cash. The Bridge Lenders subscribed for 23,228,970 shares of Common Stock at a price of $0.12 per share, which was paid for through the exchange of principal and accrued interest on the Notes of approximately $2.8 million. Pursuant to backstop commitment, the Bridge Lenders purchased 27,714,385 shares of Common Stock at price of $0.12 per share for approximately $3.3 million, of which $2.0 million was paid in cash and $1.3 million was paid for through the exchange of the balance of principal and accrued interest due on the Notes. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. Effective July 18, 2011, ESWC paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, securities and encumbrances against ESW and its subsidiaries and the March 31, 2010 demand revolving credit facility agreement has been cancelled. ESW has 700,000 Class A special shares, authorized, issued and outstanding, recorded at $453,900 (based on the historical exchange rate at the time of issuance). The Class A special shares are issued by BBL Technologies, Inc. ("BBL") without par value, and are redeemable on demand by the Holder of the shares which is a private Ontario Corporation at $700,000 Canadian (which translates to $688,310 U.S. and $703,801 U.S. at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively). As the redeemable Class A special shares were issued by the BBL, the maximum value upon which the Company is liable is the net book value of BBL. As of December 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, BBL had an accumulated deficit of $1,194,705 U.S. ($1,847,203 Canadian) and $1,192,858 U.S. ($1,845,375 Canadian) respectively, and therefore, the holder would be unable to redeem the redeemable Class A special shares at their ascribed value. 27 Competition is expected to intensify as the market for ESW's products expands. ESW's ability to continue to gain significant market share will depend upon its ability to continue to develop strong relationships with distributors, regulators, customers and develop new products. Increased competition in the market place could result in lower average pricing which could adversely affect ESW's margins and pricing for its products. DEBT STRUCTURE At December 31, 2011 ESW had of $0 of debt on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2010 ESW had a Bank loan of $3,424,889 and Exchange feature liability of $2,133,862. Effective March 19, 2010, the Company issued $3,000,000 of its 9% convertible debentures (the "Debentures") to five (5) accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D. The Debentures were for a term of three (3) years and were convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the holder by dividing the principal amount of the Debenture to be converted by $0.50. The Debentures earned interest at a rate of 9% per annum payable in cash or in shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the holder. If the Holder elected to receive interest in shares of common stock, the number of shares of common stock to be issued for interest would be determined by dividing accrued interest by $0.50. The Debentures had a mandatory conversion feature that required the holders to convert in the event a majority of the Company's pre-existing outstanding 9% convertible debentures converted. Subject to the holder's right to convert and the mandatory conversion feature, the Company had the right to redeem the Debentures at a price equal to one hundred and ten percent (110%) multiplied by the then outstanding principal amount plus unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Upon maturity, the debenture and interest was payable in cash or common stock at the option of the Holder. The Company also had provided the holders of the Debentures registration rights. The Debentures contained customary price adjustment protections. Effective March 25, 2010, the November 2008 and the August 2009 debenture holders agreed to convert all outstanding convertible debentures as per the terms of the respective debenture agreements. The early conversion of the debentures was a condition precedent to the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary ESW Canada entering into a new credit facility with CIBC. The conversion of the November 2008 and the August 2009 debentures also triggered the mandatory conversion feature on the March 19, 2010 debentures. As part of the agreement to convert all existing convertible debentures the Company has paid a share-based premium as an inducement to convert all debentures. The premium was payable to all converting debenture holders and was subject to a positive fairness opinion, provided by a Fairness Committee consisting of independent directors of the Company's Board of Directors, and an increase in the share capital of the Company. The premium consisted of 4,375,665 shares of Common Stock. As the Company did not have sufficient authorized shares as of the date of conversion of the debentures to fulfill the premium, the premium had been recorded as an advance share purchase agreement at fair market value $2,909,872 at June 30, 2010 ($0 at June 30, 2011), the agreement was without interest, subordinated to the banks position and payable in a fixed number of common shares (4,375,665 shares) of the Company upon a subsequent increase in the authorized share capital of the Company. In summary, the fair value of the advanced share subscription was dependent on the market price of the Company's common stock, as the Company did not have sufficient available authorized common shares to fulfill this obligation as on June 30, 2010, it was treated as a liability. The advanced share subscription was re-valued based on the market price of the Company's common stock at the end of each reporting period until it was fulfilled by the issuance of authorized common shares in November 2010. Gains and losses from the resulting revaluations were recognized on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The Share Subscription Agreement for the 2010 Debentures contained an exchange feature. The exchange feature provides that if within twelve months from March 19, 2010, the Company entered into or closed another financing or other transaction (which for securities law purposes would be integrable with the offer and sale of the Securities) on terms and conditions more favorable to another purchaser, the terms and conditions of the 2010 Debentures shall be adjusted to reflect the more favorable terms. On March 31, 2011, the Company re-evaluated the fair value of the exchange feature and determined that the probability of closing another financing was 100% and the conversion price of the 2010 Debentures would be reset. On March 31, 2011 an additional liability of $578,739 was recorded for the exchange feature in these consolidated financial statements with a $578,739 expense related to change in fair value of exchange feature liability recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. On June 30, 2011 concurrent with the closing of the rights offering the exchange feature liability was moved to paid in capital. 28 Effective March 31, 2010 ESWC entered into the Demand Credit Agreement. The Demand Credit Agreement has a credit limit of CAD $4 million. Borrowings under the facility were limited to a percentage of accounts receivable plus a percentage of inventories (capped at CAD $1 million or 50% of the accounts receivable portion) less any prior ranking claims. The Demand Credit Agreement was guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries ESW Canada Inc., ESW America Inc., BBL Technologies Inc., and ESW Technologies Inc., through a general security agreement over all assets to its senior lender. The Demand Credit Agreement had been guaranteed to the bank under the EDC's Export Guarantee Program. Borrowings under the Demand Credit Agreement bear interest at 4.5% above the bank's prime rate of interest. Obligations under the Demand Credit Agreement were collateralized by a first-priority lien on the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including, accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and other tangible and intangible property, including the capital stock of all direct subsidiaries. The terms relating to the Demand Credit Agreement specifically note that the Company maintain a tangible net worth of at least $4.0 million. The Demand Credit Agreement contained, among other things, covenants, representations and warranties and events of default customary for a facility of this type for the Company and its subsidiaries. Such covenants include certain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and other investments, mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, dividends and other repurchases in respect of capital stock, voluntary prepayments of certain other indebtedness, capital expenditures and transactions with affiliates, subject to certain exceptions. Under certain conditions amounts outstanding under the credit agreements may be accelerated. Such events include failure to comply with covenants, breach of representations or warranties in any material respect, non-payment or acceleration of other material debt, entry of material judgments not covered by insurance, or a change of control of the Company. From November 8, 2010 through February 14, 2011, ESWC received waivers of certain financial covenants under the Demand Credit Agreement. Without the waivers, ESWC would not be in compliance with certain covenants in the Demand Credit Agreement. On February 17, 2011, the Company raised a $3 million through the issuance of unsecured subordinated promissory notes. With the proceeds of the Notes, the Company became compliant with covenant obligations under the Demand Credit Agreement with CIBC. Effective July 18, 2011, ESW’s wholly-owned subsidiary ESW Canada Inc, paid its senior lender the amount of $1.5 million (Canadian dollars) from the proceeds of the rights offering to liquidate the outstanding balance on the bank loan. The senior lender has discharged all liens, securities and encumbrances against ESW and its subsidiaries credit facility agreement has been cancelled. As of December 31, 2011, $0 was owed under the Demand Credit Agreement compared to $ 3,424,889 as of December 31, 2010. On February 17, 2011, the Company entered into note subscription agreements (collectively, the "Loan Agreements"), and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes to, nine lenders, who are current shareholders and deemed affiliates of certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Subordinated Lenders"). The Loan Agreements were approved by the independent directors of the Company. As per the Loan Agreements, the Subordinated Lenders made loans to the Company in the principal aggregate amount of $3 million, represented by unsecured subordinated promissory notes (the "Notes"), dated February 17, 2011. Proceeds of the Loan, along with available cash, were used to fund working capital, planned capital investments and other general corporate purposes. The Notes bore interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable in-kind on a monthly basis commencing March 17, 2011, up to the date on which the Note has been paid in full. The maturity date of the Loans was the earlier of: (i) the closing of a rights offering of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share, at a sale price of $0.12 per share ( adjusted for any stock split, stock dividend or other similar adjustment) pursuant to which the Company planned to offer rights to purchase approximately up to $8 million in shares of Common Stock the ("Qualified Offering"), and would also permit all Subordinated Lenders to exchange their Notes, accrued interest (and the any Notes that may be issued for payment of interest) for shares of Common Stock at $0.12 per share or (ii) June 17, 2011 (the "Outside Date"). The Qualified Offering was also been approved by the independent directors of the Company. Subsequently on May 3, 2011, the Company entered into additional note subscription agreements and issued unsecured subordinated promissory notes (the “Bridge Notes”) to, nine lenders, who are current shareholders and were subordinated lenders under prior loan agreements in the aggregate amount of $3 million with the Company entered into February 17, 2011 and may be deemed affiliates of the Company. The Bridge Notes were approved by the Company's independent directors. Pursuant to the Loan agreements, the Subordinated Lenders agreed made loans to the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $1 million subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreements and represented by unsecured subordinated convertible promissory notes, effective as of April 27, 2011. Proceeds of the Bridge Loan, along with available cash, were used by the Company to fund working capital. 29 Effective May 10, 2011, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with Orchard Investments, LLC ("Orchard"); Black Family 1997 Trust; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Alexander Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Benjamin Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Joshua Black; Leon D. Black, UAD 11/30/92 FBO Victoria Black; Leon D. Black; John J. Hannan and Richard Ressler ("Ressler")(each individually a "Bridge Lender" and collectively the "Bridge Lenders"). Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Bridge Lenders agreed to provide a backstop commitment to the Qualified Offering by purchasing from the Company at a subscription price of $0.12 per share of Common Stock any shares not purchased by the Company's shareholders of record who were entitled to participate in the rights offering (after giving effect to any oversubscriptions) up to 29,166,667 shares of Common Stock for a total purchase price of $3.5 million (the "Backstop Commitment"). In addition to their rights to purchase shares pursuant to the Qualified Offering and the Backstop Commitment, the Bridge Lenders have the option, in their sole discretion, to purchase from the Company, at the subscription price, any other shares not purchased by the Company's stockholders through the Qualified Offering (the "Purchase Option"). If, after giving effect to the Qualified Offering, the Backstop Commitment and the Purchase Option, any of the Bridge Lenders shall have been unable to exchange any portion of his or its Notes, the Company will also offer each Bridge Lender the right to purchase additional shares of Common Stock at the subscription price (payable through the exchange of Bridge Loans for Common Stock) such that each Bridge Lender shall have exchanged all of his or its notes for shares of Common Stock (the "Additional Subscription Offer"). In addition, if Ressler and Orchard collectively acquire less than $1.0 million worth of shares of Common Stock as part of the Qualified Offering, the Backstop Commitment, the Purchase Option and the Additional Subscription Offer, the Company has agreed to offer to Ressler and Orchard an additional number of shares of Common Stock equal to the shortfall amount at the subscription price. Effective June 14, 2011, the respective holders of ESW’s 10% unsecured subordinated promissory notes issued February 17, 2011 and May 3, 2011 in the aggregate principal amount of $4 million (collectively the "Notes") pursuant to the terms of the Notes, extended the maturity date of the Notes to July 15, 2011. Effective June 30, 2011, the Company closed its rights offering, as part of the rights offering and the Investment Agreement, the principal due on the Notes and the Bridge Notes in the aggregate amount of $4,000,000 and corresponding interest in the amount of $126,850 were converted into Common stock at the rights offering price of $0.12 per share. As a result of these transactions, the Company satisfied its obligations with respect to the Notes and the Notes were cancelled. ESW's ability to service its future indebtedness, other obligations and commitments in cash will depend on its future performance and ability to raise capital, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, financial, business, regulatory and other factors. Certain of these factors are beyond ESW's control. ESW believes that, based upon its current business plan it will meet its debt service obligations when due. ESW may need additional financing meet its financial projections and obligations. Significant assumptions underlie ESW's projections, including, among other things, that ESW will be successful in implementing its business strategy, that some of ESW's products that have received verification from the appropriate regulatory authorities will obtain customer and market acceptance, and that there will be no material adverse developments in ESW's business, liquidity or capital requirements. If ESW cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness and to meet other obligations and commitments, ESW might be required to refinance or to dispose off assets to obtain funds for such purpose. There is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions or raising funds from sales of equity or otherwise could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In such circumstance, ESW would have to issue shares of its common stock as repayment of these obligations, which would be of a dilutive nature to ESW's present shareholders. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS LEASES Effective November 24, 2004, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESWA, entered into a lease agreement for approximately 40,220 square feet of leasehold space at 2 Bethlehem Pike Industrial Center, Montgomery Township, Pennsylvania. The leasehold space houses the Company's research and development facilities and also houses ESW’s new manufacturing operations. The lease commenced on January 15, 2005 and was to expire January 31, 2010. Effective October 16, 2009, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary ESWA entered into a lease renewal agreement with Nappen & Associates for the leasehold property in Pennsylvania. There were no modifications to the original economic terms of the lease under the lease renewal agreement. Under the terms of the lease renewal, the lease term will now expire February 28, 2013. Effective March 31, 2011, ESWA entered into a lease amendment agreement with Nappen & Associates for the leasehold property in Pennsylvania, whereby ESWA has the sole option to extend the expiry of the lease agreement by an additional 3 years if exercised, six months prior to February 28, 2013; there were no modifications to the original economic terms of the lease. 30 Effective December 20, 2004, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, ESWC, entered into an offer to lease agreement for approximately 50,000 square feet of leasehold space in Concord, Ontario, Canada. The leasehold space houses the Company's executive offices and previously housed the manufacturing operations. The possession of the leasehold space took place on May 24, 2005 and the term of the lease was extended to September 30, 2010. ESWC renewed its lease agreement at the current property for an additional five year term. The renewed lease period commenced on October 1, 2010 and ends on September 30, 2015. The following is a summary of the minimum annual lease payments, for both leases. YEAR 2012 454,642 2013 306,305 2014 283,603 2015 212,703 $1,257,253 LEGAL MATTERS From time to time, the Company may be involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, ESW believes that the resolution of current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on ESW because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect ESW's financial position, results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION The Company is committed to the following lease payments in connection with the acquisition of equipment under capital leases: YEAR 2012 1,259 Less imputed interest (18) Total obligation under capital lease 1,241 Less current portion (1,241) Total long-term portion $ 0 The Company incurred $17 and $2,374 of interest expense on capital lease obligation for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS Restructuring charges relate to changes in the management and reductions in work force of the Company's subsidiary, ESW Canada Inc., hiring, training, moving, relocation charges related to the setup of the new subsidiary, Technology Fabricators Inc. and write downs related to changes in business strategy as a result of the decision to relocate operations. Restructuring expenses consist mainly of severance expenses amounting to $748,155, travel costs of $62,933, legal fees of $26,467, recruiting cost of $34,624, training and set up expenses of $172,748, moving expenses of $40,025, relocation expenses of certain employees of $22,437, write down due to software impairment $133,542, write down due to product line discontinuation $125,113 and other expenses of $19,641. The Company does not expect to incur further expenses related to severance agreements related to the 2011 restructuring plans, but could incur additional restructuring costs related to its Canadian facility. 31 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESW's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, in the United States ("US GAAP"). A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of ESW's financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on ESW's financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates generally require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and if different estimates or judgments were used, the use of these estimates or judgments would have a material effect on ESW's financial condition or results of operations. The estimates and judgments ESW makes that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are based on historical experience and on various other factors, which ESW believes to be reasonable in the circumstances under which they are made. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. ESW considers accounting policies related to revenue recognition, the valuation of inventories, research and development and accounting for the value of long-lived assets and intangible assets to be critical accounting policies. The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements of this 10-K report. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ESW is exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company has foreign currency exposures at its foreign operations related to buying and selling currencies other than the local currencies. The risk under these interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreement is not considered to be significant. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ESW's exposure to foreign currency translation gains and losses also arises from the translation of the assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries to U.S. dollars during consolidation. These risks have been significantly mitigated by the move of ESW’s manufacturing operations to PA USA. During the year, the Company changed the functional currency of its Canadian operations from the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar, see Note 3. Prior to this change, ESW recognized a translation loss of $102,366 in 2011 as compared to a gain of $21,166 in 2010 reported as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity / (deficit). Following the change in accounting policy, ESW recognized a translation loss of $186,812, which is included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Also included in foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2011, ESW has recognized a translation loss of $61,494 as compared to a loss of $103,256 in 2010 primarily as a result of exchange rate differences between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. INTEREST RATE RISK ESW currently has no variable-rate long-term debt that exposes ESW to interest rate risk. 32 ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes accompanied thereto. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP” ). General Discussion: ACOR’s 2011 fiscal year was another challenging year due to the return of flooding conditions covering most of the oil and gas concessions under which the Company holds an interest. Because of the flooding only one well was drilled and completed as a producer during 2011 on the Company’s properties in Australia. ACOR began its movement from being primarily an oil royalty company to an exploration company in 2000 when ACOR et al was awarded three large concessions in South Australia. ACOR entered into a farm-out arrangement with Holloman to drill three wells retaining a 13.8325% Carried Working Interest. During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Holloman drilled the Pecos #1 well on PEL 112 being the first of the three well programs. The Pecos #1 was completed as a Dry Hole. During 2008 Holloman obtained approval from the South Australian Government for new exploration terms giving a new five-year work program for PEL 112 and consolidating PEL 108 & 109 to a new Exploration Permit PEL 444. The Company’s terms and conditions mentioned above are subject to change on these two permits as Holloman is seeking a joint venture partner to expand the work program. For further information on activities on the Company’s properties see "Item 2. Properties". A 12” pipeline was constructed to the Longtom Field with the first delivery of gas beginning on October 21, 2009 on VIC/P54. Revenues from gas sales for the Company begin during the first half of 2010. The Longtom #4 tested 58 million cubic feet of gas per day with liquid hydrocarbons. The net pay section in both Longtom #3 & #4 is 4,000 feet thick and the total depth of both wells was approximately 15,000 feet. ACOR has Overriding Royalty Interests under 10,766,240 gross surface acres in the Cooper/Eromanga and Bass Strait of the Gippsland Basin plus has working interests under 6,507,224 gross surface acres. For additional information regarding these concessions including those mentioned above in this section see "Item 2. Properties". The Company’s management is optimistic about the future drilling planned on its Australian interests, especially for the next couple of years. Results of Operations The Company's oil and gas revenues increased approximately 62% when comparing 2010 to 2011. In 2010 the revenues were $77,652 compared to $125,726 in 2011. The majority of these revenues came from the Company’s ownership in ATP 299 and ATP 267, oil and gas concessions located in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin of Queensland, Australia, and VIC/P54 located in the Bass Strait of Gippsland Basin of Victoria, Australia. The categories of Personnel Costs, Professional fees and Promotion and advertising reported expenditures of $144,840 for 2010 compared to $258,345 for 2011. Of the $144,840 the Company paid $10,000 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2010 and of the $258,345 the Company paid $179,778 through the issuance of unregistered common stock in 2011. The unregistered shares were issued for those services based on the closing stock price at the time of issuance without any discount for their lack of liquidity. The basic allocation of the 2010 Personnel Cost of $58,055 was $39,317 for contract services, $17,141 in wages and $1,600 for officer compensation. The allocation of the 2011 Personnel Cost of $149,432 was $105,494 for contract services, $22,184 in wages, $21,600 for officer compensation and $154 for miscellaneous fees. The Directors’ fees and other operating expense category for 2010 was $5,885 increasing to $52,506 for 2011. No Directors’ fees were awarded in 2010. The other categories of expenditures did not significantly change when comparing the fiscal year ended 2010 to 2011. Other Income (Expense) for the Company includes interest expense of $2,353 for 2010 compared to an interest expense of $5,149 for 2011. Australian income taxes increased from $10,026 in 2010 to $17,925 for 2011, which is directly related to the increase in revenues. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $147,311 compared to a net loss of $262,283 for the year ended December 31, 2011. Per share losses were $0.01 per share for the year ended 2010 and $0.01 per share for 2011. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's Total Current Assets as of December 31, 2010 were $31,337 compared to $56,948 on December 31, 2011. The increase in current assets is due to the increase in cash on hand. The Company’s receivables are due from oil and gas sales earned during the year but were not received on or before the end of the reporting year. The Total Current Liabilities as of December 31, 2010 were $217,211 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 0.14 to 1. The Total Current Liabilities as of December 31, 2011 were $343,564 placing the Company's liquidity ratio of current assets to current liabilities at 0.17 to 1. The slight improvement in liquidity ratio from 2010 to 2011 is directly related to more current assets as of December 31, 2011. The Company plans to meet its operating expenditures from a private placement of its restricted common stock. The Company is seeking exploration partners on its various oil and gas concessions located in Australia. Total assets of the Company increased from $988,302 on December 31, 2010 to $1,227,350 on December 31, 2011, an increase of $239,048. The Company Net Property and Equipment increased from $955,881 in 2010 to $961,727. This increase of $5,846 was attributed to the capital expenditures made on ATP 582, an Australian oil and gas concession. The increase in assets is due to the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Cooper/Eromanga Inc., placing an environmental bond for ATP 582 of $207,591 shown in the financial statements as restricted cash under Other Assets. Total Current Liabilities of the Company increased from $217,211 on December 31, 2011 to $343,564 on December 31, 2011. This increase is due to loans from shareholders of the Company for the environmental bond mentioned above for ATP 582. The accrued expenses of $115,486 and $41,655 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011 respectively were for consulting fees and director’s fees. The $115,486 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2010 is allocated $2,903 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued director’s fees and $76,983 for consulting fees. The $41,655 in accrued expenses reported on December 31, 2011 is allocated $5,298 for accrued interest payable, $35,600 for accrued director’s fees and $757for other fees. Plan of Operation and Funding The Company plans to seek additional oil and gas concessions in Australia on a ground level basis and will seek partners to join in this process. The Company has been successful in entering into farm-out arrangements to defer the exploration commitments on six Australian concessions to joint venture partners and has confidence of being able to repeat this process in the event the Company is successful in acquiring other concessions in Australia. Material Commitments The Company has material financial commitments on several of its working interest properties located in Australia. Concessions PEL 112, 444 and ATP 582 have expenditure requirements that may exceed the Company’s Carried Working Interest in each of these concessions. See "Item 2. Properties" for additional information. Purchase of Significant Equipment The Company does not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months. Subsequent Events: The Company has acquired a 100% Working Interest in PL 18 and PL 40, and a 50% Working Interest in PL 280, located in the Bowen/Surat Basin in Queensland Australia. This basin was home to the first oil discovery in Australia, and is currently the focus of significant coal-seam gas exploration and production activity by others. The assets acquired by the Company include 5 oilfields: Yellowbank Creek, Thomby Creek, Louise, McWhirter, Narrows and Beardmore. These fields were developed in the 1970's and 1980's, and have collectively produced approximately 7-10% of the estimated oil originally in place ("OOIP"). The Company believes that up to 50% of the OOIP is potentially recoverable through the application of well-established enhanced recovery techniques including downspacing, horizontal drilling, and reservoir pressure maintenance through waterflooding. In 2007, the vendors of the Surat assets (the "Vendors") obtained an independent resource report by CDS Data Services Pty Ltd. ("CDS Report") to assess the remaining recoverable oil resources in the 5 fields. The CDS Report provided a range of 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent to 6.7 million barrels of remaining recoverable oil resources. Since 2007, there has been no significant investment in the fields as the Vendors were unsuccessful in securing the necessary capital to develop the remaining oil resources. The fields were recently producing 4 barrels of oil per day (bopd) of high quality 51 degree oil, which is sold at a premium of approximately US$8.50 above Brent crude oil price, or a premium of approximately US$24.00 above West Texas Intermediate crude oil price. The Company currently has 50,000,000 shares of common stock authorized and 49,960,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The Company has agreed to hold an annual and special meeting of shareholders as soon as practicable, in order to, among other things, amend the authorized share capital of the Company to provide for an unlimited number of shares of common stock. Upon such amendments taking effect and in accordance with the terms of the share exchange agreement dated November 17, 2011 (the "Share Exchange Agreement") among ACOR, 1629518 Alberta Ltd. and certain other parties thereto, the Company will issue an additional 69,065 shares of the Company to Bill Petrie Sr, Bill Petrie, Jr, and Jesse Meidl, along with the issuance of 5,000,000 Share Purchase Warrants of ACOR (the "Warrants") to certain persons in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The Warrants will have a strike price of US$0.25 per share, and will only vest if the Company trades at a price above US$1.00 per share for 10 consecutive days, with a total of 100,000 Company shares trading during the 10 day period, and expire 24 months after the date of issuance. The Company has agreed to pay the Vendors US$3.0 million within 12 months of the closing of the Acquisition (the "Deferred Consideration"). The Vendors have secured a first lien over PL 18, PL 40, and PL 280. The Company intends to secure a reserve based lending facility to refinance the Deferred Consideration, which does not accrue interest or other charges within 12 months of closing. The Board of the Company are pleased to add two experienced oil industry executives: William Petrie Sr. and Jesse Meidl. Mr. Petrie has in excess of 35 years' experience as a petroleum geologist, primarily in Western Canada. He began his career with Mobil Oil, leaving after several years to join the independent sector. He has been involved as President and Director for a number of public and private oil and gas companies. In these positions he was responsible for generating, evaluating, and successfully exploiting oil and gas exploration, development, and acquisition opportunities throughout North America. Mr. Meidl has over 15 years of experience in the oil and gas sector. He is Chief Financial Officer of a private international energy company, headquartered in London, England. Prior thereto, he was an investment banker in the International Oil & Gas group of Thomas Weisel Partners in London (Now Stifel Nicolas). Mr. Meidl was previously the Chief Financial Officer for Arsenal Energy Inc., an international exploration company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which held production assets in Canada and the USA and exploration assets in Egypt, Colombia and Uzbekistan. He qualified as a Chartered Accountant with KPMG in Calgary, where he specialized in oil and gas exploration and production and services. He also holds the ICAEW Corporate Finance qualification and a B. Comm. degree from the University of Saskatchewan (Canada). It is planned that during the second quarter of 2012, the Company will be undertaking a workover program of certain wells on PL 40 and PL 280 which will reactivate two old wells at a cost of A$400,000. The workover program is anticipated to bring total field production to approximately 25 barrels of oil per day. The Company will also be obtaining an updated reserve and resource report over all of the assets in the Company's portfolio, including the Surat basin assets and ATP 582. It is anticipated the report will be finalized in the second quarter of 2012. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The FASB established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Codification”) as the source of authoritative GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The codification has changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP guidance is referenced, but did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.” This ASU requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820. ASU 2010-06 amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements. In addition, ASU 2010-06 clarifies the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU 2010-06 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company will comply with the additional disclosures required by this guidance upon its adoption in January 2010. Also in January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03, “Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas—Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures.” This ASU amends the “Extractive Industries—Oil and Gas” Topic of the Codification to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements in this Topic with the SEC’s Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” discussed below. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after December 31, 2009, and the adoption of these provisions on December 31, 2009 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. SEC’s Final Rule on Oil and Gas Disclosure Requirements On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued Release No. 33-8995, “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Requirements (Final Rule),” which revises the disclosures required by oil and gas companies. The SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas companies have been updated to include expanded disclosure for oil and gas activities, and certain definitions have also been changed that will impact the determination of oil and gas reserve quantities. The provisions of this final rule are effective for registration statements filed on or after January 1, 2010, and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009 In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,” related to fair value measurement of liabilities. This update provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more valuation techniques. This guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after issuance. In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 105, “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This guidance established a new hierarchy of GAAP sources for non-governmental entities under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Codification is the sole source for authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting standards in U.S. GAAP, except for those issued by the SEC. The guidance was effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations . In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 855 “Subsequent Events,” which sets forth: (1) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and (3) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. In April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” related to estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. The guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on the Company’s results of operations. Also in April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 825, “Financial Instruments,” which requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies as well as in annual financial statements. This guidance also requires those disclosures in summarized financial information at interim reporting periods. The guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The FASB updated its guidance under ASC 805, “Business Combinations,” in April 2009, which addresses application issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance was effective for business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual period on or after December 15, 2008. In June 2008, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” This guidance clarified that all unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities and provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute basic earnings per share using the two-class method. This guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s earnings per share calculations. In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related items affect an entity’s financial position, operations and cash flows. This guidance was effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009 . Accounting For Natural Gas and Oil Producing Activities We use the full cost method to account for our natural gas and oil producing activities. Under this accounting method, we capitalize substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with the acquisition, development, and exploration of natural gas and oil reserves in full cost pools maintained by geographic areas, regardless of whether reserves are actually discovered and apply a quarterly full cost ceiling test. Adverse changes in conditions (primarily gas price declines) could result in permanent write-downs in the carrying value of oil and gas properties as well as non-cash charges to operations, but would not affect cash flows. Property, Equipment and Depreciation We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to the acquisition of methane, petroleum, and natural gas interests are capitalized. Under this method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include land and lease acquisition costs, annual carrying charges of non-producing properties, geological and geophysical costs, costs of drilling and equipping productive and non-productive wells, and direct exploration salaries and related benefits. Proceeds from the disposal of oil and gas properties are recorded as a reduction of the related capitalized costs without recognition of a gain or loss unless the disposal would result in a change of 20 percent or more in the depletion rate. Depreciation and depletion of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units-of-production method based upon estimates of proved reserves, as determined by independent consultants, with oil and gas being converted to a common unit of measure based on their relative energy content. The costs of acquisition and exploration of unproved oil and gas properties, including any related capitalized interest expense, are not subject to depletion, but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis. The costs of certain unevaluated leasehold acreage are also not subject to depletion. Costs not subject to depletion are periodically assessed for possible impairment or reductions in value. If a reduction in value has occurred, costs subject to depletion are increased or a charge is made against earnings for those operations where a reserve base is not yet established . Estimated future removal and site restoration costs are provided over the life of proven reserves on units-of-production basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards. The charge is included in the provision for depletion and depreciation and the actual restoration expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred. We apply a ceiling test to capitalized costs which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value, using a ten percent discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from production of proven reserves at year end at market prices less future production, administrative, financing, site restoration, and income tax costs plus the lower of cost or estimated market value of unproved properties. If capitalized costs are determined to exceed estimated future net revenues, a write-down of carrying value is charged to depletion in the period. ITEM 7A.

This discussion also provides information about the financial results of the various segments of our business so you may better understand how those segments and their results affect our financial condition and results of operations as a whole. Finally, we have identified and discussed trends known to management that we believe are likely to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the two years then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements. You are also urged to consider the information under the caption "Summary of Critical Accounting Policies." Summary We are the world's largest specialty retailer and wholesale distributor of leather and leathercraft-related items. Our operations are centered on operating retail and wholesale stores. We have built our business by offering our customers quality products in one location at competitive prices. The key to our success is our ability to grow our base business. We grow that business by opening new locations and by increasing sales in our existing locations. We intend to continue to expand both domestically and internationally. We operate in three segments. First, Wholesale Leathercraft, consisting of our Leather Factory stores and our national account sales group, which sells to large national store chains, is our oldest segment with sales of $26.5 million in 2011. Historically, in normal economic conditions, this division has generally offered steady but very modest increases in sales. Sales in 2011 increased 2.4% compared to 2010. Compared to 2010, the wholesale stores’ sales increased 2.3% and national account sales were up 3.9%. Sales at our stores are showing signs of recovery despite cautious consumer spending as a result of the weak U.S. economy. Sales to national accounts tend to be less consistent. Since acquiring its assets in 2000, Tandy Leather has been re-established as the operator of retail leathercraft stores. (Prior to our acquisition in 2000, all of the Tandy Leather retail stores had been closed.) These retail stores comprise our Retail Leathercraft segment. This segment has experienced the greatest increases in sales ($37.4 million in 2011, up from $32.3 million in 2010) and is our largest source of revenues. We expect to grow the number of stores to 100+ from 77 stores in operation at the end of 2011. Our pace of store openings has slowed in the last several years due to the general economic conditions in the U.S. and because of the lack of personnel qualified for store manager positions. We expect to continue to open stores domestically but have not committed to a specific time frame at this point. While the store opening schedule has slowed, we are generally attempting to relocate existing stores as the leases come up for renewal into larger spaces so that a larger amount of product is available to customers. We believe that the increase in sales in this segment suggests that the store relocation strategy is successful. Our International Leathercraft segment consists of company-owned stores located outside of North America. At December 31, 2011, two combination retail/wholesale stores, with one located in the United Kingdom and the other located in Australia, comprised this segment. In January 2012, we opened a store in Spain, bringing the number of stores in this segment to three. It is our intention to open more stores in this segment once we have a large enough customer base to support additional stores. On a consolidated basis, a key indicator of costs, gross margin as a percent of total net sales, increased in 2010 and in 2011. Operating expenses increased at a slightly slower pace than that of sales, increasing 10% between 2010 and 2011 and 8% between 2009 and 2010. We reported consolidated net income for 2011 of $4.7 million. Consolidated net income for 2010 and 2009 was $4.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively. We use our cash flow to fund our operations, to fund the opening of new stores, to purchase necessary property and equipment and to make acquisitions of small competitors in the retail and wholesale market. In 2007, we incurred $4.0 million in bank debt to purchase a 191,000 square foot building to house our corporate headquarters and central support units. We moved into that facility in the first quarter of 2008. In 2010, we paid a one-time dividend to our stockholders, totaling $7.7 million. At the end of 2011, our stockholders’ equity had increased to $34.4 million from $29.8 million the previous year. Comparing the December 31, 2011 balance sheet with the prior year’s balance sheet, we decreased our investment in inventory from $20.2 million to $19.9 million, while total cash (including certificates of deposit) increased from $5.9 million to $11.2 million. 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net Sales Net sales for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company Incr from Prior Year 2011 $26,540,899 $37,435,832 $2,126,216 $66,102,947 10.4% 2010 $25,908,177 $32,291,442 $1,693,251 $59,892,870 9.9% 2009 $25,095,392 $28,079,863 $1,307,484 $54,482,739 3.8% Our net sales increased by 10.4% in 2011 when compared with 2010 and increased by 9.9% in 2010 when compared with 2009. In 2011 and 2010, all three segments reported sales increases compared to the prior year. Costs and Expenses In general, our gross profit as a percentage of sales (our gross margin) fluctuates based on the mix of customers we serve, the mix of products we sell and our ability to source products globally. Our negotiations with suppliers for lower pricing are an on-going process, and we have varying degrees of success in those endeavors. Sales to retail customers tend to produce higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers due to the difference in pricing levels. Therefore, as retail sales increase in the overall sales mix, higher gross margins tend to follow. Finally, there is significant fluctuation in gross margins between the various merchandise categories we offer. As a result, our gross margins can vary depending on the mix of products sold during any given time period. For 2011, our cost of sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to 2010, resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from 60.5% to 61.0%. Our 2010 cost of sales as a percentage of our total net sales decreased as a percentage of total net sales when compared to 2009, resulting in an increase in consolidated gross profit margin from 59.9% to 60.5%. Fluctuations in gross margin are primarily due to sales mix. Retail sales are at a higher gross margin than that of wholesale sales. Therefore, as retail sales increase at a faster pace than that of wholesale sales, gross margin increases accordingly. Our gross margins for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Year Wholesale Leathercraft Retail Leathercraft International Leathercraft Total Company 2011 61.3% 60.5% 66.9% 61.0% 2010 60.7% 60.2% 63.8% 60.5% 2009 58.5% 60.9% 63.6% 59.9% Our operating expenses decreased minimally as a percentage of total net sales to 49.4% in 2011 when compared with 49.5% in 2010. This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew slightly slower than our sales during this period. 2011 operating expenses were $3.0 million higher than those of 2010. Significant expense fluctuations in 2011 compared to 2010 are as follows: Expense 2011 amount Incr (Decr) over 2010 Employee compensation & benefits $18.0 million $2.1 million Travel expense 330,000 (50,000) Credit card fees 910,000 100,000 Rent & utilities 4.0 million 190,000 Professional fees and licenses 1.4 million 600,000 Freight out – shipping product to customers 1.7 million 120,000 The increase in employee compensation and benefits is due primarily to the increase in store manager compensation. Our store managers are paid a percentage of the operating profit generated by the store they manage as additional compensation, so as store profits increase, manager compensation increases. Also included in benefits is our employee health benefit plan which has seen consistent cost increases compared to prior years. Our operating expenses decreased 1.0% as a percentage of total net sales to 49.5% in 2010 when compared with 50.5% in 2009. This decrease indicates that our operating expenses grew more slowly than our sales during this period. 2010 operating expenses were $2.1 million higher than those of 2009. Significant expense fluctuations in 2010 compared to 2009 are as follows: Expense 2010 amount Incr (Decr) over 2009 Employee compensation & benefits $15.9 million $1.4 million Travel expense 380,000 180,000 Credit card fees 820,000 130,000 Rent & utilities 3.7 million 300,000 Professional fees and licenses 800,000 100,000 Freight out – shipping product to customers 1.6 million 270,000 Loss on disposal of equipment 50,000 (300,000) Other Income/Expense (net) Other Income/Expense consists primarily of currency exchange fluctuations, interest income and interest expense. In 2011, we had other expense (net) of $165,000 compared to other expense (net) of $160,000 in 2010. We received $16,000 in gas royalties. We earned $34,000 in interest income on our cash and paid $248,000 in interest expense on our bank debt. We had a currency exchange loss of $200 in 2011 compared to $187,000 in 2010. In 2010, we had other expense (net) of $160,000 compared to other expense (net) of $134,000 in 2009. We received $38,000 in gas royalties. We earned $73,000 in interest income on our cash and paid $265,000 in interest expense on our bank debt. We had a currency exchange loss of $187,000 in 2010 compared to $98,000 in 2009. Net Income During 2011, we earned net income of $4.7 million, a 14% increase over our net income of $4.2 million earned during 2010. The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses and income tax expense. During 2010, we earned net income of $4.2 million, a 25% increase over our net income of $3.3 million earned during 2009. The increase in net income was the result of the increase in sales and gross profit, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. 11 TABLE OF CONTENTS Wholesale Leathercraft The increases (or decreases) in net sales, operating income, operating income increases (or decreases) and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Wholesale Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows: Year Net Sales Incr (Decr) from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income Incr (Decr) from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales 2011 2.4% $2,803,034 4.2% 10.6% 2010 3.2% $2,690,061 33.3% 10.4% 2009 (5.3)% $2,017,915 13.2% 8.0% Wholesale Leathercraft, consisting of our 29 wholesale stores and our national account group, accounted for 40.2% of our consolidated net sales in 2011, which compares to 43.3% in 2010 and 45.6% in 2009. The decrease in this division's contribution to our total net sales is the result of the growth in Retail Leathercraft, and we expect this trend to continue while retail consumers’ buying patterns continue to strengthen over that of wholesale and small businesses. Sales in the wholesale stores increased 2.2% in 2011 compared to sales in 2010 while the sales increase in our national account group was 3.9% from 2010 to 2011. By customer group, we increased sales in the wholesale stores significantly to our retail customers while sales to our wholesale and national account customers remained consistent with 2010. The most significant decreases were in our institution and manufacturer groups which have been significantly affected by the weakness in the U.S. economy. Our sales mix by customer group in the Wholesale Leathercraft division was as follows: Customer Group 2011 2010 2009 Retail 33% 31% 29% Institution 5% 6% 7% Wholesale 43% 43% 42% National Accounts 12% 12% 15% Manufacturers 7% 8% 7% 100% 100% 100% In 2011, operating income as a percentage of divisional sales remained consistent with the prior year at 10.5%. Significant operating expense increases occurred in employee compensation ($325,000), employee benefits ($490,000), and supplies ($73,000), offset somewhat by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses ($353,000) and bad debt expenses ($130,000). The 2010 increase in operating income as a percentage of divisional sales resulted from a decrease in operating expenses of $200,000. Significant operating expense decreases occurred in loss on disposal of equipment ($325,000), depreciation ($35,000) and bad debts ($75,000), offset somewhat by increases in employee compensation ($200,000) and travel expenses ($50,000). Retail Leathercraft The increases in net sales, operating income, operating income increases (or decreases) and operating income as a percentage of sales from our Retail Leathercraft stores for the three years ended December 31, 2010 were as follows: Year Net Sales Increase from Prior Yr Operating Income Operating Income Incr (Decr) from Prior Year Operating Income as a Percentage of Sales 2011 15.9% $4,656,067 28.8% 12.4% 2010 15.0% $3,614,856 24.6% 11.2% 2009 11.3% $2,900,701 32.6% 10.3% Reflecting the growth previously discussed, Retail Leathercraft accounted for 56.6% of our total net sales in 2011, up from 53.9% in 2010 and 51.1% in 2009. Growth in net sales for our Retail Leathercraft division in 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in same store sales. Our sales mix by customer group in the Retail Leathercraft division was as follows: Customer Group 2011 2010 2009 Retail 62% 64% 65% Institution 5% 6% 7% Wholesale 30% 29% 27% National Accounts 0% 0% 0% Manufacturers 3% 1% 1% 100% 100% 100% Operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 12.4% for 2011 compared to 11.2% for 2010. Gross margin increased slightly to 60.5% in 2011 from 60.2% in 2010. Operating expenses as a percent of sales in 2011 decreased from 49.0% for 2010 to 48.0% for 2011 as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than that of sales. Operating income as a percentage of sales increased to 11.2% for 2010 compared to 10.3% for 2009. Gross margin decreased slightly to 60.2% in 2010 from 60.9% in 2009. Operating expenses as a percent of sales in 2010 decreased by 1.6%, from 50.6% for 2009 to 49.0% for 2010 as operating expenses grew at a slower pace than that of sales. We intend to continue the expansion of Tandy Leather’s retail store chain over the next several years, with plans to open at least one store in 2012 in North America. We remain committed to a conservative expansion plan for this division that minimizes risks to our profits and maintains financial stability. In the current economic environment in the U.S., it is possible that we will change our plans for store openings in 2012 if we determine that feasibility of additional successful openings is likely. International Leathercraft International Leathercraft consists of all stores located outside of North America. As of December 31, 2011, that represents two retail/wholesale combination stores with one located in the United Kingdom and the other in Australia. A third store was opened in January 2012, located in Spain. International Leathercraft accounted for 3.2%, 2.8% and 2.4% of our total sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Operating income was $248,000, $331,000 and $176,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We expect this segment to become a larger part of our total operations as our international customer base continues to grow. We intend to expand our International Leathercraft segment by opening one to two new stores in 2012. We opened a store in Spain in January 2012 and anticipate another store opening in the last half of the year. The number and timing of store openings will be subject to compliance with all local legal requirements, lease negotiations and execution and completion of the finish out of the stores. 12 TABLE OF CONTENTS Financial Condition At December 31, 2011, we held $11.2 million of cash and certificates of deposit, $19.9 million of inventory, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and $10.3 million of property and equipment. Goodwill and other intangibles (net of amortization and depreciation) were $987,000 and $187,000, respectively. Net total assets were $45.5 million. Current liabilities were $7.1 million (including $203,000 of current maturities of long-term debt), while long-term debt was $3.1 million. Total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2011 was $34.4 million. At December 31, 2010, we held $5.9 million of cash and certificates of deposit, $20.2 million of inventory, accounts receivable of $1.3 million, and $10.3 million of property and equipment. Goodwill and other intangibles (net of amortization and depreciation) were $990,000 and $232,000, respectively. Net total assets were $40.6 million. Current liabilities were $6.9 million (including $203,000 of current maturities of long-term debt), while long-term debt was $3.3 million. Total stockholders’ equity at the end of 2010 was $29.8 million. Specific ratios on a consolidated basis at the end of each year ended December 31 were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Solvency Ratios: Quick Ratio (Cash+Accts Rec)/Total Current Liabilities 1.76 1.04 2.44 Current Ratio Total Current Assets/Total Current Liabilities 4.74 4.17 5.55 Current Liabilities to Net Worth Total Current Liabilities/Net Worth 0.21 0.23 0.17 Current Liabilities to Inventory Total Current Liabilities/Inventory 0.36 0.34 0.34 Total Liabilities to Net Worth Total Liabilities/Net Worth 0.32 0.36 0.30 Fixed Assets to Net Worth Fixed Assets/Net Worth 0.30 0.35 0.29 Efficiency Ratios: Collection Period (Days Outstanding) Accounts Receivable/Credit Sales x 365 42.35 39.83 37.22 Inventory Turnover Sales/Average Inventory 3.29 3.23 3.35 Assets to Sales Total Assets/Sales 0.69 0.68 0.79 Sales to Net Working Capital Sales/Current Assets - Current Liabilities 2.49 2.74 2.09 Accounts Payable to Sales Accounts Payable/Sales 0.03 0.02 0.02 Profitability Ratios: Return on Sales (Profit Margin) Net Profit After Taxes/Sales 0.07 0.07 0.06 Return on Assets Net Profit After Taxes/Total Assets 0.10 0.10 0.08 Return on Net Worth (Return on Equity) Net Profit After Taxes/Net Worth 0.14 0.14 0.10 Capital Resources and Liquidity On July 31, 2007, we entered into a Credit Agreement and Line of Credit Note with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to which the bank agreed to provide us with a credit facility of up to $5,500,000 to facilitate our purchase and remodel of real estate consisting of a 191,000 square foot building situated on 30 acres of land located at 1900 SE Loop 820 in Fort Worth, Texas. Proceeds in the amount of $4,050,000 were used to fund the initial purchase of the property. On April 30, 2008, that amount was rolled into a ten-year term note, and we began making monthly debt service payments in May 2008. We are currently in compliance with all covenants and conditions contained in the JPMorgan Chase Credit Agreement and have no reason to believe that we will not continue to operate in compliance with the provisions of these financing arrangements. The principal terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement are described in further detail in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt. Reflecting the borrowing and reduction of bank indebtedness as well as dividend payments during the periods, our financing activities for 2011, 2010 and 2009 required net cash of $0.2 million, $8.2 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. The one-time, special dividend paid in July 2010 of $7.7 million is the reason for the significant increase in financing activities in 2010 compared to 2011 and 2009. Our primary source of liquidity and capital resources during 2011 was cash flow provided by operating activities. Net cash flow from operations for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $6.6 million, $2.7 million, and $5.3 million, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2010 was due to the increase in inventory in the last half of 2010. In 2011, cash flow from operations was generated from income, the decrease in inventory and increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable and the decrease in accrued expenses. In 2010 and 2009, cash flow from operations was generated from income, partially offset by the increase in inventory. Consolidated accounts receivable increased $75,000 to $1.3 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. Average days to collect accounts increased from 40 days in 2010 to 42 days in 2011 on a consolidated basis. We maintain a tight credit policy and are aggressively monitoring our customer accounts to ensure collectability. We believe the trend in our collections is the result of the overall slowdown in the U.S. economy. Many of our customers with open accounts are very small businesses, and they tend to feel the effects of an economic slowdown more severely than larger businesses. Inventory decreased from $20.2 million at the end of 2010 to $19.9 million at December 31, 2011. We are pleased with the slight reduction in our inventory investment at December 31, 2011. However, as we continue our store expansion and relocation, we expect our inventory to increase. Further, continued sales increases are partially dependent on product availability in our stores. We will continue to look for large purchasing opportunities of product at aggressive pricing in order to support our gross margin goals. We attempt to manage our inventory levels to avoid tying up excessive capital while maintaining sufficient inventory in order to service our current customer demand as well as plan for our expected expansion. We ended the year with our total inventory on hand approximately 10% below our internal targets for optimal inventory. Consolidated inventory turned 3.29 times during 2011, a slight improvement from the 2010 turns at 3.23 times. We compute our inventory turnover rates as sales divided by average inventory. By operating division, inventory turns are as follows: Segment 2011 2010 2009 Wholesale Leathercraft 1.95 1.96 2.18 Retail Leathercraft 6.41 6.45 6.13 International Leathercraft 6.91 5.65 3.95 Wholesale Leathercraft stores only 6.68 7.40 6.82 Retail Leathercraft inventory turns are significantly higher than that of Wholesale Leathercraft because its inventory consists only of the inventory at the stores. The retail stores have no warehouse (backstock) inventory to include in the turnover computation as the stores get their product from the central warehouse. Wholesale Leathercraft’s turns are expected to be slower because the central warehouse inventory is part of this division, and its inventory is held as the backstock for all of the stores. Accounts payable totaled $1.6 million at the end of 2011, up from $1.2 million at the end of 2010. 13 TABLE OF CONTENTS As discussed above, the largest use of operating cash in 2011 was the decrease in accrued expenses, specifically the decrease in the amount of inventory in transit. Cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $1.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, the primary capital expenditure was store fixtures, either for new stores or for relocated or remodeled stores. Fixtures and equipment for the new international stores totaled $225,000. We moved or remodeled 14 stores in the US in 2011. Fixtures for those stores totaled $310,000. Fixtures for the new U.S. store opened in 2011 totaled $15,000. Other capital expenditures were building improvements, including a video surveillance system ($112,000), computer equipment ($240,000), website development ($70,000) and factory machines and dies ($35,000). In 2010, the primary capital expenditure was the construction of a building to be used for the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and the staging of drop-shipments of specially purchased product to our stores ($950,000). Other capital expenditures were building improvements, including a generator ($110,000), store fixtures ($153,000), computer equipment ($200,000), and factory machines and dies ($62,000). We intend to open one to two stores in the U.S. and one to two stores abroad in 2012, having already opened one store in Spain in January 2012, and therefore we expect to incur some capital expenditures related to these store openings, In addition, we intend to continue to relocate US stores into larger space as leases permit and therefore, expect to incur capital expenditures, namely fixtures, related to these moves. Therefore, we expect our 2012 capital expenditures to be comparable to that of our 2011 expenditures. Cash applied toward stock repurchases totaled $441,419 and $1,624,264 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no stock repurchases in 2011. We believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our operations in 2012, while also funding our expansion plans. At this time, we know of no trends or demands, commitments events or uncertainties that will or are likely to materially affect our liquidity, capital resources or results of operations. In addition, we anticipate that this cash flow will enable us to meet the contractual obligations and commercial commitments. We could defer expansion plans if required by unanticipated drops in cash flow. In particular, because of the relatively small investment required by each new store, we have flexibility in when we make most expansion expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements during 2011, 2010 and 2009, and we do not currently have any such arrangements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes by years our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011 (not including related interest expense): Payments Due by Periods Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 -5 Years More than 5 Years Long-Term Debt(1) $3,307,500 $202,500 $405,000 $405,000 $2,295,000 Operating Leases(2) 7,448,982 2,738,498 3,319,822 1,379,600 11,062 Total Contractual Obligations $10,756,482 $2,940,998 $3,724,822 $1,784,600 $2,306,062 ____________________ (1) Our loan from JPMorgan Chase matures in May 2018.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies We strive to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology. We follow generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. in preparing our consolidated financial statements. These principles require us to make estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. We continually review our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements. Basis of Consolidation. We report our financial information on a consolidated basis. Therefore, unless there is an indication to the contrary, financial information is provided for the parent company, Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., and its subsidiaries as a whole. Transactions between the parent company and any subsidiaries are eliminated for this purpose. We own all of the capital stock of our subsidiaries, and we do not have any subsidiaries that are not consolidated. None of our subsidiaries are “off balance sheet.” Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for retail (over the counter) sales as transactions occur and other sales upon shipment of our products, provided that there are no significant post-delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured, which generally occurs upon shipment. Net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances, product returns, and allowances for defective merchandise. Allowance for Accounts Receivable. We reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. This allowance is an estimate based primarily on our evaluation of the customer's financial condition, past collection history, and the aging of the account. If the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment or inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is accounted for on the “first in, first out” method. This means that sales of inventory treat the oldest item of identical inventory as being the first sold. In addition, we regularly reduce the value of our inventory for slow-moving or obsolete inventory. This reduction is based on our review of items on hand compared to their estimated future demand. If actual future demand is less favorable than what we project, additional write-downs may be necessary. Goods shipped to us are recorded as inventory owned by us when the risk of loss shifts to us from the supplier. Goodwill. We periodically analyze the remaining goodwill on our balance sheet to determine the appropriateness of its carrying value. As of December 31, 2011, we determined that the present value of the discounted estimated future cash flows of the operating divisions associated with the goodwill is sufficient to support their respective goodwill balances. If actual financial performance of these divisions differs significantly from our projections, such difference could affect the present value calculation in the future resulting in an impairment of all or part of the goodwill currently carried on our balance sheet. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the SEC, or in other written or oral statements made or to be made by us, other than statements of historical fact, are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Words such as “may,” “assume,” “forecast,” “position,” “predict,” “strategy,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “project,” “budget,” “potential,” or “continue,” and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements. They can be affected by assumptions used or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, no forward-looking statements can be guaranteed. Actual results may vary materially. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and you should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risk factors described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements. 14 TABLE OF CONTENTS ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We face exposure to financial market risks, including adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. These exposures may change over time and could have a material impact on our financial results. We do not use or invest in market risk sensitive instruments to hedge any of these risks or for any other purpose. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our foreign subsidiaries as those subsidiaries have local currency revenue and local currency operating expenses. Changes in the foreign currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of revenue and expenses. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information , for financial information concerning our foreign activities. Interest Rate Risk In the past, we have been subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on certain outstanding debt. However, our current credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase includes a fixed interest rate. Therefore, changes in the prime rate do not impact us in this area. 15 TABLE OF CONTENTS ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[ The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. The purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to provide an overview of the business to help facilitate an understanding of significant factors influencing our historical operating results, financial condition and cash flows and also to convey our expectations of the potential impact of known trends, events, or uncertainties that may impact our future results. The discussion and analysis in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and adequacy of resources. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward looking statements. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of these words, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the integration of our acquired technologies with our existing technology, the commercial launch of new products and the duration which our existing cash and other resources is expected to fund our operating activities. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Item 1: Business”; “Item 1A: Risk Factors”; “Item 6: Selected Financial Data”; and “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Overview We develop, manufacture and sell products and services for genetic analysis to the life science research and clinical healthcare markets. Researchers around the world use our technology to better understand the role that genes play in disease, the effectiveness and safety of therapies and many other biological factors that affect human well-being. We sell our products to some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical, diagnostic and biotechnology companies, as well as leading academic, government and not-for-profit research institutions and more than 24,000 peer-reviewed papers have been published based on work using our products. We have almost 900 employees worldwide and maintain sales and distribution operations across the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. We offer a comprehensive line of products for two principal applications: gene expression and genotyping. Our product sales consist primarily of sales of instruments and related consumables. We have three instrument systems, GeneTitan®, GeneChip® and GeneAtlas™, that include instruments, consumables and software. Our GeneChip® instruments run arrays packaged in cartridges and our GeneTitan® and GeneAtlas TM instruments run arrays packaged in a peg format. We also offer a variety of assays for gene expression targeting low- to mid-plex markets that are downstream of our whole genome arrays and a range of reagent kits that are compatible with our platforms as well as the products of other vendors. Overview of Fiscal Year 2011 and Strategic Initiatives In 2011, our business was affected by a significant drop in the volume of sales of consumables to our academic and pharmaceutical customers, particularly in North America, which led to a decrease in revenue as compared to the same period in 2010. Primarily due to lower revenues from product sales, we incurred a net loss of $28.2 million for the year. Despite the lower revenues, we were able to generate cash flows from operations of almost $40 million in 2011. Our focus remains on carrying out the following strategic initiatives: Entering new markets and expanding our product lines. Our goal continues to be to expand our revenue base by entering new markets, growing our customer base and successfully commercializing our established and acquired technologies. In the future, we intend to continue to expand our focus to include the validation and routine testing markets which we believe offer attractive compound annual growth rates and opportunities for more recurring revenue growth in the future. We seek to expand our product line with new products that combine automated instrumentation, powerful new biological assays, and new array designs and content. 31 Table of Contents Improving operating leverage. We remain focused on improving our operating leverage and were successful in lowering our operating expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Profitability in the future will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to, increasing top-line revenue and sustained operating leverage. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES & ESTIMATES General The following section of  is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are fully described in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” However, certain accounting policies are particularly important to the reporting of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. REVENUE RECOGNITION We enter into contracts to sell our products and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and if so, how the value of the arrangement should be allocated among the deliverable elements, when and how to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized. INVENTORIES We enter into inventory purchases and commitments so that we can meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products. The business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand. We perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period, which includes a review of, among other factors, demand requirements, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, product expiration and quality issues. Based on this analysis, we record adjustments to inventory for potentially excess, obsolete or impaired goods, when appropriate, in order to report inventory at net realizable value. These inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand, component costs, supplier arrangements, or product life cycles differ from our estimates. Any such adjustments would result in a charge to our results of operations . NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES As part of our strategic efforts to gain access to potential new products and technologies, we invest in equity securities of certain private biotechnology companies. These investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are carried at cost. We also invest in a limited partnership investment fund that is accounted for under the equity method. We periodically review our investments for impairment; however, the impairment analysis requires significant judgment in identifying events or circumstances that would likely have significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. The analysis may include assessment of the investee’s (i) revenue and earnings trend, (ii) business outlook for its products and technologies, (iii) liquidity position and the rate at which it is using its cash, and (iv) likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing. If an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying value, we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired. We have experienced impairments in our portfolio due to the decline in the value of certain of our non-marketable investments over the past few years. 32 Table of Contents INCOME TAXES Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We must assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance. Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. We believe that our estimates are reasonable and that our reserves for income tax related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in overall levels, character, or geographical mix of pretax earnings, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, future levels of research and development spending, nondeductible expenses, applicability of tax holidays, and ultimate outcomes of income tax audits. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 was approximately $16.5 million. If recognized, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact income tax expense is $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, we do not anticipate any material changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit during the next twelve months. We classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as components of income tax expense. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties was approximately $0.2 million for a total cumulative amount of $0.7 million of non-current income taxes payable as of December 31, 2011. We file U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. During November 2011, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service completed its field examination of our federal income tax returns for the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 tax years and issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, or RAR, with no proposed adjustments. We consider all tax positions taken in the 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 tax years to be effectively settled, because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has completed its examination procedures and we believe that there is a remote possibility that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will re-examine the settled positions. As a result, we have released reserves of approximately $5.8 million related to uncertain tax positions for those periods and recorded a full valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. However, the federal and California statute of limitations on assessment still remain open for the tax years 1992 through 2011. In significant foreign jurisdictions, the 2006 through 2011 tax years generally remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities. CONTINGENCIES We are subject to legal proceedings principally related to intellectual property matters. Based on the information available at the balance sheet dates, we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses. If losses are probable and reasonably estimable, we will record a reserve which may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION We account for employee share-based compensation by estimating the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected term, volatility and forfeiture rates of the awards. The expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of historical and implied volatility of our common stock. We determined that blended volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. The estimate of these key assumptions is based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. As required under the accounting rules, we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and, as a result, we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee share-based awards granted in future periods. 33 Table of Contents US GAAP requires that employee share-based compensation costs be recognized over the requisite service period, or the vesting period, in a manner similar to all other forms of compensation paid to employees. Accordingly, in 2011, we recognized employee share-based compensation of $8.8 million, which consisted of $1.1 million in cost of product sales, $1.9 million in research and development expense and $5.8 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2011, $16.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested employee stock awards is expected to be recognized as future cost of sales and operating expenses over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. PRODUCT SALES The components of product sales are as follows: Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Consumables $ 224,972 $ 252,165 $ 255,660 $ (27,193 ) $ (3,495 ) (11 )% (1 )% Instruments 16,301 25,578 23,526 (9,277 ) 2,052 (36 ) 9 Total product sales $ 241,273 $ 277,743 $ 279,186 $ (36,470 ) $ (1,443 ) (13 ) (1 ) Total product sales decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to volume decreases. Chip volumes shipped were lower across all products while overall average selling price remained flat. Reagent revenue decreased primarily due to lower volume Genechip® shipments combined with lower average selling price caused by a shift in product mix. Instruments were lower due to fewer GeneTitan® sales partially offset by increased sales of the lower-priced GeneAtlas™. Total product sales decreased $1.4 million or 1% in 2010 as compared to 2009. Consumables sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in the sales of our RNA reagents partially offset by an increase in sales of our DNA reagents. In both areas, sales of our lower price products have increased as a percentage of the total mix. Instrument sales grew in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the increased adoption of GeneTitan® and introduction of GeneAtlas TM families of instruments, which were introduced in late 2009 and early 2010, respectively, partially offset by declines in the volume of sales of older instruments. SERVICES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Services $ 20,158 $ 20,565 $ 39,563 $ (407 ) $ (18,998 ) (2 )% (48 )% Total services revenue remained consistent in 2011 as compared to 2010 which was in line with our expectations. Total services revenue decreased in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the completion in late 2009 of several genotyping projects that began in the fourth quarter of 2008, including the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and the National Institutes of Health projects. 34 Table of Contents ROYALTY AND OTHER REVENUE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Royalties and other revenue $ 6,043 $ 12,438 $ 8,345 $ (6,395 ) $ 4,093 (51 )% 49 % Royalties and other revenue in 2010 was higher as compared to 2011 and 2009 primarily due to the receipt of a non-recurring $4.8 million license payment that was received in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to the non-recurring license payment, royalties and other revenue was lower in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to lower royalties and research activity. PRODUCT AND SERVICES GROSS MARGINS Dollars in thousands Dollar/Point Year ended December 31, change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 Total gross margin on product sales $ 143,458 $ 160,359 $ 152,809 $ (16,901 ) $ 7,550 Total gross margin on services 7,021 4,743 15,614 2,278 (10,871 ) Product gross margin as a percentage of product sales 59 % 58 % 55 % 1 3 Service gross margin as a percentage of services 35 % 23 % 39 % 12 (16 ) Despite lower product sales in 2011, product gross margin as a percentage of product sales increased during the year as compared to 2010 primarily due to a mix shift to higher margin products along with lower material, warranty and excess and obsolescence costs in 2011 as well as plant consolidation costs that occurred in 2010. These cost improvements were partially offset by lower cost absorption due to higher production levels in 2010. We note a downward trend in product gross margin within 2011 when comparing quarterly results driven by increased absorption cost due to lower sales. Product gross margin increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in plant consolidation costs from $9.4 million in 2009 to $1.6 million in 2010, as the majority of the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure took place in 2009. Additionally, favorable pricing and absorption in chips contributed to the increased product margin. These increases were partially offset by higher excess and obsolescence costs for products with finite lives. Service gross margin increased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to costs associated with the West Sacramento manufacturing facility closure that was completed in the second quarter of 2010. Service gross margin was lower in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of the Wellcome Trust Case Consortium and National Institutes of Health projects which had higher margins and were completed in 2009. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Research and development $ 63,591 $ 67,934 $ 77,358 $ (4,343 ) $ (9,424 ) (6 )% (12 )% Research and development expenses decreased in 2011 and 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to savings in head count-related expenses and variable compensation of $3.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively and decreased spending on supplies of $2.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively as a result of cost-control measures. This was partially offset by an increase in facilities expenses primarily due to a one-time expense of $1.2 million related to the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara during the third quarter of 2011. 35 Table of Contents SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Selling, general and administrative $ 109,572 $ 114,773 $ 130,838 $ (5,201 ) $ (16,065 ) (5 )% (12 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to lower legal expenses of $4.2 million as a result of a litigation settlement at the end of 2010. Other cost savings include variable compensation adjustments of $1.6 million, lower spending on consulting and other services of $1.5 million and advertising expenses of $0.8 million. These savings were partially offset by one-time severance benefits provided to our former chief executive officer of $1.4 million, rent expense of $1.8 million primarily due to the acceleration of future lease payments as a result of the plant consolidation activities of our Oakmead facility in Santa Clara and acquisition costs of $2.9 million incurred on the anticipated eBioscience transaction. In 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to 2009 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expenses of $11.0 million as a result of lower headcount and decreased variable compensation. Additionally, legal expenses decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to timing of legal proceedings with third-parties, consulting and purchased services decreased by $1.8 million as a result of various general and administrative cost reductions, and rent expense decreased by $1.4 million due primarily to the relocation of our Japan office and other site consolidation efforts. INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET The components of interest income and other, net, are as follows: Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Interest income $ 2,627 $ 2,845 $ 4,455 $ (218 ) $ (1,610 ) (8 )% (36 )% Realized loss on equity investments, net (2,251 ) (4,342 ) (916 ) 2,091 (3,426 ) 48 (374 ) Currency loss, net (2,483 ) (48 ) (2,800 ) (2,435 ) 2,752 (5,073 ) 98 Other (4,195 ) 58 1,850 (4,253 ) (1,792 ) (7,333 ) (97 ) Total interest income and other, net $ (6,302 ) $ (1,487 ) $ 2,589 $ (4,815 ) $ (4,076 ) 324 (157 ) Interest income and other, net decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to the following: · Realized loss on equity investments decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 as we recognized fewer other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”). In 2011, we recognized $2.1 million in OTTI on our non-marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund, a non-marketable investment in a private biotechnology company and an investment classified as available-for-sale in a publicly-traded company. In 2010, we recognized $5.6 million in OTTI on two non-marketable investments; · Currency loss, net, increased primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro in 2011 as compared to 2010; and · Other changed in 2011 due to a $2.2 million provision against a note receivable from a private biotechnology company and a $1.7 million impairment charge recorded against our West Sacramento facility during 2011. 36 Table of Contents Interest income and other, net changed by $4.1 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to the following: · Interest income decreased by $1.6 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 due to lower average cash and investment balances as a result of the repurchase of a portion of our 3.50% convertible notes during 2010, partially offset by higher effective interest rates in 2010; · Realized loss in equity investments increased by $3.4 million in 2010 as we recognized $5.6 million of other-than-temporary impairment expense, largely as a result of our recognition of impairment charges on two non-marketable investments. This was partially offset by a net realized gain from our investment in a limited partnership investment fund of $1.3 million. In 2009, we recognized a net realized loss of $0.9 million primarily due to OTTI on our non-marketable investment in a limited partnership investment fund; · Currency loss decreased in 2010 by $2.8 million due to favorable currency movements in 2010; and · Other income decreased primarily due to a nonrecurring sale of equipment in 2009 totaling $0.9 million. INTEREST EXPENSE Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 3,813 $ 7,706 $ 10,945 $ (3,893 ) $ (3,239 ) (51 )% (30 )% Interest expense decreased in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2009 primarily due to a lower aggregate principal balance of our 3.50 % convertible notes as a result of our repurchases totaling $151.7 million in aggregate principal amount during 2010. There were no further purchases in 2011. INCOME TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT) Dollars in thousands Dollar Percentage Year ended December 31, change from change from 2011 2010 2009 2010 2009 2010 2009 Income tax provision (benefit) $ 1,405 $ 2,170 $ (158 ) $ (765 ) $ 2,328 (35 )% (1,473 )% The income tax provision was approximately $1.4 million and $2.2 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, which consisted primarily of foreign taxes. The income tax benefit in 2009 of $0.2 million consisted of foreign taxes similar to 2011 and 2010 offset by refundable U.S. credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized if realization of such assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2011, we provided for a valuation allowance of $154.1 million against our net deferred tax assets. As a result of negative evidence based on our cumulative net loss position, we have placed a full valuation allowance on U.S. and certain foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to assure realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income. As of December 31, 2011, we had total net operating loss carryforwards of $288.6 million, comprised of $162.0 million for U.S. federal purposes, which expire in the years 2021 through 2031 if not utilized, and $126.6 million for state purposes, the majority of which expire in the years 2012 through 2031 if not utilized. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. During 2011, due to potential future transactions that would require cash outflows, we changed our assertion such that foreign earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested. As a result, we recorded a net deferred tax liability of approximately $0.8 million related to the foreign undistributed earnings, which was offset by a reduction in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. 37 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through product sales; sales of equity and debt securities such as our 3.50% convertible notes in 2007, collaborative agreements; interest income; licensing of our technology; and, when necessary, financing arrangements with third party creditors. Our cash outflows have generally been as follows: cash used in operating activities such as research and development programs, sales and marketing activity, compensation and benefits of our employees and other working capital needs; cash paid for acquisitions; cash paid for litigation activity and settlements; and cash used for our debt repurchases and repurchases of our convertible notes as well as interest payments on our convertible notes obligations. As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities of approximately $265.1 million. We anticipate that our existing capital resources along with the cash to be generated from operations will enable us to maintain currently planned operations, debt repayments or repurchases, and capital expenditures, for the foreseeable future. These expectations are based on our current operating and financing plans, which are subject to change, and therefore we could require further funding. Factors that may cause us to require additional funding may include, but are not limited to: financing arrangements that we may enter into in connection with our acquisition of eBioscience or future acquisitions; a decline in cash generated by sales of our products and services; our ability to maintain existing collaborative and customer arrangements and establish and maintain new collaboration and customer arrangements; the progress of our research and development programs; initiation or expansion of research programs and collaborations; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights; the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements; the purchase of patent licenses; and other factors. On November 29, 2011, we entered into a Merger Agreement to acquire eBioscience for approximately $330 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Merger Agreement. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including our receipt of financing for the merger. In connection with the Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter with financing sources providing for $190 million of senior secured credit. The conditions to funding these facilities have not been satisfied, and as a result, we will not be able to complete the eBioscience acquisition unless the terms of the acquisition and the financing are restructured. We are in discussions with financing sources and with eBioscience regarding the possibility of restructuring the committed financing but no agreement or understandings have been reached. We have waived eBioscience’s obligations under the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement and we understand that eBioscience is considering alternatives to the merger. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing of the merger has not occurred by March 31, 2012, so long as a breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate has not been the proximate cause of or resulted in the failure of the merger to occur on or before such date. On December 29, 2011, we received notice that Tang Capital Partners, LP, a holder of our 3.50% Senior Convertible Notes Due 2038 (the "Notes"), had commenced class action litigation against us in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint alleged a variety of claims relating to our proposed acquisition of eBioscience, including that the acquisition would constitute a Fundamental Change under the indenture governing the Notes. The complaint sought unspecified damages, temporary and permanent injunctive relief against completion of the eBioscience acquisition, and other remedies. On January 21, 2012, we entered into an agreement to settle the purported class action litigation. As part of the settlement, we agreed to commence a tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes at par plus accrued interest. Tang Capital Partners, LP, which owned approximately $78.3 million principal amount of the Notes, agreed to tender all of its Notes into the offer. 38 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital. To the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements; we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development of our technologies. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms. Our inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange convertible securities or common stock in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions dependent on market conditions, liquidity, and contractual obligations and other factors. We did not retire, repurchase or exchange any of our common stock or remaining outstanding convertible securities during the year ended December 31, 2011. As noted above, on February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes, to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20. Subsequent Events” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Adjustments for non-cash expenses include depreciation and amortization expense of $32.3 million, a net realized loss on investments of $4.8 million, which included other-than-temporary impairment charges totaling $2.1 million, a provision against a notes receivable from a private biotechnology company of $2.2 million, an impairment charge on property and equipment of $1.7 million and share-based compensation expense of $8.8 million. Investing Activities We liquidated a number of investments during the fourth quarter of 2011 to fund the anticipated eBioscience acquisition that resulted in a net inflow from investing activities from the purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities totaling $136.2 million during 2011. Our investing activities further included capital expenditures of $5.8 million and purchased technology rights of $3.2 million in 2011. Financing Activities Our financing activities generally consist of stock option exercise activity under our employee stock plan. Cash used in the issuance of stock under our employee stock plan, net of treasury shares withheld for taxes, was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 39 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2011, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. The impact that our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows (in thousands): Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 After 2016 Senior convertible notes (1) $ 95,469 $ 95,469 $ - $ - $ - Interest payments (1) 557 557 - - - Operating leases 65,420 8,315 14,621 10,622 31,862 Purchase commitments (2) 3,153 3,153 - - - Total contractual obligations $ 164,599 $ 107,494 $ 14,621 $ 10,622 $ 31,862 (1) Our 3.50% senior convertible notes are due in 2038. However, holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2013, 2018 and 2028. On February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the entire aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20. Subsequent Events” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (2) Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Affymetrix and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $16.5 million, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Income Taxes” for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of Affymetrix. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below. Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S. Government and its agencies and high-quality corporate issuers, and, by policy, restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits. To minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates, we maintain investments at an average maturity of less than three years. 40 Table of Contents Periods of Maturity Fair Value at 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total December 31, 2011 ASSETS: Available-for-sale securities $ 7,821 $ 25,616 $ 18,179 $ 10,248 $ 61,864 $ 62,438 Average interest rate 1.2 % 3.0 % 3.5 % 3.5 % LIABILITIES: 3.50% senior convertible notes due 2038 (1) $ - $ 95,469 $ - $ - $ 95,469 $ 95,469 Average interest rate 3.50 % (1) In 2013, the security holders of our 3.50% senior convertible notes have the option to require us to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. On February 3, 2012, we commenced a cash tender offer to repurchase the remaining aggregate outstanding principal amount of our Notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest from the last interest payment date applicable to the Notes to, but not including, the settlement date for the tender offer. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 20. Subsequent Events” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar or foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain or loss after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income, net, immediately. The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our unsettled foreign currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2011. We had no unsettled hedging contracts at December 31, 2010. All contracts have maturities of 12 months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at December 31, 2011 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands): Weighted- Average Notional Settlement Fair Amount Price Value Currency Euro 11,850 1.39 816 Japanese Yen 7,007 79.62 (216 ) British Pound 4,459 1.59 123 Total 23,316 723 41 Table of Contents ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis is intended to assist readers in understanding our results of operations and changes in financial position for the past three years. This review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 83 of this report and the supplemental financial data contained in Tables 1 through 22 included with this discussion and analysis. Overview - 2011 Compared to 2010 Net income for 2011 increased by 27.3% over 2010. Earnings for 2011 were impacted by a bargain purchase gain and accelerated accretion on our preferred stock discount (see discussion below). Financial Highlights ($ in thousands except per share data) 2011 2010 Change Earnings Net interest income $ 132,203 127,354 3.8 % Provision for loan losses – non-covered 28,525 33,646 -15.2 % Provision for loan losses - covered 12,776 20,916 -38.9 % Noninterest income 26,216 29,106 -9.9 % Noninterest expenses 96,106 86,956 10.5 % Income before income taxes 21,012 14,942 40.6 % Income tax expense 7,370 4,960 48.6 % Net income 13,642 9,982 36.7 % Preferred stock dividends (3,234 ) (3,250 ) Accretion of preferred stock discount (2,932 ) (857 ) Net income available to common shareholders $ 7,476 5,875 27.3 % Net income per common share Basic $ 0.44 0.35 25.7 % Diluted 0.44 0.35 25.7 % At Year End Assets $ 3,290,474 3,278,932 0.4 % Loans 2,430,386 2,454,132 -1.0 % Deposits 2,755,037 2,652,513 3.9 % Ratios Return on average assets 0.23 % 0.18 % Return on average common equity 2.59 % 2.05 % Net interest margin (taxable-equivalent) 4.72 % 4.39 % The following is a more detailed discussion of our results for 2011 compared to 2010: For the year ended December 31, 2011, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $7.5 million compared to $5.9 million reported for 2010. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.44 for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $0.35 for 2010. In the first quarter of 2011, we realized a $10.2 million bargain purchase gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank, which is recorded in noninterest income. The after-tax impact of this gain on net income was $6.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share. In the third quarter of 2011, we recorded $2.3 million of accelerated accretion of the discount remaining on the preferred stock that was redeemed during the quarter. This stock was originally issued to the U.S. Treasury in January 2009 as part of the program known as TARP. When this preferred stock was redeemed, the remaining discount that was recorded upon the issuance of the stock, which had been on a five year accretion schedule, was immediately accreted as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders. Total discount accretion of the preferred stock for 2011 was $2.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted common share. 28 Table of Contents In both 2011 and 2010, we experienced significant write-downs and losses associated with loans and foreclosed properties that were assumed in two failed bank acquisitions. The amounts of the write-downs and losses were less in 2011 than in 2010, but continued to significantly impact our earnings. We note that our results of operation are significantly affected by the on-going accounting for the two FDIC-assisted failed bank acquisitions that we have completed. In the discussion below, the term “covered” is used to describe assets included as part of FDIC loss share agreements, which generally result in the FDIC reimbursing the Company for 80% of losses incurred. For covered loans that deteriorate in terms of repayment expectations, we record immediate allowances through the provision of loan losses. For covered loans that experience favorable changes in credit quality compared to what was expected at the acquisition date, including loans that payoff, we record positive adjustments to interest income over the life of the respective loan – also referred to as loan discount accretion. For foreclosed properties that are sold at gains or losses or that are written down to lower values, we record gains/losses within noninterest income. The adjustments discussed above are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations. The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income. The adjustments noted above can result in volatility within individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset, pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses on covered loans, discount accretion, and losses from covered foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset. Total assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $3.3 billion, a 0.4% increase from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2011 amounted to $2.4 billion, a 1.0% decrease from a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2011, a 3.9% increase from a year earlier. Since the onset of the recession, we have generally experienced declines in loans and deposits. Normal loan paydowns, loan charge-offs, and loan foreclosures have exceeded new loan growth, which has provided the liquidity to lessen our reliance on high cost deposits. However, for the last half of 2011, we experienced modest growth in our non-covered loan portfolio, which increased $28 million from June 30, 2011 through year end. We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve our asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our preferred stock, as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Brokered deposits remained at a low level at December 31, 2011, comprising just 5.7% of total deposits, with internet deposits comprising an additional 1.1%. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $132.2 million, an increase of $4.8 million, or 3.8%, from 2010. The higher net interest income was primarily caused by an increase in 2011 in the amount of discount accretion on loans purchased in failed bank acquisitions. Loan discount accretion amounted to $11.6 million for 2011 compared to $7.6 million in 2010, an increase of $4 million. As previously discussed, the impact of changes in discount accretion on pretax income is only 20% of the gross amount of the change. See “Net Interest Income” below for additional information. 29 Table of Contents Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets) for 2011 was 4.72% compared to 4.39% for 2010. The higher margin was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in loan discount accretion, as well as a decline in funding costs. Our provisions for loan losses remain elevated compared to historical levels, primarily due to continued high unemployment rates and ongoing declines in property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. Our provision for loan losses for non-covered loans amounted to $28.5 million for 2011 compared to $33.6 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans. We recorded $12.8 million in provision for loan losses on covered loans during 2011 compared to $20.9 million recorded in 2010. The lower provision in 2011 was due to declines in covered nonperforming loans resulting from the resolution of a significant amount of these loans through a combination of charge-offs and foreclosures. Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010. Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $141 million compared to $168 million at December 31, 2010. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $26.2 million compared to $29.1 million for 2010. The decline in noninterest income in 2011 is primarily due to lower amounts of indemnification asset income recorded. As previously discussed, when we anticipate receiving additional amounts from the FDIC because of new losses identified in our covered loan and foreclosed property portfolios, we record indemnification asset income for 80% of the expected loss. In 2011, fewer new losses were identified compared to 2010, and thus less indemnification asset income was recorded. Noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to $96.1 million, a 10.5% increase from the $87.0 million recorded in 2010. The majority of the increase relates to personnel expense, which increased partially due to employees joining the Company in the 2011 Bank of Asheville acquisition. We also experienced higher employee medical expense due to higher claims in 2011 compared to 2010. We have also progressively built our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities and the overall growth of the Company, and to prepare for future growth, which has generally resulted in higher expenses across all categories. Our effective tax rates were 35.1% and 33.2% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Overview – 2010 Compared to 2009 Net income was significantly lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily due to a gain that resulted from the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June 2009. Most items of income and expense were higher in 2010 than in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, which impacted the Company for twelve months in 2010 compared to six months in 2009 beginning with the June acquisition date. In 2010, our provision for loan losses increased significantly due to deterioration of asset quality, which we believe was primarily caused by the recessionary economic environment, including its unfavorable effect on real estate values.

Earnings per diluted common share were $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $3.37 for 2009. In the second quarter of 2009, we realized a $67.9 million gain related to the acquisition of a failed bank. The after-tax impact of this gain was $41.1 million, or $2.46 per diluted common share. Earnings reported for 2010 were impacted by write-downs of foreclosed properties that were assumed in our 2009 failed bank acquisition and also by higher provisions for loan losses related both to loans acquired in the failed bank acquisition and to our legacy loans (loans not obtained in the failed bank acquisition). Total assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $3.3 billion, a 7.5% decrease from a year earlier. Total loans at December 31, 2010 amounted to $2.5 billion, a 7.5% decrease from a year earlier, and total deposits amounted to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2010, a 9.6% decrease from a year earlier. The contraction of our balance sheet was primarily a result of weak loan demand during 2010, which allowed us to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding. 31 Table of Contents We began experiencing a general decline in loans beginning in 2009 as the full effect of the recession took hold. Loans declined approximately $199 million, or 7.5%, in 2010. Our deposits declined $281 million, or 9.6%, in 2010. The decrease was primarily associated with time deposits, which are generally our highest cost source of funds. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $127.4 million, an 18.9% increase from 2009. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to 1) a higher net interest margin, and 2) the higher average balances of loans and deposits realized from the June 2009 Cooperative Bank acquisition. Our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earnings assets) for 2010 was 4.39% compared to 3.81% for 2009. During 2010, there were no changes in the interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, and we were able to continue to lower rates on our deposits, especially on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher interest rates. Also positively impacting net interest income were purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to our failed bank acquisition in 2009, including adjustments to loan interest income previously discussed. See “Net Interest Income” below for additional discussion. The economic environment, including its unfavorable effect on real estate values, resulted in an increase in our loan losses and nonperforming assets, which led to significantly higher provisions for loan losses in 2010. Our provision for loan losses amounted to $54.6 million for 2010 compared to $20.2 million recorded in 2009. In 2010, our provision for loan losses was comprised of $33.6 million in provisions related to non-covered loans and $20.9 million related to covered loans, whereas in prior years the provision only related to non-covered loans. We recorded $33.6 million and $20.2 million in provision for loan losses during 2010 and 2009, respectively, for non-covered loans. The higher provisions for loan losses were necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans. We recorded $20.9 million in provision for loan losses during 2010 related to covered loans that experienced credit quality deterioration. The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent loans for which we received updated appraisals during 2010 that reflected lower valuations. Net loan charge-offs for 2010 were $42.5 million compared to $12.1 million in 2009. Net charge-offs increased primarily as a result of declines in real estate values. In 2010, net charge-offs were also impacted by charge-offs of covered loans and the recording of partial charge-offs of non-covered loans, neither of which occurred during 2009. We recorded approximately $9.8 million in charge-offs of covered loans in 2010 compared to none in 2009. Also, we recorded partial charge-offs of non-covered loans amounting to $8.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2010. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses, but did not record the charge-offs until the loans were foreclosed upon. Our non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $117 million compared to $92 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.16% compared to 3.10% at December 31, 2009. 32 Table of Contents Our covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2010 amounted to $168 million compared to $165 million at December 31, 2009. Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $29.1 million compared to $89.5 million for 2009. In 2009, we recorded a $67.9 million bargain purchase gain in connection with the acquisition of a failed bank. In 2010, we recorded $35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed property, the majority of which related to the market deterioration of foreclosed properties associated with the failed bank acquisition. We recorded $41.8 million in indemnification asset income related to higher than anticipated claims that we will be able to make with the FDIC under the loss share agreements, primarily relating to loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs. Noninterest expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to $87.0 million, a 10.7% increase from the $78.6 million recorded in 2009. Incremental operating expenses associated with the failed bank acquisition were the primary reason for the increases in 2010. Included in other operating expenses for 2010 were approximately $2.6 million in costs (net of FDIC reimbursements) associated with collection activities on loans and foreclosed properties covered by FDIC loss share agreements, compared to $0.8 million in 2009. Our effective tax rates were 33.2% and 38.4% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2010 was primarily due to increased investment holdings of tax-exempt municipal securities. Outlook for 2012 We expect the banking industry, particularly in our region, to continue to face significant challenges in 2012. While there has been some favorable national economic data reported in recent months, we have seen little, if any, improvement in the unfavorable economic statistics affecting our region. These include unemployment rates, housing starts, home prices, and the number of personal and business bankruptcies. We believe that the Carolinas and Virginia may have been relatively late to experience the downturn in the national economy and that this region is lagging the rest of the country in recovery. Thus, we believe that our loan losses will continue to remain at elevated levels compared to historical norms. We also expect that the weak economy will continue to result in low loan demand. We believe that regulatory reform will negatively impact our earnings. The regulatory climate is not favorable for banks. We expect additional overhead costs will be necessary to comply with all of the new regulations expected to arise directly or indirectly from the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2009 and 2011 we acquired failed banks with approximately $959 and $193 million in assets, respectively. These acquisitions resulted in significant volatility to our earnings in 2009, 2010, and 2011, primarily as a result of the bargain purchase gains recorded on the acquisition dates that increased earnings and write-downs of foreclosed properties in 2010 and 2011 that negatively impacted earnings. While we expect the acquisitions to eventually be accretive to earnings on a consistent basis, we believe that they may continue to add volatility to our reported earnings in 2012. The volatility may be positive to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans improves, or negative to earnings, which would most likely occur if the credit quality of the acquired loans deteriorates or if the properties we have foreclosed on continue to decline in value. 33 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies The accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and with general practices followed by the banking industry. Certain of these principles involve a significant amount of judgment and may involve the use of estimates based on our best assumptions at the time of the estimation. The allowance for loan losses, intangible assets, and the fair value and discount accretion of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions are three policies we have identified as being more sensitive in terms of judgments and estimates, taking into account their overall potential impact to our consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Loan Losses Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have identified the accounting for the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered adequate to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio. Our determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based primarily on a mathematical model that estimates the appropriate allowance for loan losses. This model has two components. The first component involves the estimation of losses on non-single family home loans or relationships greater than $500,000 that are defined as “impaired loans.” A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The estimated valuation allowance is the difference, if any, between the loan balance outstanding and the value of the impaired loan as determined by either 1) an estimate of the cash flows that we expect to receive from the borrower discounted at the loan’s effective rate, or 2) in the case of a collateral-dependent loan, the fair value of the collateral. The second component of the allowance model is an estimate of losses for impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and all loans not considered to be impaired loans. Impaired single family home loans, impaired loans or relationships less than $500,000, and loans that we have classified as having normal credit risk are segregated by loan type, and estimated loss percentages are assigned to each loan type, based on the historical losses, current economic conditions, and operational conditions specific to each loan type. Loans that we have risk graded as having more than “standard” risk but not considered to be impaired are segregated between those relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000 and those that are less than that amount. For those loan relationships with outstanding balances exceeding $500,000, we review the attributes of each individual loan and assign any necessary loss reserve based on various factors including payment history, borrower strength, collateral value, and guarantor strength. For loan relationships less than $500,000 with more than standard risk but not considered to be impaired, loss percentages are based on a multiple of the estimated loss rate for loans of a similar loan type with normal risk. The multiples assigned vary by type of loan, depending on risk, and we have consulted with an external credit review firm in assigning those multiples. The reserve estimated for impaired loans is then added to the reserve estimated for all other loans. This becomes our “allocated allowance.” In addition to the allocated allowance derived from the model, we also evaluate other data such as the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, net loan growth information, nonperforming asset levels and trends in such data. Based on this additional analysis, we may determine that an additional amount of allowance for loan losses is necessary to reserve for probable losses. This additional amount, if any, is our “unallocated allowance.” The sum of the allocated allowance and the unallocated allowance is compared to the actual allowance for loan losses recorded on our books and any adjustment necessary for the recorded allowance to equal the computed allowance is recorded as a provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is a direct charge to earnings in the period recorded. 34 Table of Contents Loans covered under loss share agreements are recorded at fair value at acquisition date. Therefore, amounts deemed uncollectible at acquisition date become a part of the fair value calculation and are excluded from the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent decreases in the amount expected to be collected result in a provision for loan losses with a corresponding increase in the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in the amount expected to be collected are accreted into income over the life of the loan. Proportional adjustments are also recorded to the FDIC indemnification asset. Although we use the best information available to make evaluations, future material adjustments may be necessary if economic, operational, or other conditions change. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations. For further discussion, see “Nonperforming Assets” and “Summary of Loan Loss Experience” below. Intangible Assets Due to the estimation process and the potential materiality of the amounts involved, we have also identified the accounting for intangible assets as an accounting policy critical to our consolidated financial statements. When we complete an acquisition transaction, the excess of the purchase price over the amount by which the fair market value of assets acquired exceeds the fair market value of liabilities assumed represents an intangible asset. We must then determine the identifiable portions of the intangible asset, with any remaining amount classified as goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are generally amortized over the estimated life of the related asset, whereas goodwill is tested annually for impairment, but not systematically amortized. Assuming no goodwill impairment, it is beneficial to our future earnings to have a lower amount assigned to identifiable intangible assets and higher amount of goodwill as opposed to having a higher amount considered to be identifiable intangible assets and a lower amount classified as goodwill. The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangible, whereas when we acquire an insurance agency, the primary identifiable intangible asset is the value of the acquired customer list. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. We typically engage a third party consultant to assist in each analysis. For the whole bank and bank branch transactions recorded to date, the core deposit intangibles have generally been estimated to have a life ranging from seven to ten years, with an accelerated rate of amortization. For insurance agency acquisitions, the identifiable intangible assets related to the customer lists were determined to have a life of ten to fifteen years, with amortization occurring on a straight-line basis. Subsequent to the initial recording of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, we amortize the identifiable intangible assets over their estimated average lives, as discussed above. In addition, on at least an annual basis, goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their related carrying value, including goodwill (our community banking operation is our only material reporting unit). If the carrying value of a reporting unit were ever to exceed its fair value, we would determine whether the implied fair value of the goodwill, using a discounted cash flow analysis, exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Performing such a discounted cash flow analysis would involve the significant use of estimates and assumptions. 35 Table of Contents At our last goodwill impairment evaluation as of September 30, 2011, we determined the fair value of our community banking operation was approximately $18.50 per common share, or 8% higher, than the $17.08 stated book value of our common stock at the date of valuation. To assist us in computing the fair value of our community banking operation, we engaged a consulting firm who used various valuation techniques as part of their analysis, which resulted in the conclusion of the $18.50 value. We review identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our policy is that an impairment loss is recognized, equal to the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and its fair value, if the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Estimating future cash flows involves the use of multiple estimates and assumptions, such as those listed above. Fair Value and Discount Accretion of Loans Acquired in FDIC-Assisted Transactions We consider the determination of the initial fair value of loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions, the initial fair value of the related FDIC indemnification asset, and the subsequent discount accretion of the purchased loans to involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. We determine fair value accounting estimates of newly assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. However, the amount that we realize on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in our financial statements, based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods. To the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates, the FDIC indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss-sharing support from the FDIC. Because of the inherent credit losses associated with the acquired loans in a failed bank acquisition, the amount that we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the “discount” on the acquired loans. We have applied the cost recovery method of accounting to all purchased impaired loans due to the uncertainty as to the timing of expected cash flows. This will result in the recognition of interest income on these impaired loans only when the cash payments received from the borrower exceed the recorded net book value of the related loans. For nonimpaired purchased loans, we accrete the discount over the lives of the loans in a manner consistent with the guidance for accounting for loan origination fees and costs. Merger and Acquisition Activity In both 2009 and 2011 we completed a FDIC-assisted transaction of a failed bank. There were no significant acquisitions in 2010. The results of each acquired company/branch are included in our financial statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions. In October 2011, we announced that we had entered into a Branch Purchase and Assumption Agreement with Waccamaw Bank, headquartered in Whiteville, North Carolina. The agreement provides for First Bank to acquire eleven branches from Waccamaw Bank, which includes assuming all deposits, selected performing loans, and all premises and equipment. Deposits total approximately $180 million and loans total approximately $98 million. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 36 Table of Contents FDIC Indemnification Asset As previously discussed, on June 19, 2009 and January 21, 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, respectively, in FDIC-assisted transactions. For each transaction, the loans and foreclosed real estate purchased are covered by two loss share agreements with the FDIC, which afford First Bank significant loss protection. Under the Cooperative Bank loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to $303 million, and 95% of losses in excess of that amount. Under The Bank of Asheville loss share agreements, the FDIC will cover 80% of all covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses. For both transactions, the loss share reimbursements are applicable for ten years for single family home loans and five years for all other loans. We have recorded a FDIC indemnification asset related to the two transactions to account for payments that we expect to receive from the FDIC related to the loss share agreements. The carrying value of this receivable at each period end is the sum of: 1) actual claims that have been submitted to the FDIC for reimbursement that have not yet been received and 2) our estimated amount of loan and other real estate losses covered by the agreements multiplied by the FDIC reimbursement percentage. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the FDIC indemnification asset was comprised of the following components: ($ in thousands) 2011 2010 Receivable related to claims submitted, not yet received $ 13,377 30,201 Receivable related to estimated future claims on loans 90,275 86,966 Receivable related to estimated future claims on other real estate owned 18,025 6,552 FDIC indemnification asset $ 121,677 123,719 As of each acquisition date, based on the losses inherent in the covered assets and what we estimated we would receive as payments from the FDIC, we recorded a “FDIC Indemnification Asset.” Since that time, we have recorded adjustments to the indemnification asset as discussed below. The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted upwards in the following circumstances: 1) Deterioration of credit quality of covered loans – As of the acquisition dates, we recorded the loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville on our books at a fair value that was $227.9 million and $51.7 million, respectively, less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers, which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of these portfolios change and better information is obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected. For loans with worse repayment expectations, we record provisions for loan losses with corresponding increases to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded provisions for loan losses on covered loans amounting to $12.8 million and $20.9 million, respectively, which resulted in an adjustment to the FDIC indemnification asset of $10.2 million and $16.7 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009. 2) Write-downs and losses on foreclosed properties – When we foreclose on delinquent borrowers, we initially record the foreclosed property at the lower of book or fair value (based on current appraisals), with any deficiency recorded as a charge-off. Subsequent to the foreclosure, we periodically order updated appraisals and if the appraisal indicates a fair value lower than our carrying value, we must write the property down. Also, periodically we sell foreclosed properties that result in losses. Each of these situations results in the Company recording losses on other real estate owned with a corresponding increase to the FDIC indemnification asset by recording noninterest income in proportion to the reimbursement percentage. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded losses and write downs on covered foreclosed properties amounting to $24.5 million and $34.5 million, respectively, which resulted in upward adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset of $19.6 million and $27.6 million, respectively. There were no such adjustments in 2009. 37 Table of Contents 3) Expenses incurred related to collection activities on covered assets – As a result of our collection efforts, we incur expenses such as legal fees, property taxes and appraisal costs. Many of these expenses are reimbursable by the FDIC. These expenses are recorded as “other” noninterest expenses and a corresponding increase is made to increase the FDIC indemnification asset by reducing the gross collection expenses by the amount expected to be reimbursed by the FDIC for eligible expenses. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred $8.5 million, $5.5 million, and $2.1 million in gross collection expenses related to covered assets, respectively, and reduced that amount by $5.7 million, $2.9 million and $1.3 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively. The FDIC indemnification asset has been adjusted downwards in the following circumstances: 1) Receipt of cash from the FDIC related to claims submitted – On at least a quarterly basis, we submit eligible loss share claims to the FDIC. After reviewing and approving the claims, the FDIC wires us cash, which reduces the amount of the FDIC indemnification asset. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we received $69.3 million, $46.7 million and $40.5 million in FDIC reimbursements, respectively. 2) Accretion of discount on acquired loans – As noted above, we recorded the acquired loans of the two transactions on our books at a fair value that was $280 million (in total) less than the contractual amounts due from the borrowers (the “discount”), which was our estimate of the loan losses inherent in the portfolio. As the credit quality of this portfolio changes and better information is obtained about likely losses, some loans have better repayment expectations than we originally projected and some loans have worse repayment expectations than originally projected (discussed above). For loans with improved repayment expectations, we are systematically reducing the discount over the life of the loan as it repays. For some loans, we have received complete payoffs at the contractual balance and the discount must be reduced to zero. When we reduce/accrete the discount, we do so by recognizing interest income in that same amount. When the expected losses on loans with improved repayment expectations becomes less than the original estimate, our expected reimbursement from the FDIC declines as well. Accordingly, we reduce the FDIC indemnification asset by the corresponding reimbursement percentage. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded discount accretion of $11.6 million, $7.6 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, which resulted in a reduction of FDIC indemnification asset of $9.3 million, $6.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. In summary, circumstances that result in adjustments to the FDIC indemnification asset are recorded within the income statement line items noted without consideration of the FDIC loss share agreements. Because favorable changes in covered assets result in lower expected FDIC claims, and unfavorable changes in covered assets result in higher expected FDIC claims, the FDIC indemnification asset is adjusted to reflect those expectations. The net increase or decrease in the indemnification asset is reflected within noninterest income. The adjustments can result in volatility within individual income statement line items. Because of the FDIC loss share agreements and the associated indemnification asset, pretax income resulting from amounts recorded as provisions for loan losses, interest income, and losses from foreclosed properties is generally only impacted by 20% due to the corresponding adjustments made to the indemnification asset. 38 Table of Contents The following presents a rollforward of the FDIC indemnification asset since the date of the Cooperative Bank acquisition on June 19, 2009.

Other factors that significantly affect operating results are the provision for loan losses, noninterest income such as service fees and noninterest expenses such as salaries, occupancy expense, equipment expense and other overhead costs, as well as the effects of income taxes. Net Interest Income Net interest income on a reported basis amounted to $132.2 million in 2011, $127.4 million in 2010, and $107.1 million in 2009. For internal purposes and in the discussion that follows, we evaluate our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by adding the tax benefit realized from tax-exempt securities to reported interest income. Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis amounted to $133.8 million in 2011, $128.7 million in 2010, and $107.9 million in 2009. Management believes that analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis is useful and appropriate because it allows a comparison of net interest amounts in different periods without taking into account the different mix of taxable versus non-taxable investments that may have existed during those periods. The following is a reconciliation of reported net interest income to tax-equivalent net interest income. Year ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Net interest income, as reported $ 132,203 127,354 107,096 Tax-equivalent adjustment 1,556 1,316 818 Net interest income, tax-equivalent $ 133,759 128,670 107,914 Table 2 analyzes net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. Our net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased by 4.0% in 2011 and 19.2% in 2010. There are two primary factors that cause changes in the amount of net interest income we record - 1) changes in our loans and deposits balances, and 2) our net interest margin (tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets). 39 Table of Contents For 2011, the increase in net interest income over the comparable period in 2010 was due to a higher net interest margin, which was partially offset by a lower level of earning assets due to a contraction of our balance sheet during 2011. In 2010, higher average loan and deposit balances increased net interest income. Also, the positive effects of the increased balances in 2010 were enhanced by a higher net interest margin. Although our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in early 2011 resulted in the addition of $102 million in loans, our average loan balances declined by $92 million during the year - from $2.55 billion in 2010 to $2.46 billion in 2011. We believe the decline in loans is primarily a direct and indirect result of the weak economy in our market area. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million that reduced our loan balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions. Also, loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations. With the decline in loans, we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding, including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits, which resulted in lower deposit balances (and, as discussed below, a lower average cost of funds). Although loans and deposits outstanding decreased during calendar year 2010, the average balances of loans and deposits were both higher in 2010 than they were in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative Bank acquisition that occurred in mid-2009. The loans and deposits acquired in this acquisition impacted loan and deposit balances outstanding for all twelve months of 2010 and for the six month period subsequent to the June 2009 acquisition. As illustrated in Table 3, the lower average loan and deposit balances negatively impacted net interest income in 2011, while higher balances positively impacted net interest income in 2010. In 2011, declines in interest-earning assets, primarily loans, resulted in a decrease in interest income of $4.4 million, while lower amounts of interest-bearing liabilities resulted in only $0.4 million of lower interest expense. As a result, the net impact of lower loans and deposits was a decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income of $4.0 million in 2011. In 2010, growth in interest-earning assets resulted in an increase in interest income of $6.1 million, while higher amounts of interest-bearing liabilities only resulted in $0.5 million in increased interest expense. As a result, the higher average balances of loans and deposits resulted in an increase in tax-equivalent net interest income of $5.6 million in 2010. Table 3 also illustrates the impact that changes in the interest rates that we earned/paid had on our net interest income in 2010 and 2011. In both years, lower interest rates on deposits was the primary factor affecting net interest income. Although the prime rate of interest has not changed since 2008, interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds and other interest-sensitive financial instruments have steadily declined since then, resulting in a generally lower interest rate environment. In both years, the progressively lower interest rate environment gave us the opportunity to reduce rates on matured time deposits, and we were also able to gradually reduce interest rates on demand deposits. In 2010, the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by $17.5 million and in 2011 the lower interest rates reduced interest expense by $7.9 million. The lower interest rate environment had much less impact on our interest income, with the impact of changes in interest rates lowering interest income by $2.3 million in 2010 and increasing it by $1.2 million in 2011. The lesser impact was due to continued use of interest rate floors on loans, as well as the effect of higher levels of loan discount accretion in both 2010 and 2011 (discussed below). Overall, changes in interest rates increased net interest income by $15.2 million in 2010 and $9.1 million in 2011. We measure the spread between the yield on our earning assets and the cost of our funding primarily in terms of the ratio entitled “net interest margin” which is defined as tax-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. Our net interest margin increased 33 basis points in 2011 to 4.72% from 4.39% in 2010. Our net interest margin was 3.81% in 2009. 40 Table of Contents The primary reason for the increases in our net interest margin has been that the yields on interest-earning assets have remained fairly stable over the past three years, ranging from 5.48% to 5.55%, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities has steadily declined from 1.96% in 2009 to 1.20% in 2010 to 0.90% in 2011. As noted above, our interest-earning asset yields have remained stable because of the continued use of interest rate floors on loans, as well as higher levels of loan discount accretion. Also as noted above, we have been able to lower rates on maturing time deposits that were originated in periods of higher rates throughout 2009, 2010, and 2011. And to a lesser degree, we have been able to progressively lower interest rates on various types of savings, NOW and money market accounts. We have also experienced declines in our levels of higher cost deposit balances, including internet deposits and large denomination time deposits. During each of the past three years, our net interest margin also benefitted from the net accretion of purchase accounting premiums/discounts associated with the Cooperative Bank acquisition in June 2009 and, to a lesser degree, the acquisition of Great Pee Dee Bancorp in April 2008 and The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $11.6 million, $10.0 million and $5.6 million, respectively, in net accretion of purchase accounting premiums/discounts that increased net interest income. The following table provides detail of the purchase accounting adjustments that impacted net interest income: ($ in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2011 Year Ended December 31, 2010 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Interest income – reduced by premium amortization on loans $ (453 ) (196 ) (196 ) Interest income – increased by accretion of loan discount 11,598 7,607 1,469 Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of deposits 337 2,211 3,911 Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of borrowings 146 341 464 Impact on net interest income $ 11,628 9,963 5,648 The following table presents the purchase accounting entries that we expect to record in 2012. ($ in thousands) Expected - 2012 Interest income – reduced by premium amortization on loans $ (465 ) Interest income – increased by accretion of loan discount See note below Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of deposits 85 Interest expense – reduced by premium amortization of borrowings 30 Impact on net interest income See note below Note - We cannot determine the amount of interest income, if any, to be recognized from the accretion of the loan discount on Cooperative loans or The Bank of Asheville loans because it is reliant on our ongoing assessment during the year of the repayment period of the loans, which is impacted by any changes in expected credit losses related to the loans. See additional information regarding net interest income in the section entitled “Interest Rate Risk.” Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses charged to operations is an amount sufficient to bring the allowance for loan losses to an estimated balance considered appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. Management’s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the level of loan growth, an evaluation of the portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other risk factors. Our provisions for loan losses and nonperforming assets remain at what we believe to be elevated levels, primarily due to high unemployment rates and declining property values in our market area that negatively impact collateral dependent real estate loans. For 2011, 2010, and 2009 our total provisions for loan losses were $41.3 million, $54.6 million, and $20.2 million, respectively. The total provision for loan losses is comprised of provision for loan losses for non-covered loans and provision for loan losses for covered loans, as discussed in the following paragraphs. 41 Table of Contents We recorded $28.5 million, $33.6 million, and $20.2 million in provisions for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the years-ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The lower provision for loan losses for non-covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to stabilization in overall loan quality and lower levels of non-covered nonperforming loans. The higher provision for non-covered loans in 2010 was necessary primarily as a result of higher levels of classified and nonperforming assets and the impact of declining real estate values on our collateral dependent real estate loans. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $12.8 million and $20.9 million in provisions for loan losses for covered loans, respectively, that experienced credit quality deterioration. The credit quality deterioration primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals in 2011 and 2010 that reflected lower valuations. The lower provision for loan losses for covered loans in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to lower levels of nonperforming covered loans. Because of the FDIC loss-share agreements in place for these loans, the FDIC indemnification asset was adjusted upwards by recording noninterest income of $10.2 million and $16.7 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, or 80% of the amount of the provisions (see discussion above). Total net charge-offs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, were $49.3 million, $42.5 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. As discussed further below, the higher net charge-offs in 2010 and 2011 compared to 2009 were primarily a result of worsening economic conditions, especially related to real estate, that resulted in higher levels of borrowers not repaying their loans. Net-charge offs for non-covered loans were $31.2 million, $32.7 million and $12.1 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009 respectively. Net charge-offs of non-covered loans were impacted by $9.0 million and $8.6 million in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Prior to 2010 we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loan losses, but did not record charge-offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon. Net charge-offs for covered loans were $18.1 million, $9.8 million, and $0 in for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The charge-offs of covered loans were primarily a result of declining collateral values on collateral dependent nonaccrual loans. In 2011 and 2010, our provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs were concentrated in loans classified as “real estate – construction, land development & other land loans.” This category of loans is primarily comprised of land acquisition and development loans and other types of lot loans. These types of loans have been particularly hard hit by the decline in real estate development and property values. As can be seen in Table 10, although we have reduced our exposure to this category of loans, we continue to have exposure to this sector and future significant losses could result. Non-covered nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 amounted to $122 million compared to $117 million and $92 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the ratio of non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets was 4.30% compared to 4.16% and 3.10% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Also see “Nonperforming Assets” below for additional discussion. See the section entitled “Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience” below for a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is monitored and analyzed regularly in conjunction with our loan analysis and grading program, and adjustments are made to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses. 42 Table of Contents Noninterest Income Our noninterest income amounted to $26.2 million in 2011, $29.1 million in 2010, and $89.5 million in 2009. As shown in Table 4, core noninterest income excludes gains from acquisitions, foreclosed property write-downs and losses, indemnification asset income, securities gains or losses, and other miscellaneous gains and losses. Core noninterest income amounted to $23.2 million in 2011, a 4.7% increase from $22.1 million in 2010. The 2010 core noninterest income of $22.1 million was 1.2% higher than the $21.9 million recorded in 2009. See Table 4 and the following discussion for an understanding of the components of noninterest income. Service charges on deposit accounts in 2011 amounted to $12.0 million, a 2.9% decrease compared to $12.3 million recorded in 2010. The $12.3 million recorded in 2010 was 5.9% less than the 2009 amount of $13.1 million. Legislation that became effective on July 1, 2010 reduced our fees earned on overdrafts in 2010 and 2011, which was the primary reason for the declines in this component of noninterest income. Specifically, the legislation now prohibits us from charging an overdraft fee for paying ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to our payment of overdrafts for these transactions. Additional regulations on overdraft fees became effective July 1, 2011 that further reduced our overdraft fees, although to a lesser extent than the 2010 changes. In April 2011, we implemented new fees on deposit accounts, such as fees for customers that elect to receive paper statements, that have helped to replace a large portion of the revenue that was lost as a result of the overdraft legislation. Other service charges, commissions and fees amounted to $8.1 million in 2011, a 24.0% increase from the $6.5 million earned in 2010. The 2010 amount of $6.5 million was a 13.6% increase from the $5.7 million earned in 2009. This category of noninterest income includes items such as electronic payment processing revenue (which includes fees related to credit card transactions by merchants and customers and fees earned from debit card transactions), ATM charges, safety deposit box rentals, fees from sales of personalized checks, and check cashing fees. The growth in this category for both years was primarily attributable to increased debit card usage by our customers, as we earn a small fee each time our customers make a debit card transaction. Also, part of the increase in this category is due to the overall growth in our total customer base, including growth achieved from corporate acquisitions. Fees from presold mortgages amounted to $1.6 million in 2011, $1.8 million in 2010, and $1.5 million in 2009. We continue to experience higher mortgage refinance activity due to lower interest rates. Commissions from sales of insurance and financial products amounted to $1.5 million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009. This line item includes commissions we receive from three sources - 1) sales of credit life insurance associated with new loans, 2) commissions from the sales of investment, annuity, and long-term care insurance products, and 3) commissions from the sale of property and casualty insurance. The following table presents the contribution of each of the three sources to the total amount recognized in this line item: 43 Table of Contents ($ in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Commissions earned from: Sales of credit life insurance $ 70 107 281 Sales of investments, annuities, and long term care insurance 760 531 503 Sales of property and casualty insurance 682 838 740 Total $ 1,512 1,476 1,524 Noninterest income not considered to be “core” resulted in a net contribution to total noninterest income of $3.0 million in 2011, $7.0 million in 2010, and $67.6 million in 2009. The components of non-core noninterest income are shown in Table 4 and the significant components thereof are discussed below. In 2011 and 2010, we recorded $27.8 million and $35.5 million in write-downs and losses on foreclosed properties, respectively, of which $24.5 million and $34.5 million related to write-downs on covered properties, respectively. Consistent with the other failed bank accounting adjustments discussed earlier, the bottom line impact to pretax income of these write-downs on covered properties was 20% of the gross write-downs. Indemnification asset income for 2011 and 2010 amounted to $20.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively (with no corresponding amount in 2009). This income primarily relates to upward adjustments to the amount expected to be received from the FDIC under loss share agreements as a result of higher than anticipated loan losses and foreclosed property losses and write-downs, as follows: ($ in millions) 2011 2010 Higher expected FDIC claims for covered loans experiencing a deterioration in quality $ 12.7 $ 20.9 Lower expected FDIC claims for covered loans related to loan discount accretion and principal paydowns/payoffs (11.6 ) (3.2 ) Foreclosed property losses and write-downs - covered 24.5 34.5 Total adjustment to expected FDIC loss-share claims 25.6 52.2 Expected reimbursement rate 80 % 80 % Indemnification asset income $ 20.5 $ 41.8 In 2011 and 2009, as previously discussed, we realized gains from the FDIC-assisted acquisitions of failed banks amounting to $10.2 million and $67.9 million, respectively, which were the amounts by which the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed in each transaction. The line item “Other gains (losses)” was positively impacted in 2010 by the sale of our merchant credit card processing portfolio, which resulted in a gain of $850,000. Noninterest Expenses Noninterest expenses for 2011 were $96.1 million, compared to $87.0 million in 2010 and $78.6 million in 2009. Table 5 presents the components of our noninterest expense during the past three years. As reflected in the amounts noted above, noninterest expenses increased 10.5% in 2011 and 10.7% in 2010. The increases in noninterest expenses over the past three years have occurred in almost every line item of expense and have been primarily a result of our significant growth. Due to acquisition and internal growth, over the past three years our number of bank branches has increased from 74 to 97, and the number of full time equivalent employees has increased from 650 at December 31, 2008 to 830 at December 31, 2011. Additionally, from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2011, the amount of loans outstanding increased 9.9% and deposits increased 32.8%. 44 Table of Contents Total personnel expense increased by approximately $6.1 million, or 13.6%, in 2011. Salaries expense comprised $4.7 million of this increase, which was primarily a result of an initiative to progressively build our infrastructure to manage increased compliance burdens, collection activities, and overall growth of the Company, as well as to prepare for future growth. Another factor in the increase in salaries expense in 2011 was the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011, which added approximately 35 employees. Higher employee health insurance costs also played a role in the increase in personnel expense in 2011. Employee health insurance expense amounted to $4.4 million in 2011, an increase of $1.3 million over the $3.1 million incurred in 2010. We self-insure our employees’ health care expense; therefore, incurred health care costs directly impact the expense we record. In 2010, salaries expense increased $4.3 million, primarily due to a full year of salaries related to employees assumed in the June 2009 Cooperative acquisition. The increase in salary expense was partially offset by lower health care expenses of $0.4 million and lower pension expense in 2010 of $0.6 million. Pension expense decreased during 2010 primarily due to investment gains experienced by the pension plan’s assets in 2009. In 2011 and 2009, we incurred acquisition expenses of approximately $0.6 million in connection with The Bank of Asheville acquisition and $1.3 million in connection with the Cooperative Bank acquisition, respectively. Acquisition expenses for both periods consisted primarily of professional fees. FDIC deposit insurance expense declined in each of the past two years. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, we incurred approximately $5.5 million, $4.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, in FDIC deposit insurance premium expense. The $5.5 million in FDIC insurance expense for 2009 included a special assessment, which applied to all banks, of $1.6 million. As previously discussed, the FDIC changed its premium assessment methodology in April 2011, which was favorable for our company and reduced our expense in 2011. Due to higher levels of delinquencies and foreclosure activity, including those associated with our covered assets, we recorded $5.5 million in repossession and collection expenses, net of FDIC reimbursements, in 2011, compared to $4.8 million in 2010 and $1.7 million in 2009. Within the “non-credit losses” presented in Table 5, we recorded $1 million in 2011 in connection with a fraud loss. Income Taxes The provision for income taxes was $7.4 million in 2011, $5.0 million in 2010, and $37.6 million in 2009. Table 6 presents the components of tax expense and the related effective tax rates. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 35.1% compared to 33.2% in 2010 and 38.4% in 2009. The variances in effective tax rates are primarily due to changes in the proportion of tax-exempt interest income to pretax income. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 35% in 2012. Stock-Based Compensation We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million, $0.6 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding stock-based compensation. 45 Table of Contents ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION Overview Over the past two years, our total assets have decreased from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009 to $3.3 billion at December 31, 2011, which was primarily due to declines in our outstanding loans and deposits. Changes in our loans and deposit balances occur as a result of organic growth or decline, as well as acquisitions. During the first quarter of 2011, we acquired The Bank of Asheville in a FDIC-assisted failed bank transaction. The following table presents detailed information regarding the nature of changes in our loans and deposits in 2010 and 2011: ($ in thousands) Balance at beginning of period Internal growth (1) Growth from Acquisitions Balance at end of period Total percentage growth Internal percentage growth (1) 2011 Loans – Non-covered $ 2,083,004 (13,852 ) — 2,069,152 -0.7 % -0.7 % Loans – Covered 371,128 (112,162 ) 102,268 361,234 -2.7 % -30.2 % Total loans $ 2,454,132 (126,014 ) 102,268 2,430,386 -1.0 % -5.1 % Deposits – Noninterest bearing $ 292,759 24,276 18,798 335,833 14.7 % 8.3 % Deposits – NOW 292,623 99,471 31,358 423,452 44.7 % 34.0 % Deposits – Money market 498,312 (7,661 ) 19,150 509,801 2.3 % -1.5 % Deposits – Savings 153,325 (10,056 ) 3,212 146,481 -4.5 % -6.6 % Deposits – Brokered time 143,554 (1,048 ) 14,902 157,408 9.7 % -0.7 % Deposits – Internet time 46,801 (59,819 ) 42,920 29,902 -36.1 % -127.8 % Deposits – Time >$100,000 - retail 602,371 (40,478 ) 13,515 575,408 -4.5 % -6.7 % Deposits – Time <$100,000 - retail 622,768 (94,905 ) 48,889 576,752 -7.4 % -15.2 % Total deposits $ 2,652,513 (90,220 ) 192,744 2,755,037 3.9 % -3.4 % 2010 Loans – Non-covered $ 2,132,843 (49,839 ) — 2,083,004 -2.3 % -2.3 % Loans – Covered 520,022 (148,894 ) — 371,128 -28.6 % -28.6 % Total loans $ 2,652,865 (198,733 ) — 2,454,132 -7.5 % -7.5 % Deposits – Noninterest bearing $ 272,422 20,337 — 292,759 7.5 % 7.5 % Deposits – NOW 362,366 (69,743 ) — 292,623 -19.2 % -19.2 % Deposits – Money market 496,940 1,372 — 498,312 0.3 % 0.3 % Deposits – Savings 149,338 3,987 — 153,325 2.7 % 2.7 % Deposits – Brokered time 76,332 67,222 — 143,554 88.1 % 88.1 % Deposits – Internet time 128,024 (81,223 ) — 46,801 -63.4 % -63.4 % Deposits – Time >$100,000 - retail 704,128 (101,757 ) — 602,371 -14.5 % -14.5 % Deposits – Time <$100,000 - retail 743,558 (120,790 ) — 622,768 -16.2 % -16.2 % Total deposits $ 2,933,108 (280,595 ) — 2,652,513 -9.6 % -9.6 % (1) Excludes the impact of acquisitions in the year of the acquisition, but includes growth or declines in acquired operations after the date of acquisition. In 2011, as derived from the table above, our total loans declined $24 million, or 1.0%. Positively impacting loans outstanding was our acquisition of The Bank of Asheville on January 21, 2011, which added $102 million in loans. However, this increase was more than offset by loan payoffs, foreclosures and loan charge-offs. During 2011, we charged-off $52 million in loans and foreclosed on another $76 million that reduced our loan balances, with a portion of the charge-off and foreclosure activity relating to our two FDIC failed bank acquisitions. Also, loan demand in most of our market areas has remained weak, with the pace of loan principal repayments substantially offsetting new loan originations. In addition, we have de-emphasized certain types of lending, most notably acquisition and development land loans and non-owner occupied commercial real estate. 46 Table of Contents However, for the first time since our loans outstanding began trending downward in 2008, we experienced sequential quarterly growth in our non-covered loan portfolio during each of the last two quarters of 2011, with non-covered loans increasing by $28 million during the last half of 2011. We are actively pursuing lending opportunities in order to improve asset yields, as well as to potentially decrease the dividend rate on our SBLF preferred stock (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for more information). To start 2011, our total deposits increased by $193 million as a result of the January acquisition of The Bank of Asheville. For the remainder of the year, as our loans declined, we were able to lessen our reliance on higher cost sources of funding, including internet deposits and time deposits, which resulted in generally declining deposit balances. Our lowest cost deposits, noninterest bearing demand accounts and NOW accounts, experienced positive internal growth of $24 million and $99 million, respectively. In addition to our bank-wide emphasis to grow these types of low-rate accounts, the increase in NOW accounts was impacted by $38 million in customer funds that were shifted from repurchase agreements (securities sold under agreements to repurchase) to NOW accounts during late 2011. In July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act repealed certain sections of the Federal Reserve Act that prohibited payment of interest on commercial demand deposits. With this prohibition removed, we began to pay interest on certain types of commercial demand accounts, and we encouraged our customers with repurchase agreements to switch to commercial NOW accounts, which eliminated the need to sell/pledge our investment securities. For the same reasons as discussed above for 2011, we experienced a decline in loans of 7.5% in 2010. In 2010, we also experienced a decline in deposits of 9.6%, with most of the decline occurring in retail time deposits. Retail time deposits are generally a high cost source of funds for us, and during 2010 we decided not to match promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources, and consequently we experienced a loss of time deposits. Also declining significantly in 2010 was our level of internet time deposits. Our level of time deposits gathered from internet posting services declined from $128 million at December 31, 2009 to $47 million at December 31, 2010. Substantially all of our internet deposits during 2010 were assumed in the Cooperative acquisition in 2009. Prior to its closing, Cooperative was prohibited from originating or renewing brokered deposits and accordingly, they enhanced liquidity by offering relatively high interest rates on internet posting services. As these time deposits have matured, the internet depositors, mostly credit unions, have elected not to renew the time deposits at the interest rates we have proposed. In 2010, we replaced most of the lost internet deposits with brokered deposits, which had more favorable interest rates. As a result, our brokered deposits increased from $76 million at December 31, 2009 to $144 million at December 31, 2010. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds in the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program. This program previously provided unlimited FDIC insurance for interest bearing transaction accounts earning interest rates up to 0.25%. Subsequent to this change, the only accounts with unlimited FDIC insurance are non-interest bearing transaction accounts. Our overall liquidity increased slightly during 2011 compared to 2010. We experienced a $103 million increase in deposits, while loans decreased $24 million. With the excess deposits, we were able to reduce our borrowings by approximately $63 million during 2011. Our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to 15.7% at December 31, 2011. Our capital ratios improved in 2011. All of our capital ratios have continually exceeded the regulatory thresholds for “well-capitalized” status for all periods covered by this report. 47 Table of Contents Due to the continued economic slowdown, our asset quality ratios remain at unfavorable levels compared to most of our company’s history. Our non-covered nonperforming assets to total non-covered assets ratio was 4.30% at December 31, 2011 compared to 4.16% at December 31, 2010, and 3.10% at December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our ratio of net non-covered charge-offs to average non-covered loans was 1.52% compared to 1.55% for 2010, and 0.56% for 2009. Distribution of Assets and Liabilities Table 7 sets forth the percentage relationships of significant components of our balance sheet at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Our balance sheet distribution has remained relatively stable over the past three years. The increase in NOW deposits discussed earlier resulted in an increase in this category from 9% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2010 to 13% in 2011. Also, over the past two years we have experienced a decline in retail time deposits less than $100,000 (“other time deposits”) that has resulted in other time deposits declining from 23% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity in 2009 to 18% in 2011. Securities Information regarding our securities portfolio as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is presented in Tables 8 and 9. The composition of the investment securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income. The investment portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds, furnishing liquidity, and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits. We obtain fair values for the vast majority of our investment securities from a third-party investment recordkeeper, who specializes in securities purchases and sales, recordkeeping, and valuation. This recordkeeper provides us with a third-party report that contains an evaluation of internal controls that includes testwork of securities valuation. We further test the values we receive by comparing the values for a significant sample of securities to another third-party valuation service on a quarterly basis. Total securities amounted to $240.6 million, $235.2 million, and $214.2 million, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The majority of our “government-sponsored enterprise” securities are issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank and carry one maturity date, often with an issuer call feature. At December 31, 2011, of the $35 million (carrying value) in government-sponsored enterprise securities, $21 million were issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank system and the remaining $14 million were issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank system. Our $124 million of mortgage-backed securities have all been issued by either Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, or the Small Business Administration, each of which are government-sponsored corporations. We have no “private label” mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities vary in their repayment in correlation with the underlying pools of mortgage loans. Included in mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2011 were collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) with an amortized cost of $1.5 million and a fair value of $1.5 million. The CMOs that we have invested in are substantially all “early tranche” portions of the CMOs, which minimizes our long-term interest rate risk. 48 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, our $12.5 million investment in corporate bonds was comprised of the following: ($in thousands) S&P Issuer Maturity Amortized Market Issuer Ratings (1) Date Cost Value First Citizens Bancorp (South Carolina) Bond Not Rated 4/1/15 $ 2,996 3,102 Bank of America Trust Preferred Security BB 12/11/26 2,039 1,780 Bank of America Trust Preferred Security BB 4/15/27 5,046 4,588 First Citizens Bancorp (North Carolina) Trust Preferred Security BB 3/1/28 2,108 2,278 First Citizens Bancorp (South Carolina) Trust Preferred Security Not Rated 6/15/34 1,000 740 Total investment in corporate bonds $ 13,189 12,488 (1) The ratings are as of January 26, 2012. Substantially all of our investment in equity securities at each year end was comprised of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB). The FHLB requires us to purchase their stock in order to borrow from them. The amount they require us to invest is based on our level of borrowings from them. At December 31, 2011, our investment in capital stock of the FHLB amounted to $10.9 million of our total investment in equity securities of $11.4 million. Until February 27, 2009, the FHLB redeemed their stock at par as borrowings were repaid. On February 27, 2009, the FHLB announced that they would no longer automatically redeem their stock when loans are repaid. Instead, they stated that they would evaluate whether they would repurchase stock on a quarterly basis. During 2010 and 2011, the FHLB repurchased $1.8 million and $3.9 million, respectively, of their stock from the Company. The fair value of securities held to maturity, which we carry at amortized cost, was $4,766,000 more than the carrying value at December 31, 2011 and $706,000 less than the carrying value at December 31, 2010. Our $58.0 million in securities held to maturity are comprised almost entirely of municipal bonds issued by state and local governments throughout our market area. We have only two municipal bonds with a denomination greater than $2,000,000 and we have no significant concentration of bond holdings from one government entity, with the single largest exposure to any one entity being $3,700,000. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, a net unrealized gain of $3,896,000, $2,478,000, and $1,832,000, respectively, was included in the carrying value of securities classified as available for sale. During the past three years, interest rates have generally declined, which typically increases the value of our investment securities. Management evaluated any unrealized losses on individual securities at each year end and determined them to be of a temporary nature and caused by fluctuations in market interest rates and the overall economic environment, not by concerns about the ability of the issuers to meet their obligations. Net unrealized gains, net of applicable deferred income taxes, of $2,376,000, $1,512,000, and $1,117,000 have been reported as part of a separate component of shareholders’ equity (accumulated other comprehensive income) as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities available for sale portfolio was 3.01% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the available for sale portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds, the maturity date for all other non-mortgage-backed securities, and the expected life for mortgage-backed securities, was 5.2 years. The weighted average taxable-equivalent yield for the securities held to maturity portfolio was 5.78% at December 31, 2011. The expected weighted average life of the held to maturity portfolio using the call date for above-market callable bonds and the maturity date for all other securities, was 6.6 years. 49 Table of Contents The following table provides the names of issuers for which the Company has investment securities totaling in excess of 10% of shareholders’ equity and the fair value and amortized cost of these investments as of December 31, 2011. All of these securities are issued by government sponsored corporations. ($ in thousands) Issuer Amortized Cost Fair Value % of Shareholders’ Equity Ginnie Mae $ 66,888 70,016 20.3 % Small Business Administration 39,034 39,055 11.3 % Total $ 105,922 109,071 Loans Table 10 provides a summary of the loan portfolio composition of our total loans at each of the past five year ends. As previously discussed, in our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, we entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC, which afford us significant protection from losses on all loans and other real estate acquired in those acquisitions. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, the financial risk of the Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville loans is significantly different from assets not covered under the loss share agreements. Accordingly, we present separately loans subject to the FDIC loss share agreements as “covered loans” and loans that are not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered loans.” Table 10a presents a breakout of covered and non-covered loans as of December 31, 2011. The loan portfolio is the largest category of our earning assets and is comprised of commercial loans, real estate mortgage loans, real estate construction loans, and consumer loans. We restrict virtually all of our lending to our 36 county market area, which is located in western, central and eastern North Carolina, four counties in southern Virginia and five counties in northeastern South Carolina. The diversity of the region’s economic base has historically provided a stable lending environment. In 2011, loans outstanding decreased $23.7 million, or 1.0% to $2.43 billion. In 2010, loans outstanding decreased $198.7 million, or 7.5% to $2.45 billion. As previously discussed, the declines for both years were mainly due to loan payoffs and loan foreclosures exceeding new loan growth as loan demand in most of our market areas remained weak. The majority of our loan portfolio over the years has been real estate mortgage loans, with loans secured by real estate consistently comprising 86% to 90% of our outstanding loan balances. Except for real estate construction, land development and other land loans, the majority of our “real estate” loans are personal and commercial loans where cash flow from the borrower’s occupation or business is the primary repayment source, with the real estate pledged providing a secondary repayment source. Table 10 indicates that the two types of loans that have had the largest variances in the amount outstanding as a percent of total loans have been construction/land development loans and residential mortgage loans. In 2005 we expanded our branch network to what was then the fast-growing southeast coast of North Carolina, which had a high demand for construction and land development loans. In 2008, due to recessionary conditions, particularly in the new housing market, loan demand for these types of loans weakened and we tightened our loan underwriting criteria for these types of loans, which reduced growth. Due to economic conditions, for the past three years we have made very few new acquisition and land development loans, and we expect this trend to continue. 50 Table of Contents Our concentration of residential mortgage loans increased in 2009 as a result of the Cooperative acquisition, because Cooperative’s loan portfolio was heavily concentrated in residential mortgages. In 2011, due to The Bank of Asheville acquisition, our percentage of commercial real estate loans increased slightly as that bank’s primary business had been commercial lending. Table 11 provides a summary of scheduled loan maturities over certain time periods, with fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans shown separately. Approximately 23% of our accruing loans outstanding at December 31, 2011 mature within one year and 67% of total loans mature within five years. As of December 31, 2011, the percentages of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans as compared to total performing loans were 47% and 53%, respectively. We intentionally make a blend of fixed and variable rate loans so as to reduce interest rate risk. Nonperforming Assets Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, loans past due 90 or more days and still accruing interest, and other real estate. As a matter of policy we place all loans that are past due 90 or more days on nonaccrual basis, and thus there were no loans at any of the past five year ends that were 90 days past due and still accruing interest. Nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest income is no longer being recognized or accrued because management has determined that the collection of interest is doubtful. Placing loans on nonaccrual status negatively impacts earnings because (i) interest accrued but unpaid as of the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and deducted from interest income, (ii) future accruals of interest income are not recognized until it becomes probable that both principal and interest will be paid and (iii) principal charged-off, if appropriate, may necessitate additional provisions for loan losses that are charged against earnings. In some cases, where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties, loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the originally contracted terms. Table 12 summarizes our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. Because of the loss protection provided by the FDIC, we present separately nonperforming assets subject to the loss share agreements as “covered” and nonperforming assets that are not subject to the loss share agreements as “non-covered.” Due largely to the economic downturn that began in late 2007 and continued to worsen over the past few years, we have experienced increases in our non-covered nonperforming assets. Our total nonperforming assets were also significantly impacted by the Cooperative acquisition in 2009. Table 12a presents our nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 by general geographic region and further segregated into “covered” nonperforming assets and “non-covered” nonperforming assets. The majority of our nonperforming assets are located in the Eastern North Carolina region, which has experienced the most negative effects of the recession of any of our regions. Non-covered nonperforming loans totaled $85.2 million, $96.0 million, and $83.5 million, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Total non-covered nonperforming loans as a percentage of total non-covered loans amounted to 4.12%, 4.61%, and 3.91%, at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, non-covered troubled debt restructurings amounted to $11.7 million, $33.7 million, and $21.3 million, respectively. The decline in 2011 is primarily a result of troubled debt restructurings that re-defaulted and were placed on nonaccrual status. The increase in 2010 was the result of our initiative to work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by modifying certain loan terms. 51 Table of Contents We also had $14.2 million and $14.4 million of covered troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to none in 2009. The following is the composition, by loan type, of all of our nonaccrual loans at each period end, as classified for regulatory purposes: ($ in thousands) At December 31, 2011 (1) At December 31, 2010 (1) Commercial, financial, and agricultural $ 3,300 2,595 Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans 48,467 54,781 Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages 24,133 36,715 Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit 7,255 8,584 Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other 28,491 17,578 Installment loans to individuals 3,392 539 Total nonaccrual loans $ 115,038 120,792 (1) Includes both covered and non-covered loans. The following segregates our nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2011 into covered and non-covered loans, as classified for regulatory purposes: ($ in thousands) Covered Nonaccrual Loans Non-covered Nonaccrual Loans Total Nonaccrual Loans Commercial, financial, and agricultural $ 469 2,831 3,300 Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans 21,203 27,264 48,467 Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages 10,134 13,999 24,133 Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit 1,231 6,024 7,255 Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other 8,212 20,279 28,491 Installment loans to individuals 223 3,169 3,392 Total nonaccrual loans $ 41,472 73,566 115,038 The following segregates our nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 into covered and non-covered loans, as classified for regulatory purposes: ($ in thousands) Covered Nonaccrual Loans Non-covered Nonaccrual Loans Total Nonaccrual Loans Commercial, financial, and agricultural $ 163 2,432 2,595 Real estate – construction, land development, and other land loans 30,846 23,935 54,781 Real estate – mortgage – residential (1-4 family) first mortgages 16,343 20,372 36,715 Real estate – mortgage – home equity loans/lines of credit 4,059 4,525 8,584 Real estate – mortgage – commercial and other 7,039 10,539 17,578 Installment loans to individuals 16 523 539 Total nonaccrual loans $ 58,466 62,326 120,792 The tables above indicate that covered nonaccrual loans declined from $58.5 million at December 31, 2010 to $41.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease was primarily a result of many of the nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010 being either charged-off or being foreclosed upon in 2011 and their balances being transferred to other real estate during the year. Non-covered nonaccrual loans increased from $62.3 million at December 31, 2010 to $73.6 million at December 31, 2011, which was the result of continued economic hardship in our market areas, particularly for the commercial real estate business. 52 Table of Contents If the nonaccrual and restructured loans as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period (or since origination if held for part of the period), gross interest income in the amounts of approximately $8,724,000, $8,136,000 and $9,800,000 for nonaccrual loans and $1,873,000, $1,943,000 and $1,200,000 for restructured loans would have been recorded for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Interest income on such loans that was actually collected and included in net income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 amounted to approximately $2,578,000, $3,195,000 and $2,147,000 for nonaccrual loans (prior to their being placed on nonaccrual status), and $1,351,000, $1,342,000, and $866,000 for restructured loans, respectively. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had no commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose loans were nonperforming. Management routinely monitors the status of certain large loans that, in management’s opinion, have credit weaknesses that could cause them to become nonperforming loans. In addition to the nonperforming loan amounts discussed above, management believes that an estimated $5 million of non-covered loans and $16 million of covered loans that were performing in accordance with their contractual terms at December 31, 2011 have the potential to develop problems depending upon the particular financial situations of the borrowers and economic conditions in general. Management has taken these potential problem loans into consideration when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 (see discussion below). Loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss, doubtful, substandard, or special mention that have not been disclosed in the problem loan amounts and the potential problem loan amounts discussed above do not represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results, liquidity, or capital resources, or represent material credits about which management is aware of any information that causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms. Other real estate includes foreclosed, repossessed, and idled properties. Non-covered other real estate has increased over the past three years, amounting to $37.0 million at December 31, 2011, $21.1 million at December 31, 2010, and $8.8 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we also held $85.3 million, $94.9 million and $47.4 million, respectively, in other real estate that is subject to loss share agreements with the FDIC. We believe that the fair values of the items of other real estate, less estimated costs to sell, equal or exceed their respective carrying values at the dates presented. The following table presents the detail of our other real estate at each of the past two year ends: At December 31, 2011 (1) At December 31, 2010 (1) Vacant land $ 76,341 81,185 1-4 family residential properties 33,724 28,146 Commercial real estate 12,230 6,641 Other — — Total other real estate $ 122,295 115,972 (1) Includes both covered and non-covered real estate. 53 Table of Contents The following segregates our other real estate at December 31, 2011 into covered and non-covered: Covered Other Real Estate Non-covered Other Real Estate Total Other Real Estate Vacant land $ 59,994 16,347 76,341 1-4 family residential properties 17,362 16,362 33,724 Commercial real estate 7,916 4,314 12,230 Other — — — Total other real estate $ 85,272 37,023 122,295 The following segregates our other real estate at December 31, 2010 into covered and non-covered: Covered Other Real Estate Non-covered Other Real Estate Total Other Real Estate Vacant land $ 72,878 8,307 81,185 1-4 family residential properties 18,691 9,455 28,146 Commercial real estate 3,322 3,319 6,641 Other — — — Total other real estate $ 94,891 21,081 115,972 Allowance for Loan Losses and Loan Loss Experience The allowance for loan losses is created by direct charges to operations (known as a “provision for loan losses” for the period in which the charge is taken). Losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans, in management’s opinion, become uncollectible. The recoveries realized during the period are credited to this allowance. We consider our procedures for recording the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy. See the heading “Critical Accounting Policies” above for further discussion. The factors that influence management’s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense include past loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, evaluation of probable inherent losses and current economic conditions. We use a loan analysis and grading program to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. In this program, credit risk grades are assigned by management and tested by an independent third party consulting firm. The testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans, loans we identify as having potential credit weaknesses, loans past due 90 days or more, loans originated by new loan officers, nonaccrual loans and any other loans identified during previous regulatory and other examinations. We strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with what management believes are conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market areas. Every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies. We have no foreign loans, few agricultural loans and do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions. Commercial loans are diversified among a variety of industries. The majority of loans captioned in the tables discussed below as “real estate” loans are personal and commercial loans where real estate provides additional security for the loan. Collateral for virtually all of these loans is located within our principal market area. The allowance for loan losses amounted to $41.4 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $49.4 million at December 31, 2010 and $37.3 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $5.8 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of the allowance for loan losses is attributable to covered loans that have exhibited credit quality deterioration due to lower collateral valuations, while the allowance for loan losses for non-covered loans amounted to $35.6 million and $38.3 million at those dates. For all prior periods, the entire allowance for loan losses is attributable to non-covered loans. 54 Table of Contents The ratio of the allowance for non-covered loan losses to non-covered loans was 1.72%, 1.84%, and 1.75%, as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The decrease in the percentage for 2011 is primarily attributable to lower specific reserves at December 31, 2011. The increased allowance percentage in 2010 was necessary due to the higher level of delinquencies and classified and nonperforming loans. Table 13 sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated. The amount of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses did not vary materially at any of the past three year ends. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb losses in all categories. Table 13a segregates the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 into covered and non-covered categories. As indicated in Tables 13 and 13a, the amount of the allowance allocated to “Real Estate – Construction and Land Development” declined by $5-$6 million from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This decline was due to charge-offs and the foreclosure and transfer to “other real estate” of a significant amount of covered land development loans. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover probable loan losses on the loans outstanding as of each reporting date. It must be emphasized, however, that the determination of the allowance using our procedures and methods rests upon various judgments and assumptions about economic conditions and other factors affecting loans. No assurance can be given that we will not in any particular period sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of conditions and factors then prevailing, will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses or future charges to earnings. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and losses on foreclosed real estate. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on the examiners’ judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations. For the years indicated, Table 14 summarizes our balances of loans outstanding, average loans outstanding, and a detailed rollforward of the allowance for loan losses. Table 14a presents a detailed rollforward of the 2011 and 2010 activity for the allowance for loan losses segregated into covered and non-covered activity. Net loan charge-offs of non-covered loans amounted to $31.2 million in 2011, $32.7 million in 2010, and $12.1 million in 2009. The elevated amounts in 2010 and 2011 reflect the impact of deteriorating loan quality that has been impacted by the economic downturn. Also in 2010 and 2011, we recorded $8.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively, in partial charge-offs of non-covered loans. Previously, we recorded specific reserves on collateral-deficient nonaccrual loans within the allowance for loans losses, but did not record charge-offs until the loans had been foreclosed upon. Net non-covered charge-offs as a percentage of average non-covered loans represented 1.52%, 1.55%, and 0.56%, during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. We recorded $18.1 million and $9.8 million in charge-offs of covered loans during 2011 and 2010, respectively, primarily related to collateral dependent nonaccrual loans for which we received updated appraisals that reflected lower valuations. 55 Table of Contents Deposits and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase At December 31, 2011, deposits outstanding amounted to $2.755 billion, an increase of $103 million from December 31, 2010. To begin 2011, deposits initially grew by $193 million as a result of the acquisition of The Bank of Asheville in January 2011. For the remainder of the year, our deposit base declined by $90 million as a lack of loan growth allowed us to reduce our reliance on higher cost deposits. Our NOW deposits increased approximately $131 million during 2011, with $31 million being assumed in The Bank of Asheville acquisition and another $38 million of the growth resulting from customers shifting their funds from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to a commercial interest bearing NOW account (discussed earlier). In 2011, despite the addition of $62 million in time deposits and $43 million in internet deposits from The Bank of Asheville acquisition, we experienced overall net declines in these categories of $73 million and $17 million, respectively, due to our ability to lessen our reliance on these higher cost deposits as a result of weak loan demand and growth in our other lower-cost deposit categories. In 2010, deposits declined from $2.933 billion to $2.653 billion, a decrease of $281 million, or 9.6%, from December 31, 2009. Approximately $237 million, or 84%, of the decline in deposits was attributable to decreases in time deposits. We also experienced a $70 million decrease in our NOW accounts during 2010, primarily as a result of two depositors who withdrew their funds during the last week of the year in anticipation of the expiration of certain provisions of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program. The nature of our deposit growth is illustrated in the table on page 46. The following table reflects the mix of our deposits at each of the past three year ends: 2011 2010 2009 Noninterest-bearing deposits 12 % 11 % 9 % NOW deposits 15 % 11 % 12 % Money market deposits 19 % 19 % 17 % Savings deposits 5 % 6 % 5 % Brokered deposits 6 % 5 % 3 % Internet deposits 1 % 2 % 4 % Time deposits > $100,000 - retail 21 % 23 % 24 % Time deposits < $100,000 - retail 21 % 23 % 26 % Total deposits 100 % 100 % 100 % Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as a percent of total deposits 1 % 2 % 2 % The deposit mix remained relatively consistent from 2009 to 2011. Our mix has gradually shifted over the past few years to a heavier concentration in transaction accounts and less concentration in our time deposits. The percentages for retail time deposits have declined because we have chosen not to match certain promotional time deposit interest rates being offered by several of our local competitors, which we felt were too high compared to alternative funding sources. Our growth in other categories of deposits and our weak loan demand eliminated the need to match the higher competitor rates. We routinely engage in activities designed to grow and retain deposits, such as (1) emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers, where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with us, (2) pricing deposits at rate levels that will attract and/or retain deposits, and (3) continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our appeal as a primary provider of financial services. Table 15 presents the average amounts of our deposits and the average yield paid for those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. 56 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we held approximately $753.2 million in time deposits of $100,000 or more. Table 16 is a maturity schedule of time deposits of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2011. This table shows that 66% of our time deposits greater than $100,000 mature within one year. At each of the past three year ends, we have no deposits issued through foreign offices, nor do we believe that we held any deposits by foreign depositors. Borrowings We had borrowings outstanding of $133.9 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $196.9 million at December 31, 2010 and $176.8 million at December 31, 2009. Borrowings decreased from 2010 to 2011 primarily as a result of a decline in loans and growth in deposits that provided funds to pay down our borrowings. During most of 2010, we held a lower level of borrowings until late in the year when we obtained borrowings to offset a portion of the liquidity decline we experienced as a result of the loss of deposits that was previously discussed. Table 2 shows that average borrowings were $122.7 million in 2011 compared to $79.8 million in 2010 and $151.2 million in 2009. At December 31, 2011, the Company had four sources of readily available borrowing capacity – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, of which $88 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $62 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $33 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond’s (FRB) discount window, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2011 and $55 million was outstanding at December 31, 2010, and 4) a $10 million holding company line of credit with a commercial bank (none of which was outstanding at December 31, 2011 or 2010). Our line of credit with the FHLB can be structured as either short-term or long-term borrowings, depending on the particular funding or liquidity need, and is secured by our FHLB stock and a blanket lien on most of our real estate loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2011, none of the $88 million outstanding with the FHLB were overnight borrowings. All the FHLB borrowings were at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of 1.36% and maturity dates ranging from April 2012 to June 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the average amount of FHLB borrowings outstanding was approximately $76 million with a weighted average interest rate for the year of 1.49%. The maximum amount of short-term FHLB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011 was $92 million. In addition to the outstanding borrowings from the FHLB that reduce the available borrowing capacity of the line of credit, our borrowing capacity was further reduced by $203 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as a result of our pledging letters of credit backed by the FHLB for public deposits at each of those dates. Our correspondent bank relationship allows us to purchase up to $50 million in federal funds on an overnight, unsecured basis (federal funds purchased). We had no borrowings under this line at December 31, 2011. We had $33 million outstanding under this line at December 31, 2010 with a weighted average interest rate of 0.65%. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at any month-end during 2011. We also have a line of credit with the FRB discount window. This line is secured by a blanket lien on a portion of our commercial and consumer loan portfolio (excluding real estate loans). Based on the collateral that we owned as of December 31, 2011, the available line of credit was approximately $79 million. At December 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under this line. At December 31, 2010, we had $55 million in borrowings outstanding under this line. There were no FRB borrowings outstanding at any month-end during 2011. 57 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a $10 million holding company line of credit with a correspondent bank that was secured by 100% of the common stock of our bank subsidiary. This line of credit expires and is subject to renewal in March of each year. The line of credit had no outstanding balance at December 31, 2011 or 2010, and was not drawn upon during 2011 or 2010. In addition to the lines of credit described above, in which we had $88 million and $150 million outstanding as of December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively, we also had a total of $46.4 million in trust preferred security debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010. We have initiated three trust preferred security issuances since 2002 totaling $67.0 million, with one of those issuances for $20.6 million being redeemed in 2007. These borrowings each have 30 year final maturities and were structured in a manner that allows them to qualify as capital for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. We may call these debt securities at par on any quarterly interest payment date five years after their issue date. We issued $20.6 million of this debt on October 29, 2002 (which we called in 2007), an additional $20.6 million on December 19, 2003, and $25.8 million on April 13, 2006. The interest rate on these debt securities adjusts on a quarterly basis at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.70% for the securities issued in 2003, and three-month LIBOR plus 1.39% for the securities issued in 2006. Liquidity, Commitments, and Contingencies We have a pending agreement to purchase eleven branches of another bank with approximately $180 million in total deposits and $98 million in total loans. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Our liquidity is determined by our ability to convert assets to cash or to acquire alternative sources of funds to meet the needs of our customers who are withdrawing or borrowing funds, and our ability to maintain required reserve levels, pay expenses and operate the Company on an ongoing basis. Our primary liquidity sources are net income from operations, cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and other short-term investments. Our securities portfolio is comprised almost entirely of readily marketable securities which could also be sold to provide cash. As noted above, in addition to internally generated liquidity sources, we currently (March 2012) have the ability to obtain borrowings from the following four sources – 1) an approximately $389 million line of credit with the FHLB, 2) a $50 million overnight federal funds line of credit with a correspondent bank, 3) an approximately $79 million line of credit through the FRB’s discount window and 4) a holding company line of credit with a limit of $10 million. Our overall liquidity increased slightly during 2011 compared to 2010. Our loans decreased by $24 million, while our deposits increased by $103 million. As a result, our liquid assets (cash and securities) as a percentage of our total deposits and borrowings increased from 15.4% at December 31, 2010 to 15.7% at December 31, 2011. We continue to believe our liquidity sources, including unused lines of credit, are at an acceptable level and remain adequate to meet our operating needs in the foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity position carefully and will explore and implement strategies to increase liquidity if deemed appropriate. In the normal course of business we have various outstanding contractual obligations that will require future cash outflows. In addition, there are commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit, that may or may not require future cash outflows. Table 18 reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2011. Any of our $88 million in outstanding borrowings with the FHLB may be accelerated immediately by the FHLB in certain circumstances, including material adverse changes in our condition or if our qualifying collateral is less than the amount required under the terms of the borrowing agreement. 58 Table of Contents In the normal course of business there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities such as commitments to extend credit, which are not reflected in the financial statements. The following table presents a summary of our outstanding loan commitments as of December 31, 2011: ($ in millions) Type of Commitment Fixed Rate Variable Rate Total Outstanding closed-end loan commitments $ 39 278 317 Unfunded commitments on revolving lines of credit, credit cards and home equity loans 32 185 217 Total $ 71 463 534 At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we also had $7.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding. We had no carrying amount for these standby letters of credit at either of those dates. The nature of the standby letters of credit is that of a guarantee made on behalf of our customers to suppliers of the customers to guarantee payments owed to the supplier by the customer. The standby letters of credit are generally for terms of one year, at which time they may be renewed for another year if both parties agree. The payment of the guarantees would generally be triggered by a continued nonpayment of an obligation owed by the customer to the supplier. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted) we could be required to make under the guarantees in the event of nonperformance by the parties to whom credit or financial guarantees have been extended is represented by the contractual amount of the financial instruments discussed above. In the event that we are required to honor a standby letter of credit, a note, already executed by the customer, becomes effective providing repayment terms and any collateral. Over the past two years, we have had to honor only a few standby letters of credit, which involved insignificant amounts of funds and have been or are being repaid by the borrower without any loss to us. We expect any draws under existing commitments to be funded through normal operations. It has been our experience that deposit withdrawals are generally replaced with new deposits, thus not requiring any net cash outflow. Based on that assumption, management believes that it can meet its contractual cash obligations and existing commitments from normal operations. We are not involved in any legal proceedings that, in management’s opinion, could have a material effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company. Capital Resources and Shareholders’ Equity Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2011 amounted to $345.2 million compared to $344.6 million at December 31, 2010. The two basic components that typically have the largest impact on our shareholders’ equity are net income, which increases shareholders’ equity, and dividends declared, which decreases shareholders’ equity. Additionally, any stock issuances can significantly increase shareholders’ equity. In 2011, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were the redemption of $65.0 million of our Series A Preferred Stock issued under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program (also known as TARP) and the simultaneous issuance of $63.5 million of Series B Preferred Stock under the Treasury’s Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). Net income of $13.6 million for 2011 increased equity, while common stock dividends declared of $5.4 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.2 million reduced equity. We also recorded accretion of the discount on preferred stock of $2.9 million due to the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. (See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on these transactions.) Another significant factor negatively impacting equity in 2011 was a $4.5 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss that was caused by an increase in our pension liability. The increase in the pension liability was primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates on the actuarial calculations involved in determining the liability. Our policy is to use the Citigroup Pension Index yield curve in the computation of the pension liability. At December 31, 2011, that index had a weighted average rate of 4.39%, which was a decline from the rate of 5.59% at December 31, 2010. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity. 59 Table of Contents In 2010, the most significant factors that impacted our equity were net income of $10.0 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.4 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.3 million, which reduced equity. See the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity within the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of other less significant items affecting shareholders’ equity. In 2009, the most significant item that impacted our equity was our issuance of $65 million in preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, other significant factors were net income of $60.3 million, which increased equity, and common stock dividends declared of $5.3 million and preferred stock dividends declared of $3.2 million, which reduced equity. See the consolidated financial statements for other less significant factors that impacted equity in 2009. We are not aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities or otherwise which, if they were to be implemented, would have a material effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. The Company and the Bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. These capital standards require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of “Tier 1” capital to total risk-weighted assets (“Tier I Capital Ratio”) and total capital to risk-weighted assets (“Total Capital Ratio”) of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively. Tier 1 capital is comprised of total shareholders’ equity, excluding unrealized gains or losses from the securities available for sale, less intangible assets, and total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus certain adjustments, the largest of which for the Company and the Bank is the allowance for loan losses. Risk-weighted assets refer to the on- and off-balance sheet exposures of the Company and the Bank, adjusted for their related risk levels using formulas set forth in FRB and FDIC regulations. In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described above, the Company and the Bank are subject to a leverage capital requirement, which calls for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital (as defined above) to quarterly average total assets (“Leverage Ratio) of 3.00% to 5.00%, depending upon the institution’s composite ratings as determined by its regulators. The FRB has not advised us of any requirement specifically applicable to the Company. Table 21 presents our regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. All of our capital ratios have significantly exceeded the minimum regulatory thresholds for all periods covered by this report. In addition to the minimum capital requirements described above, the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action also contains specific capital guidelines for a bank’s classification as “well capitalized.” The specific guidelines are as follows – Tier I Capital Ratio of at least 6.00%, Total Capital Ratio of at least 10.00%, and a Leverage Ratio of at least 5.00%. If a bank falls below “well capitalized” status in any of these three ratios, it must ask for FDIC permission to originate or renew brokered deposits. The Bank’s regulatory ratios exceeded the threshold for “well-capitalized” status at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 – see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a table that presents the Bank’s regulatory ratios. 60 Table of Contents In addition to shareholders’ equity, we have supplemented our capital in past years with trust preferred security debt issuances, which because of their structure qualify as regulatory capital. This was necessary in past years because our balance sheet growth outpaced the growth rate of our capital. Additionally, we have frequently purchased bank branches over the years that resulted in our recording intangible assets, which negatively impacted regulatory capital ratios. As discussed in “Borrowings” above, we have issued a total of $67.0 million in trust preferred securities since 2002, with the most recent issuance being a $25.8 million issuance that occurred in April 2006. We currently have $46.4 million in trust preferred securities outstanding. In this economic environment, our goal is to maintain our capital ratios at levels at least 200 basis points higher than the “well-capitalized” thresholds set for banks. At December 31, 2011, our total risk-based capital ratio was 16.72% compared to the 10.00% “well-capitalized” threshold. In addition to regulatory capital ratios, we also closely monitor our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets (“TCE Ratio”). Our TCE ratio was 6.58% at December 31, 2011 compared to 6.52% at December 31, 2010. See “Supervision and Regulation” under “Business” above and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of other matters that may affect our capital resources. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Derivative Financial Instruments Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements pursuant to which we have obligations or provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of this kind other than letters of credit and repayment guarantees associated with our trust preferred securities. Derivative financial instruments include futures, forwards, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. We have not engaged in derivatives activities through December 31, 2011 and have no current plans to do so. Return on Assets and Equity Table 20 shows return on assets (net income available to common shareholders divided by average total assets), return on common equity (net income available to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders’ equity), dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by net income per common share) and shareholders’ equity to assets ratio (average total shareholders’ equity divided by average total assets) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011. Interest Rate Risk (Including Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Item 7A.) Net interest income is our most significant component of earnings. Notwithstanding changes in volumes of loans and deposits, our level of net interest income is continually at risk due to the effect that changes in general market interest rate trends have on interest yields earned and paid with respect to our various categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It is our policy to maintain portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities with maturities and repricing opportunities that will afford protection, to the extent practical, against wide interest rate fluctuations. Our exposure to interest rate risk is analyzed on a regular basis by management using standard GAP reports, maturity reports, and an asset/liability software model that simulates future levels of interest income and expense based on current interest rates, expected future interest rates, and various intervals of “shock” interest rates. Over the years, we have been able to maintain a fairly consistent yield on average earning assets (net interest margin). Over the past five calendar years, our net interest margin has ranged from a low of 3.74% (realized in 2008) to a high of 4.72% (realized in 2011). During that five year period, the prime rate of interest has ranged from a low of 3.25% (which was the rate as of December 31, 2011) to a high of 8.25%. The consistency of the net interest margin is aided by the relatively low level of long-term interest rate exposure that we maintain. At December 31, 2011, approximately 82% of our interest-earning assets are subject to repricing within five years (because they are either adjustable rate assets or they are fixed rate assets that mature) and substantially all of our interest-bearing liabilities reprice within five years. 61 Table of Contents Table 17 sets forth our interest rate sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2011, using stated maturities for all fixed rate instruments except mortgage-backed securities (which are allocated in the periods of their expected payback) and securities and borrowings with call features that are expected to be called (which are shown in the period of their expected call). As illustrated by this table, at December 31, 2011, we had $682 million more in interest-bearing liabilities that are subject to interest rate changes within one year than earning assets. This generally would indicate that net interest income would experience downward pressure in a rising interest rate environment and would benefit from a declining interest rate environment. However, this method of analyzing interest sensitivity only measures the magnitude of the timing differences and does not address earnings, market value, or management actions. Also, interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. In addition to the effects of “when” various rate-sensitive products reprice, market rate changes may not result in uniform changes in rates among all products. For example, included in interest-bearing liabilities subject to interest rate changes within one year at December 31, 2011 are deposits totaling $1.084 billion comprised of NOW, savings, and certain types of money market deposits with interest rates set by management. These types of deposits historically have not repriced with, or in the same proportion, as general market indicators. Overall we believe that in the near term (twelve months), net interest income will not likely experience significant downward pressure from rising interest rates. Similarly, we would not expect a significant increase in near term net interest income from falling interest rates. Generally, when rates change, our interest-sensitive assets that are subject to adjustment reprice immediately at the full amount of the change, while our interest-sensitive liabilities that are subject to adjustment reprice at a lag to the rate change and typically not to the full extent of the rate change. In the short-term (less than six months), this results in us being asset-sensitive, meaning that our net interest income benefits from an increase in interest rates and is negatively impacted by a decrease in interest rates. However, in the twelve-month horizon, the impact of having a higher level of interest-sensitive liabilities lessens the short-term effects of changes in interest rates. The Federal Reserve has made no changes to interest rates since 2008, and since that time the difference between market driven short-term interest rates and longer-term interest rates has generally widened, with short-term interest rates steadily declining and longer term interest rates not declining by as much. The higher long term interest rate environment enhanced our ability to require higher interest rates on loans. As it relates to funding, we have been able to reprice many of our maturing time deposits at lower interest rates. We were also able to generally decrease the rates we paid on other categories of deposits as a result of declining short-term interest rates in the marketplace and an increase in liquidity that lessened our need to offer premium interest rates. Our net interest margin increased throughout 2010 and 2011. Our net interest margin was 4.72% for 2011, a 33 basis point increase from the 4.39% margin realized in 2010. As previously discussed in the section “Net Interest Income,” our net interest income was impacted by certain purchase accounting adjustments related primarily to our acquisitions of Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville. The purchase accounting adjustments related to the premium amortization on loans, deposits and borrowings are based on amortization schedules and are thus systematic and predictable. The accretion of the loan discount on loans acquired from Cooperative Bank and The Bank of Asheville, which amounted to $11.6 million and $7.6 million for 2011 and 2010, respectively, is less predictable and could be materially different among periods. This is because of the magnitude of the discounts that were initially recorded ($280 million in total) and the fact that the accretion being recorded is dependent on both the credit quality of the acquired loans and the impact of any accelerated loan repayments, including payoffs. If the credit quality of the loans declines, some, or all, of the remaining discount will cease to be accreted into income. If the underlying loans experience accelerated paydowns or are paid off, the remaining discount will be accreted into income on an accelerated basis, which in the event of total payoff will result in the remaining discount being entirely accreted into income in the period of the payoff. Each of these factors is difficult to predict and susceptible to volatility. 62 Table of Contents Based on our most recent interest rate modeling, which assumes no changes in interest rates for 2012 (federal funds rate = 0.25%, prime = 3.25%), we project that our net interest margin for 2012 will remain relatively consistent with the net interest margins recently realized. With interest rates having been stable for a relatively long period of time, most of our interest-sensitive assets and interest-sensitive liabilities have been repriced at rates near today’s interest rates. We have no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes, nor do we maintain any foreign currency positions. Table 19 presents the expected maturities of our other than trading market risk sensitive financial instruments. Table 19 also presents the estimated fair values of market risk sensitive instruments as estimated in accordance with relevant accounting guidance. Our assets and liabilities have estimated fair values that do not materially differ from their carrying amounts. See additional discussion regarding net interest income, as well as discussion of the changes in the annual net interest margin, in the section entitled “Net Interest Income” above. Inflation Because the assets and liabilities of a bank are primarily monetary in nature (payable in fixed determinable amounts), the performance of a bank is affected more by changes in interest rates than by inflation. Interest rates generally increase as the rate of inflation increases, but the magnitude of the change in rates may not be the same. The effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as its influence on those businesses that have large investments in plant and inventories. During periods of high inflation, there are normally corresponding increases in the money supply, and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets, loans and deposits. Also, general increases in the price of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses. Current Accounting Matters We prepare our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with standards established by, among others, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”). Because the information needed by users of financial reports is dynamic, the FASB frequently issues new rules and proposes new rules for companies to apply in reporting their activities. See Note 1(t) to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent rule proposals and changes. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

		<c><![CDATA[ . Management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) reviews significant factors with respect to our financial condition and results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. The following MD&A concerning our operations is intended to satisfy three principal objectives: Provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that enables investors to see the company through the eyes of management; Enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which our financial information should be analyzed; and, Provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance. Management’s discussion and analysis, like other portions of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. However, our anticipated future financial performance involves risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements. A cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements is set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis should be considered in light of that cautionary statement. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes, tables, and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. All figures are in thousands, except per share data and per employee data. 16 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW Results of Operations Earnings reached a record high of $3.37 per share in 2011 (on net income of $5,305) compared to earnings of $3.04 per share in 2010 (on net income of $4,754), an increase of 11% per share. During 2011, higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income $386, or 2%, while credit and foreclosure costs remained historically high at $2,587 compared to $2,644 during 2010. Noninterest and fee income during 2011 was largely unchanged compared to 2010, while operating expenses, excluding loss on foreclosed assets, declined $495, or 3%, from $277 lower FDIC insurance premium expense and $145 lower debit card losses following a significant fraud loss during 2010. During 2011, total nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1%, due to a $3,837 increase in troubled debt that has been restructured but continues to pay according to its restructured terms. However, nonaccrual assets decreased $315, or 3.5%, and foreclosed assets decreased $2,028, or 40.8% during 2011. Total nonperforming assets were $17,883, or 2.87% of total assets as of December 31, 2011 compared $16,389, or 2.64% of total assets as of December 31, 2010. During 2012, we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during 2011, based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin. While interest rates are not expected to change significantly during 2012, an initial period of rising interest rates should be expected to reduce net interest margin and potentially net interest income as funding costs increase with rising rates but floating rate loan yields remain at their floors for a time. In addition, a falling rate environment would lower loan yields to a greater extent than further deposit price reductions, pressuring net interest margin and income. During 2012, credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write-down of foreclosed asset values compared to 2011. However, we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned. Due to stabilization of historically low long-term interest rates on residential mortgages, we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during 2012. In addition, regulatory changes effective during 2010 for overdraft fee income and in 2011 for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during 2012. Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs. Taken together, net income growth during 2012 is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during 2011 and 2010. Earnings were $3.04 per share in 2010 (on net income of $4,754) compared to earnings of $2.00 per share in 2009 (on net income of $3,116). During 2010, higher net interest margin increased tax equivalent net interest income $2,103, or 12%, while income also benefited from a $2,186, or 45%, decline in credit and foreclosure losses compared to 2009. Net interest income increased primarily from maintenance of interest rate floors on adjustable rate loans while deposit costs continued to fall. Offsetting this increase to income was decreased noninterest and fee income, down $213 during 2010, or 4%, primarily from 2009 recognition of a $521 gain on sale of securities. Operating expenses increased $1,096, or 7%, and included increased salaries and employee benefits of $1,015, up 14%, and higher all other operating expenses (excluding foreclosure costs) of $362, or 6%. Salaries and benefits expense increased primarily from an annual increase in base pay, fewer deferred loan origination costs, and increased year-end incentive and profit sharing expense based on net income levels achieved. Earnings were $2.00 per share in 2009 (on net income of $3,116) compared to earnings of $2.13 per share in 2008 (on net income of $3,301). However, both years experienced nonrecurring items related to sale of securities and disposal of premises and equipment. Pro-forma net income before these special items was $2,859 in 2009 and $3,909 in 2008, a net income decline of 27% during 2009. The 2009 decline was due to significantly higher provision for loan losses, loss on sale of foreclosed assets, and higher FDIC insurance expense. Offsetting a portion of these increased expenses during 2009 were increases in net interest income from higher net interest margin and record levels of mortgage banking income. Each of these factors was influenced by falling market interest rates occurring during the national recession then in effect. Liquidity Total assets increased $1,774, or less than 1%, to $622,867 at December 31, 2011 compared to $621,093 at December 31, 2010. While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged, disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased $5,221, or 5%. Total net loans receivable increased $5,756, or 1%, to $437,557 at December 31, 2011. Offsetting this increase in assets was a $4,154 decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets. Asset growth during 2012 is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt. Core deposits increased $14,872 during 2011 from a $17,366 increase in year-end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Increased 2011 deposits were used to repay $11,820 of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year-end. Wholesale borrowings, including brokered and national deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale repurchase agreements increased $425 during 2011. Wholesale borrowings were $138,190 at December 31, 2011 compared to $137,765 at December 31, 2010. Our most significant sources of liquidity and wholesale funding include federal funds purchased from correspondent banks, FHLB advances, brokered and national certificates of deposit, and Federal Discount Window advances. In addition to the federal funds sold position of $21,571, we have $237,982 of unused funding available at December 31, 2011, which is considered adequate to meet customer, operational, and growth needs during 2012. Most of our wholesale funding sources require either pledging of assets, maintenance of well-capitalized regulatory status, or additional purchases of FHLB capital stock (or all of these items) to continue or expand participation in the funding program. In particular, $42,099 of potential FHLB advance funding considered available at December 31, 2011, would require additional purchase of up to $2,105 of their capital stock, which pays a nominal dividend and for which no trading market exists. 17 Table of Contents Due in part to an expected reduction to future debit card income in response to Dodd-Frank legislation and a qualifying account structure which required payment of a significantly greater than market rate of interest, we discontinued sale of our Rewards Checking product during 2011. Rewards Checking was a retail high yield interest bearing checking account with account usage qualifications to earn the premium interest rate. Qualifications included receipt of the monthly account statement via email, at least 10 debit card purchases per month, and at least 1 electronic transfer per month. During 2011, Rewards Checking paid qualifying accounts a 2.01% annual percentage yield on the first $25,000 of balance and reimbursed customer ATM fees. Since its introduction during 2007, Rewards Checking had been our primary source of retail deposit growth. Absence of the Reward Checking product from our retail deposit product line could negatively impact future deposit growth. Total assets increased $14,239, or 2%, at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The majority of the increase was in cash and cash equivalents, up $13,994, as core deposits increased $16,186, or 5%. The core deposit increase in 2010 was driven by a $9,989 increase in our Rewards Checking high yielding NOW account and a large $7,167 commercial money market account opened during 2010 by a related party. A decline in net loans receivable of $5,832, or 1%, primarily from lower commercial related loans was offset by increased investment securities and purchased bank certificates of deposit totaling $4,678, up 4%. An increase in other borrowings and stockholders’ equity of $7,521 along with the increase in deposits previously mentioned contributed to a reduction in wholesale deposits and FHLB advances of $11,089 during 2010. Brokered deposits, FHLB advances and wholesale repurchase agreements were $137,765 at December 31, 2010, down $18,089, or 12%, from $155,854 at December 31, 2009 Capital Resources We are considered well-capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of 14.99% at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.27% at December 31, 2010 and 12.49% at December 31, 2009. Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of 10.00% to be considered well-capitalized. During 2011, regulatory capital increased from higher retained earnings (up 14% over earnings retained during 2010) while risk adjusted assets increased just 2%. During 2010, total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to 50% risk weighting, rather than the 100% risk weighting assigned in prior years. In addition, we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during 2010 which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio. These changes, along with retained 2010 net income, increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than 2009. On a book basis, total tangible common equity reflected on the December 31, 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheets was 8.09% compared to 7.52% at December 31, 2010 and 6.97% at December 31, 2009. In response to Dodd-Frank legislation, banking regulatory agencies are expected to announce higher minimum capital standards for banks to be considered well capitalized during 2012. We issued $7,000 of 8% senior subordinated notes during 2009 which may be repaid in full during 2012 at our option and mature in 2019. Approximately 21% of our total regulatory capital is comprised of debt instruments including junior and senior debentures and notes which, unlike common stock, require quarterly payments of interest. Therefore, although no current plans exist, future capital needs during the next several years would likely be met by issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock as needed. We expect to continue to pay our traditional semi-annual cash dividend assuming continued profitable operations and projections of adequate future capital levels for growth and credit risk. In addition, any future growth through merger and acquisition activities should be expected to drain excess capital levels and could increase the likelihood of a new common or preferred stock capital raise, potentially diluting existing stockholders. Several years of low asset growth and high earnings levels have raised book and regulatory capital ratios to historically high levels. For example, our total regulatory capital ratio has increased from 10.63% at December 31, 2008 to 14.99% at December 31, 2011. Due to projected low levels of organic loan growth available in our existing markets and expectations for improving problem loan trends, we are evaluating actions which could utilize excess capital to build shareholder value. Our primary focus is on market and core deposit expansion via merger and acquisition of other banks with relatively low credit risk profiles and near our current markets. If value added merger and acquisition options do not materialize in the near term, we may consider repayment of our existing senior subordinated notes or resumption of our traditional stock repurchase program on the open market. Such actions would decrease existing capital ratios but would be expected to increase net income or net book value per share. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Our largest volume off-balance sheet activity involves our servicing of payments and related collection activities on approximately $262 million of residential 1 to 4 family mortgages sold to FHLB and FNMA, up $2 million from $260 million at December 31, 2010. Serviced mortgage loans increased from customer refinance activity, a trend which began during 2009 when serviced loans increased $52 million, or 28%, and continued with serviced loans increasing $22 million, or 9.4% during 2010. As expected we experienced significantly slower growth during 2011 and we may not see significant organic growth in serviced loans in future years. Proposals by the U.S. Treasury concerning FNMA and the FHLB could reduce the amount of annual servicing income (currently .25% of serviced mortgage balances annually) paid to us to service future mortgages originated and sold to them. 18 Table of Contents We have provided a credit enhancement against FHLB loss on approximately 20% of the serviced principal, up to a maximum guarantee of $1.9 million in the aggregate. However, we would incur such loss only if the FHLB first lost $1.9 million on this loan pool of approximately $52 million. No sold loans have received our credit enhancement guarantee of principal since October 2008 and we have no intentions of originating future loans with the guarantee. Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in 2000, only $0.3 million of $425 million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss, all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account. All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities. Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations. During 2011, we experienced a $37 loss from repurchase of a foreclosed loan with underwriting violations related to private mortgage insurance. We reviewed our remaining portfolio of loans with similar origination circumstances and do not have a material exposure to future loss for loans underwritten in the same manner. Absent this 2011 loss, we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since 2000 and have not been required to repurchase any other loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expected to be required to repurchase loans in the near term. We provide various commitments to extend credit for both commercial and consumer purposes totaling approximately $99 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $98 million at December 31, 2010. These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Our primary long-term contractual obligations are related to repayment of funding sources such as FHLB advances, long-term other borrowings, and customer time deposits, which make up 93% of our total long-term contractual obligations. For all contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2011, 34% will require repayment or refinancing during 2012 although virtually 100% of these 2012 obligations represent time deposits taken in the normal course of business. During 2011, we originated a program to offer certain high credit quality customers fixed interest rate swaps to hedge their risk on variable rate commercial real estate loans with us. Fixed interest rate swaps sold to customers (in which we pay a variable rate and receive a fixed rate) are simultaneously offset by our purchase of a variable interest rate swap from a correspondent bank (in which we pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate). Such swap sale programs are often referred to “back to back” interest rate swaps as the resulting fixed interest rate risk with our customer is offset by our variable rate risk with our counterparty. At December 31, 2011, there were $14,324 in back to back swaps outstanding with variable rate commercial real estate loan customers. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings Table 1 of Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K presents various financial performance ratios and measures for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011. A number of separate or nonrecurring factors impacted our earnings during 2007 through 2009 but none have had a significant impact to net income during 2011 and 2010. Table 2 presents our net income for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011, before certain tax-adjusted nonrecurring income and expense items. Table 2: Summary Operating Income Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Net income before special items, net of tax $ 5,277 $ 4,770 $ 2,859 $ 3,909 $ 3,932 Net gain (loss) on write-down and sale of securities 19 (12 ) 316 (600 ) – Net gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment 9 (4 ) (59 ) (8 ) 8 Reduction to tax expense from favorable Tax Court decision – – – – 200 Net income $ 5,305 $ 4,754 $ 3,116 $ 3,301 $ 4,140 Diluted earnings per share before special items $ 3.35 $ 3.05 $ 1.83 $ 2.52 $ 2.50 Diluted earnings per share as reported $ 3.37 $ 3.04 $ 2.00 $ 2.13 $ 2.64 19 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 Net earnings during 2011 were $5,305, or $3.37 per diluted share, compared to $4,754, or $3.04 per diluted share during 2010, an increase of $551 ($.33 per share), up 11.6%. 2011 net income increased over the prior year due to increased net interest income of $458, up 2.4%, due to a slight increase in net margin and average earning assets. Credit costs totaled $2,587 during 2011, a slight decline of $57, or 2.2%, compared to 2010, primarily from lower provision for loan losses while loss on foreclosed assets increased from higher partial write-downs of value. Noninterest income decreased $26 during 2011, or 0.5%, from a decline in service charges (primarily overdraft charges) and mortgage banking totaling $253 which was partially offset by $207 in swap sale commission income (a new product during 2011). Excluding credit costs, noninterest expenses declined $495, or 3.3%, primarily from a $277 reduction in FDIC insurance premiums. Return on average assets was .87% and .79% during 2011 and 2010, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.78% and 10.59% during 2011 and 2010, respectively. During 2012, we expect net interest income to remain similar to that seen during 2011, based on low levels of organic asset growth and a stable to slightly declining net interest margin. During 2012, credit and foreclosure costs are expected to decline significantly due to projected lower partial write-down of foreclosed asset values compared to 2011. However, we continue to work through existing problem loans and foreclosed assets and expect higher levels of troubled debt restructured loans which could increase credit and foreclosure costs greater than planned. Due to stabilization of historically low long-term interest rates on residential mortgages, we expect a decline in mortgage refinance activity and mortgage banking income during 2012. In addition, regulatory changes effective during 2010 for overdraft fee income and during 2011 for debit card interchange income are expected to lower these sources of fee income during 2012. We expect 2012 noninterest income to be less than 2011 due to these factors. Operating expenses are expected to experience an inflationary increase primarily from higher data processing system costs. Taken together, net income growth during 2012 is expected to be difficult and dependant on the extent to which credit and foreclosed property costs can be reduced compared to levels seen during 2011 and 2010. 2010 compared to 2009 Earnings reached a then record high of $3.04 per share during 2010, an increase of 52% over 2009 earnings of $2.00 per share. Increased earnings were led by higher net interest income of $2,148 (up 12.7% from increased net interest margin) and significantly lower credit and foreclosure costs, down $2,186 (45%) from 2009. 2010 earnings also benefited from continued high levels of mortgage banking refinance income, which although less than in 2009, continued at historically high levels. Service fees increased $338, or 23.3% from changes to our customer courtesy overdraft program during 2010 which recognized increased customer overdraft activity. These increases to income were offset by higher salaries and employee benefits, up $1,105 (13.6%) from several factors including an annual increase in base wages, lower deferral of direct loan origination expenses, and higher year-end incentive costs from meeting income growth goals. Data processing costs increased $217, or 22.7%, due in part to conversion to a new service bureau data processing system and related training and implementation costs. Because the initial data processing contract called for reduced fees during the initial implementation period, data processing fees are expected to increase significantly during 2011. Return on average assets was .79% and .54% during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 10.59% and 7.38% during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 compared to 2008 Earnings were $2.00 per share during 2009 on net income of $3,116 which declined 6% from 2008 earnings of $2.13 per share on net income of 3,301. However, earnings per share before special or nonrecurring items were $1.83 in 2009 on pro-forma net income of $2,859 compared to $2.52 in 2008 on pro-forma net income of $3,909, a decline of $1,050, or 27%. The net decline in 2009 was due primarily to significantly greater credit related costs including combined provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed assets expense of $4,830 during 2009 compared to $891 in 2008, an increase of over 500%. These increased credit costs reduced 2009 net income by approximately $2,387 after income tax benefits compared to 2008. During 2009, a national economic recession that began during 2008 reduced borrower ability to repay loans due to us, increasing current net charge offs during 2009 as well as our expectation of future charge offs from existing economic factors in effect at that time. The majority of the loss on foreclosed assets was a $1,004 loss on a large land development foreclosure taken to auction during 2009. In addition to credit losses, FDIC insurance expense premiums increased from $284 in 2008 to $986 in 2009 as Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserves declined from payouts to certain depositors of failed banks in the United States. FDIC insured banks as an industry were required to pay increased quarterly premiums as well as a special assessment to recapitalize the DIF. Increased 2009 FDIC insurance expense lowered net income by approximately $425 after tax benefits compared to 2008. Offsetting these increased expenses, tax adjusted net interest income and mortgage banking income increased $3,365 during 2009 compared to 2008 due to falling market interest rates caused by the economic recession. The low interest rate environment prompted customers to refinance residential mortgages with us which we subsequently sold on the secondary market. We also increased net interest income as very low short-term interest rates were used to fund moderately longer dated and higher yielding loans and securities including adjustable rate loans with interest rate floors. These factors increased 2009 net income by approximately $2,039 after tax expense. 20 Table of Contents Return on average assets was .54% and .61% during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Return on average stockholders’ equity was 7.38% and 8.63% during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Excluding the 2008 FNMA preferred stock write-down, return on average assets would have been .72% during 2008 and return on average equity would have been 10.20%. Balance Sheet Changes and Analysis Summary balance sheets at December 31 for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2011 are presented in Table 1 of Item 6 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Total assets increased $1,774, or 0.3%, during the year ended December 31, 2011, after increasing $14,239 (2.3%) during the year ended December 31, 2010 and increasing $36,368 (6.4%) during the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2011 asset growth rate continued a decline first seen during 2010 related to low customer loan demand as customers sought to reduce their debt obligations amidst economic uncertainty. Presented in Table 3 below is a summary balance sheet for the five years ended December 31, 2011 as a percentage of total assets. Table 3: Summary Balance Sheet as a Percent of Total Assets As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents 6.1 % 6.5 % 4.3 % 2.3 % 4.0 % Securities 17.5 % 17.4 % 17.5 % 18.0 % 18.2 % Total loans receivable, net of allowance 70.3 % 69.5 % 72.1 % 74.4 % 72.5 % Premises and equipment, net 1.6 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.9 % 2.1 % Bank owned life insurance 1.8 % 1.8 % 1.7 % 1.7 % 1.6 % Other assets 2.7 % 3.1 % 2.7 % 1.7 % 1.6 % Total assets 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Total deposits 77.4 % 75.0 % 75.5 % 75.0 % 75.3 % FHLB advances 8.0 % 9.2 % 9.6 % 11.4 % 10.7 % Other borrowings 3.2 % 5.1 % 4.6 % 4.5 % 4.9 % Senior subordinated notes 1.1 % 1.1 % 1.2 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Junior subordinated debentures 1.2 % 1.2 % 1.3 % 1.4 % 1.4 % Other liabilities 1.0 % 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.7 % 0.8 % Stockholders’ equity 8.1 % 7.5 % 7.0 % 7.0 % 6.9 % Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 2011 compared to 2010 Total assets increased $1,774, or less than 1%, to $622,867 at December 31, 2011 compared to $621,093 at December 31, 2010. While commercial related loan balances remained unchanged, disbursed residential real estate mortgage loans increased $5,221, or 5%. Total net loans receivable increased $5,756, or 1%, to $437,557 at December 31, 2011. Offsetting this increase in assets was a $4,154 decline in cash equivalents and foreclosed assets. Asset growth during 2012 is expected to be negatively impacted by projected low levels of organic loan growth and continued borrower desire to reduce existing debt in current economic conditions. Core deposits increased $14,872 during 2011 from a $17,366 increase in year-end temporary and seasonal noninterest bearing deposits withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Increased 2011 deposits were used to repay $11,820 of local overnight repurchase agreements classified as other borrowings at year-end. Wholesale borrowings, including brokered and national deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale repurchase agreements increased $425 during 2011 and were $138,190 at December 31, 2011 compared to $137,765 at December 31, 2010. Wholesale funding to total assets was 22.2% at December 31, 2011 and 2010. 2010 compared to 2009 Total assets were $621,093 at December 31, 2010 compared to $606,854 at December 31, 2009, an increase of $14,239, or 2.3%. The majority of the increase was reflected in increased cash and cash equivalents, up $13,994, or 53% during 2010. Commercial related loans declined $9,128 (2.7%) as locally owned small and medium sized business credit demand declined and we continued to work out of existing problem credits. Offsetting the decline in loan balances were increased investment securities and purchased certificates of deposit, which increased $4,678, or 4.4%, and an increase in residential mortgage lending, up $4,506, or 4.4%. 21 Table of Contents Core deposits increased $16,186, or 4.9% during 2010, although increases in interest bearing demand and money market deposits of $25,512 (13.6%) offset a $7,819 decline (7.0%) in local certificates of deposit. The combination of low customer loan demand and unusually high local competitor certificate of deposit pricing lessoned our demand for local certificate of deposit funding and contributed to the decline in balances. At December 31, 2010, money market funding included $7,167 from a new account relationship obtained during the year from a related party. In addition to the increase in local deposits, overnight repurchase agreement funding from local customers (reflected as other borrowings) increased $10,101, or 128%, during 2010 from acquisition of a new account relationship totaling $8,585 at December 31, 2010. These two large commercial relationships totaling $15,752 at December 31, 2010 were seasonal and declined significantly during 2011. Increased local deposits were used to repay wholesale deposits and FHLB advances during 2010, which declined $11,089, or 8.2%. All wholesale funding, including brokered deposits, FHLB advances, and wholesale other borrowings declined $18,089, or 11.6%, to $137,765 during 2010 compared to $155,854 at December 31, 2009. Wholesale funding to total assets was 22.2% and 25.7% at December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between interest earned on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expense associated with the deposits and borrowings that fund them. Interest rate fluctuations together with changes in volume and types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities combine to affect total net interest income. Additionally, net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to change in interest rates, contractual maturities, and repricing frequencies. Net interest income is our most significant item of revenue generated by operations. Table 4 presents changes in the mix of average earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the three years ending December 31, 2011. In general, net interest income earned on loans funded by savings and demand deposits is greater than that earned on securities funded by time deposits. Therefore, a balance sheet that contains a growing allocation of loans funded by a growing allocation of savings and demand deposits would normally provide greater net interest income than a growing allocation of securities funded by a growing allocation of time deposits.

Table 7: Yield on Earning Assets Year ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Yield Change Yield Change Yield Change Yield on earning assets 5.08% -0.29% 5.37% -0.16% 5.53% -0.47% Effective rate on all liabilities as a percent of earning assets 1.53% -0.33% 1.86% -0.42% 2.28% -0.74% Net yield on earning assets 3.55% 0.04% 3.51% 0.26% 3.25% 0.27% 2011 compared to 2010 Tax adjusted net interest income totaled $20,297 during 2011 compared to $19,911 in 2010, an increase of $386, or 1.9%, from a 0.7% increase in average earning assets during 2011 and a slight increase in net margin from 3.51% in 2010 to 3.55% in 2011. Compared to 2010, loan yield declined from 5.77% to 5.55% (22 basis points) while the tax adjusted investment security yield declined from 4.51% to 3.87% (64 basis points). Continued low overall interest rate levels and very low investment security reinvestment rates caused yield on earning assets to decline as did the cost of paying liabilities, which declined from 2.12% to 1.77% (35 basis points). The market rate decline experienced in the national economy during the 2008-2009 recession continues, and loans, securities, and funding continue to reprice lower to current rate levels. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $8,086 during 2011 compared to $10,506 during 2010. Based on the average loan yield during 2011, the decrease in nonaccrual loans during 2011 increased net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during 2011 compared to 2010. During 2011, cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately 8 basis points. Average earning assets grew $4,007, or 0.7% during 2011, driven by a $6,297 increase in taxable securities, primarily mortgage related investment securities. Average interest bearing liabilities decreased $4,891, or 1.0% during 2011. The primary funding source that decreased was time deposits, declining $13,287, or 7.2%. The changes made to the Rewards Checking account structure and removal of the product from our retail deposit lineup were effective late in 2011, which allowed average product balances to continue to increase during 2011. Average Rewards Checking balances were $48,674 during 2011 compared to $43,264 in 2010, an increase of $5,410, or 12.5%. Average Rewards Checking balances had increased $11,651, or 36.9% during 2010 after growing $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009. Since the account changes, product balances have declined slightly and were $47,578 at December 31, 2011. 24 Table of Contents We have increased net interest margin since 2009 by inserting interest rate floors in commercial-related loans and retail residential home equity lines of credit to avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin from a sustained low interest rate environment and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market. The coupon rate on approximately 22% of gross loans at December 31, 2011 was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately 139 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate. At December 31, 2011, approximately 82% of our $122 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and, of those loans with floors, virtually 100% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate, approximately 76% of principal have “in the money” loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. If current interest rate levels were assumed to remain the same, the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin would be approximately $1,387 and .24%, respectively, based on those existing loan floors and average total earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2011. During a period of rising short-term interest rates, we expect average funding costs (which are not currently subject to contractual caps on the interest rate) to rise while the yield on loans with interest rate floors would remain the same until those loans’ adjustable rate index caused coupon rates to exceed the loan rate floor. The speed in which short-term interest rates increase is expected to have a significant impact on net interest income from loans with interest rate floors. Quickly rising short-term rates would allow adjustable rate loans with floors to reprice to rates higher than the existing floor more quickly, impacting net interest income less adversely than if short-term rates rose slowly or deliberately. Because a future increase in short-term funding rates could cause a mismatch between floating rate loan yields and short-term funding costs due to existing interest rate floors, such positions are modeled and reviewed as part of our asset-liability management strategy each quarter. Current interest rate simulations based on more extreme rate scenarios such as short-term rates up 500 basis points combined with a flattening of the yield curve during a 12 month period could reduce net interest income by 4.9% to 8.4% ($577 to $958 after tax impacts) per year during the first three years of the rate increase. We seek to minimize this interest rate risk exposure in part by maintaining the fixed rate period of wholesale funding typically longer than the average term for local deposit funding. Wholesale funding is approximately 22% of total assets and carried an approximately 28 month fixed rate term as of December 31, 2011. Reinvestment yields for investment security cash flows remain very low and our securities portfolio yield is expected to continue to decline throughout 2012 as cash flows are reinvested in this low rate environment. In addition, loan yields are expected to decline slightly due to competitive pressures as banks seek to increase loan originations while quality credit demand remains weak. These declines in earning asset rates are expected to be only partially offset by further declines in certificate of deposit funding costs and nonmaturity deposit costs with 2012 net interest margin anticipated to continue in a range of 3.45% to 3.55% during 2012. During 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act repealed the prohibition on paying interest on commercial checking accounts. We currently provide an earnings credit against account fees in lieu of an interest payment and do not expect costs to increase because of this change in the short term. Despite the law change, we do not sell or promote an interest bearing commercial checking account at this time. However, the change could have greater long-term implications as competitor banks begin to use premium interest rate levels on commercial deposits in attempts to raise deposits in coming years. Also during 2011, President Obama’s administration announced changes to the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP), a program first initiated in March 2009. The original program was intended to allow homeowners to refinance their mortgages if they were current on payments and owed between 80% and 105% the value of their homes. Because a limited number of borrowers took advantage of the plan, HARP has now been expanded to allow current borrowers to refinance their mortgage no matter how far the mortgage exceeds the home value. This change could impact the speed of prepayments experienced by investors such as us who hold mortgage related securities backed by borrowers who could benefit from program participation. New or unexpected prepayment on mortgage related securities can impair unamortized purchase premiums paid to obtain high coupon investments in the existing low interest rate environment. At December 31, 2011, we held only three mortgage related securities with high loan coupons expected to be impacted by the HARP program changes. Each of the securities carries an investment coupon of 5.50% and is backed by 30 year fixed rate mortgages issued between 2005 to 2008. Fair value of these securities was $4,340 (approximately 7% of our total mortgage related security portfolio) with an amortized cost of $4,012 and yielding 5.52% at December 31, 2011. Because the securities were held at an aggregate unamortized purchase discount of $5, accelerated purchase premium amortization for accelerated repayments do to the HARP program is not a concern. However, any prepayments on these or other mortgage related securities would be subject to reinvestment at much lower rates, lowering future net interest income, or reducing unrealized gains on securities currently held. 2010 compared to 2009 Cost of funding continued to decline much faster than loan yields during 2010 as loan yields were supported by placement of interest rate floors on floating rate loans. Tax adjusted net interest income increased 11.8% during 2010 with net interest margin increasing to 3.51% from 3.25% in 2009. The coupon rate on approximately 23% of gross loans at December 31, 2010 was supported by an average interest rate floor approximately 150 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate. 25 Table of Contents Impacts during and following the close of a national recession and government actions to support the economy, including actions by the Federal Reserve, reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads remained high for borrower risk across the banking industry. During 2010, loan yields were stable at 5.77% compared to 5.76% during 2009, while the cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing deposits) declined .47% to 1.53% from 2.00% during 2009. This .48% improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from 3.25% to 3.51% during 2010, an increase of .26%. Tempering the increase in loan to deposit spreads was a decline in yields on securities and other earnings assets of .71% to 3.93% while non-deposit liability funding (including Senior Subordinated Note and junior subordinated debenture funding) declined just .16% to 3.64%. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $10,506 during 2010 compared to $12,190 during 2009. Based on the average loan yield during 2010, the decrease in nonaccrual loans increased net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points during 2010 compared to 2009. During 2010, cumulative average nonaccrual loans reduced net interest margin by approximately 11 basis points. Average earning assets grew $20,493, or 3.7% during 2010, driven by an increase in overnight interest bearing funds of $7,912, or (138%) and an increase in average loans of $8,029, or 1.8%. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $19,929, or 4.2% during 2010. The primary source of increased average local funding was in our Rewards Checking product, which increased $11,651, or 36.9% during 2010 after growing $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009. Tax adjusted net interest income increased $2,103, or 11.8% to $19,911 during 2010 compared to $17,808 in 2009. An increase in average earning assets (changes in volume) contributed $480 of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed $1,623 of the increase. As in 2011, during 2010, loan yields were supported by interest rate floors that increase net interest margin. At December 31, 2010, approximately 94% of our $111 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and, of those loans with floors, approximately 98% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. Of those loans with current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable coupon rate, approximately 76% of principal had “in the money” loan floors which increased the adjustable rate between 100 basis points and 200 basis points. If those prior year rates were assumed to remain the same, the annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately $1,537 and .27%, respectively, based on those existing loan floors and total earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2010. 2009 compared to 2008 Cost of funding declined much faster than loan yields during 2009 in part due to systematic insertion of loan interest rate floors upon renewal during the year. Tax adjusted net interest income increased nearly 17% during 2009 with net interest margin increasing to 3.25% from 2.98% in 2008. The coupon rate on approximately 24% of gross loans at December 31, 2009 was supported by an average interest rate floor 150 basis points greater than the normal adjustable rate. During 2009, falling short-term interest rates caused by a national recession and government actions to support the economy, including actions by the Federal Reserve, reduced funding costs while loan yields declined more slowly as credit spreads increased for borrower risk across the banking industry. During 2009, loan yields declined .46% to 5.76% while the cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing deposits) declined .86% to 2.00%. This .40% improvement in loan yields compared to deposit costs drove net interest margin to increase from 2.98% to 3.25% during 2009, an increase of ..27%. Tempering the increase in loan to deposit spreads was a decline in yields on securities and other earnings assets of .52% to 4.64% while non-deposit liability funding (including Senior Subordinated Note and junior subordinated debenture funding) declined just .30% to 3.80%. Average nonaccrual loans totaled $12,190 during 2009 compared to $6,810 during 2008. Based on the average loan yield during 2009, the increase in nonaccrual loans lowered net interest margin by approximately 6 basis points during 2009 compared to 2008. Average earning assets grew $35,121, or 6.9% during 2009, driven by an increase in average loans of $29,836, or 7.4%. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $28,474, or 6.3% with the remaining source of average funding coming from a 8.1% increase in noninterest bearing deposits ($4,105) and increased stockholders’ equity of $3,960. The primary source of increased average local funding was in our Rewards Checking product, which increased $14,815, or 88.2% during 2009. Tax adjusted net interest income increased $2,555, or 16.8% to $17,808 during 2009 compared to $15,253 in 2008. An increase in average earning assets (changes in volume) contributed $1,164 of the increase in net interest income while changes in rate from an increase in net interest margin contributed $1,391 of the increase. As short term interest rates continued to fall during 2009, yields on adjustable rate loans tied to the prime and 30 day LIBOR rates had the potential to reprice at very low yields. To avoid the negative impacts to net interest margin and to appropriately price for credit risk in the current market, we began to systematically insert interest rate floors on commercial related adjustable rate loans and residential mortgage home equity lines of credit upon renewal. At December 31, 2009, approximately 85% of our $129 million in adjustable rate loans carried a contractual interest rate floor and of those loans with floors, approximately 97% carried current loan yields in excess of the normal adjustable rate coupon due to the interest rate floor. The weighted average amount in which actual loan yields were supported by the “in the money” loan rate floor was approximately 150 basis points on $106 million of adjustable rate loans at December 31, 2009. The annualized increase to net interest income and net interest margin was approximately $1,588 and .28%, respectively based on these existing loan floors and total average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2009 if interest rates were assumed to remain the same. 26 Table of Contents Net interest income during 2009 benefited from incremental investment income from a leveraged security purchase completed late in 2007. In the transaction, we purchased approximately $15,000 in mortgage backed securities funded by $13,500 of a mix of floating rate and fixed rate structured repurchase agreement funding. The initial spread on the transaction was 1.39% at closing. During 2009, an increase in credit spreads on mortgage related products combined with falling short-term rates worked together to increase the transaction spread to an average of 2.97% during 2009 compared to an average spread of 2.24% during 2008. This transaction added approximately $99 in additional net interest income during 2009 compared to 2008 and approximately $401 of total gross leveraged investment net interest income during 2009. Details on the structure of the related purchase agreements can be found in Item 8, Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The funding source for this leverage security transaction reset from a short-term floating rate to a long-term fixed rate late in 2009, reducing the current transaction spread to less than 1.00%. The decline in transaction spread reduced 2010 net interest income from this arrangement by approximately $266 compared to 2009. By December 31, 2011, spread on the transaction had declined to .12% and was not a significant contributor to net interest income during 2011. As investment security yields continue to fall while the related funding source remains fixed, we expect the transaction to produce a small amount of negative spread (or loss) to net interest income during 2012 and likely through 2014 when $8,000 of the funding matures. Interest Rate Sensitivity We incur market risk primarily from interest-rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities. Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. We actively monitor and manage our interest-rate risk exposure. The measurement of the market risk associated with financial instruments (such as loans and deposits) is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on- and off-balance sheet transactions are aggregated, and the resulting net positions are identified. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that reflect changes in market prices and rates can be found in Item 8, Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our primary objective in managing interest-rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital, while adjusting the asset-liability structure to obtain the maximum yield-cost spread on that structure. We rely primarily on our asset-liability structure reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to control interest-rate risk. In general, longer-term earning assets are funded by shorter-term funding sources allowing us to earn net interest income on both the credit risk taken on assets and the yield curve of market interest rates. However, a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact earnings, to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent, or on the same basis. We do not engage in significant trading activities to enhance earnings or for hedging purposes. Our overall strategy is to coordinate the volume of rate sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of interest rate movement on the net interest margin. Table 8 represents our earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates at December 31, 2011. It is a static indicator which does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment, particularly during periods when the interest yield curve is flattening or steepening. The following repricing methodologies should be noted: 1. Public or government fund MMDA and NOW accounts are considered fully repriced within 60 days. Higher yielding retail and non-governmental money market and NOW deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within 90 days. Rewards Checking NOW accounts and lower rate money market deposit accounts are considered fully repriced within one year. Other NOW and savings accounts are considered “core” deposits as they are generally insensitive to interest rate changes. These core deposits are generally considered to reprice beyond five years. 2. Nonaccrual loans are considered to reprice beyond 5 years. 3. Assets and liabilities with contractual calls or prepayment options are repriced according to the likelihood of the call or prepayment being exercised in the current interest rate environment. 4. Measurements taking into account the impact of rising or falling interest rates are based on a parallel yield curve change that is fully implemented within a 12-month time horizon. 5. Bank owned life insurance is considered to reprice beyond 5 years. Table 8 reflects an asset sensitive (“positive”) gap position during the next year, with a cumulative one-year gap ratio as of December 31, 2011 of 107.9% compared to a negative gap (liability sensitive position) of 93.0% at December 31, 2010. In general, a current positive gap position would be favorable in a rising rate environment, but unfavorable in a falling rate environment. However, net interest income is impacted not only by the timing of product repricing, but the extent of the change in pricing which could be severely limited from local competitive pressures. This factor can result in changes to net interest income from changing interest rates different than expected from review of the gap table. 27 Table of Contents Table 8: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands) 0-90 Days 91-180 days 181-365 days 1-2 yrs.

These policies are intended to limit exposure of earnings at risk. A formal liquidity contingency plan exists that directs management to the least expensive liquidity sources to fund sudden and unanticipated liquidity needs (Refer to the section labeled “LIQUIDITY” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We also use various policy measures to assess interest rate risk as described below. 28 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Limits We balance the need for liquidity with the opportunity for increased net interest income available from longer term loans held for investment and securities. To measure the impact on net interest income from interest rate changes, we model interest rate simulations on a quarterly basis. Our policy is that projected net interest income over the next 12 months will not be reduced by more than 15% given a change in interest rates of up to 200 basis points. Table 9 presents the projected impact to net interest income by certain rate change scenarios and the change to the one year cumulative ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities. Table 9: Net Interest Margin Rate Simulation Impacts As of December 31: 2011 2010 2009 Cumulative 1 year gap ratio Base 108% 93% 88% Up 200 104% 89% 84% Down 100 111% 95% 92% Change in Net Interest Income – Year 1 Up 200 during the year -2.1% -2.5% -3.3% Down 100 during the year -0.7% -1.0% -1.1% Change in Net Interest Income – Year 2 No rate change (base case) -5.1% -2.4% 0.1% Following up 200 in year 1 -3.5% -2.6% -2.0% Following down 100 in year 1 -9.8% -7.5% -5.9% Note: Simulations after December 2007 reflect net interest income changes from a down 100 basis point scenario, rather than a down 200 basis point scenario. To assess whether interest rate sensitivity beyond one year helps mitigate or exacerbate the short-term rate sensitive position, a quarterly measure of core funding utilization is made. Core funding is defined as liabilities with a maturity in excess of 60 months and capital. Core deposits including DDA, NOW, and non-maturity savings accounts (except high yield NOW such as Rewards Checking deposits and money market accounts) are also considered core long-term funding sources. The core funding utilization ratio is defined as assets that reprice in excess of 60 months divided by core funding. Our target for the core funding utilization ratio is to remain at 80% or below given the same 200 basis point changes in rates that apply to the guidelines for interest rate risk limits exposure described previously. Our core funding utilization ratio after a projected 200 basis point increase in rates was 61.9% at December 31, 2011 compared to 76.7% and 81.6% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This ratio declined during 2011 due to a decrease in the average life within the investment security portfolio combined with an increase in the core deposit categories noted above. The high level of the core funding utilization ratio at December 31, 2009 in the up 200 basis point scenario was due to projected extension in principal payments on residential mortgage loans held in the loan portfolio as well as residential mortgage related securities held in the investment securities portfolio. At December 31, 2009, in the up 200 basis point scenario, securities and loan principal to reprice in 5 years or longer increased approximately $16,635, or 25%. Over 80% of this change was due to changes related to residential mortgage loans or related securities. Although above the internal target of 80%, this level was considered manageable and monitored quarterly. 29 Table of Contents At December 31, 2011, internal interest rate simulations that project interest rate changes that maintain the current shape of the yield curve (often referred to as “parallel yield curve shifts”) estimated relatively small projected changes to future years’ net interest income, even in more extreme periods of interest rate changes such as up 400 basis points during a 24 month period. However, if interest rates were to increase more quickly than anticipated and if the yield curve flattened at the same time, such as in a “flat up 500 basis point” change occurring during 2012, net interest income would decline during the first three years of the simulation in amounts ranging from 4.9% to 8.4% of the base simulation’s net interest income ($953 to $1,581 per year). When the yield curve flattens, repriced short-term funding cost, such as for terms of one year or less increases, while maturing fixed rate balloon loans, such as with terms from 3 to 5 years, increase much less. During flattening periods, assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but to a much different extent. Current net interest income sensitivity to a rising and flattening yield curve is similar to that seen at December 31, 2010 when similar “flat up 500 basis point” projections indicated net interest income would decline during the first two years of the simulation in amounts ranging from 4.9% to 5.0% of the base simulation’s net interest income. While not expected during 2012, in future years interest rates could rise to levels significantly greater than today and exhibit a flattening interest yield curve. To minimize such interest rate risk, we typically extend the average fixed term of our wholesale funding portfolio of brokered certificates and FHLB advances. Extending such funding may decrease net interest income in the current environment (since funding with short-term interest rate costs would be less expensive), but does provide additional protection against rising interest rates in future years. At December 31, 2011, the average fixed rate term of the wholesale funding portfolio was 28 months. During 2012, we expect the average fixed term of the wholesale portfolio to decline in anticipation of an extended period of low interest rates and to better manage net interest income in an extended low rate environment. Wholesale funding was 22.2% of total assets at December 31, 2011. Although the flat up 500 basis points simulation is projected to negatively impact net interest income, we have significant risk to a prolonged period of low or falling rates in the already low rate environment. In this situation, loan and security yields continue to decline while funding costs reach effective lows, reducing net interest margin, particularly if average credit spreads were to decline to levels seen prior to 2008 (pre recessionary levels). In the down 100 basis point scenario in the December 31, 2011 income simulations, net interest income is projected to decline as follows compared to the current “base rate” scenario: $ % Year 1 - $ 141 0.7% Year 2 - $ 903 4.9% Year 3 - $ 1,379 7.4% Year 4 - $ 1,954 10.0% Year 5 - $ 2,286 11.7% Despite recent rate volatility and periodic continued declines in market interest rates, management does not consider such a protracted low interest rate environment to be likely, but continues to monitor its asset-liability position in light of this potential long-term risk to net interest income levels. Investment Securities Portfolio The investment securities portfolio is intended to provide us with adequate liquidity, flexible asset/liability management, and a source of stable income. During 2009, all securities were classified as available for sale and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses were excluded from earnings, but reported as other comprehensive income in a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income tax. However, during 2010, the municipal security portfolio and nonrated trust preferred securities and senior subordinated notes with fair value totaling $54,130 (including unrealized gain of $2,552) were transferred from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. These securities were transferred to better reflect our intent and practice to hold these long-term securities until maturity and to minimize potential volatility to stockholders’ equity from future changes in unrealized gains and losses in a rising interest rate environment. As securities held to maturity, changes in unrealized gains and losses after the transfer date are not reflected in stockholders’ equity and these securities are recorded at amortized cost. The original unrealized gain of $2,552 on the security transfer date is being amortized against the new cost basis (equal to transfer date fair value) over the remaining life of the securities. Table 10 presents the fair value of securities held by us at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. 30 Table of Contents Table 10: Investment Securities Distribution – At Fair Value As of December 31 2011 2010 2009 Fair % of Fair % of Fair % of Securities available for sale : Value Portfolio Value Portfolio Value Portfolio U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government agencies $ 518 0.47% $ 1,041 0.97% $ 10,227 9.63% Obligations of states and political subdivisions – 0.00% – 0.00% 47,178 44.44% U.S. agency residential mortgage backed securities 19,816 18.00% 17,690 16.54% 23,868 22.48% U.S. agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations 38,573 35.02% 35,511 33.21% 22,346 21.04% Privately issued residential collateralized mortgage obligations 429 0.39% 980 0.92% 936 0.88% Nonrated trust preferred securities – 0.00% – 0.00% 1,562 1.47% Other equity securities 47 0.04% 51 0.05% 68 0.06% Total securities available for sale 59,383 53.92% 55,273 51.69% 106,185 100.00% Securities held to maturity : Obligations of states and political subdivisions 49,010 44.50% 49,806 46.58% – 0.00% Nonrated trust preferred securities 1,332 1.21% 1,456 1.36% – 0.00% Nonrated senior subordinated notes 409 0.37% 400 0.37% – 0.00% Total securities held to maturity 50,751 46.08% 51,662 48.31% – 0.00% Total investment securities $ 110,134 100.00% $ 106,935 100.00% $ 106,185 100.00% At December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any single issuer where the aggregate carrying value of such securities exceeded 10% of stockholders’ equity, except for combined senior debentures and guaranteed mortgage related securities issued by U.S. Agencies such as the FHLB, FNMA, or FHLMC. Securities with an approximate fair value of $56,659, and $60,111, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were pledged primarily to secure public deposits, customer overnight repurchase agreements (classified as other borrowings), and for other purposes required by law, representing approximately 53% and 57% of securities eligible for pledging at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Securities considered ineligible for pledging include privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations, other equity securities, and nonrated trust preferred and senior subordinated note securities. As a member of the FHLB system, we are required to hold stock in the FHLB based on borrowings advanced to Peoples State Bank. This stock has a purchase cost and par value of $100 per share. We held $3,250 of FHLB Chicago stock at December 31, 2011 and 2010. The current capital stock level supports FHLB total advances of $65,000. The stock is recorded at cost which approximates market value. Transfer of the stock is substantially restricted. The FHLB may pay dividends in both cash and additional shares of stock. An annualized dividend rate of .10% was paid on FHLB stock during 2011. No dividends were paid during 2010 or 2009. The FHLB of Chicago currently operates under a capital management plan required by their regulatory oversight body, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. We cannot predict if the cash dividends will continue or if they may be increased. Due to a heightened level of regulatory oversight and in recognition of stock transfer restrictions, our investment in FHLB stock has been evaluated for impairment, with no other than temporary impairment write-down deemed necessary at December 31, 2011. Table 11 categorizes securities by scheduled maturity date as of December 31, 2011 and does not take into account the existence of optional calls held by the security issuer. Therefore, actual funds flow from maturing securities may be different than presented below. Maturity of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, some of which call for scheduled monthly payments of principal and interest, are categorized by average principal life of the security. Yields by security type and maturity are based on amortized security cost. 31 Table of Contents Table 11: Investment Securities Maturities and Rates After one but After five but Within one year within five years within ten years After ten years As of December 31, 2011 Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield Securities available for sale : U.

Investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions declined $796, or 1.6% as maturity proceeds were reinvested in mortgage related securities. Upon purchase, the mortgage related securities carried average principal lives generally ranging from 3 to 5 years with well defined repayment cash flows. During 2011, we purchased no additional Qualified School Construction Bonds such as we did in 2010 and 2009 and held $4,803 of such bonds at December 31, 2011 compared to $4,995 and $3,872 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These bonds do not carry a stated interest rate, but instead pay a federal income tax credit as a fixed percentage of the bond principal that we use to offset our federal taxable income. At December 31, 2011, this portfolio carried a tax adjusted yield of 4.97% and an average stated maturity of approximately 5.9 years and were considered a general obligation of the issuing local government authority. Virtually all of our municipal investment holdings are considered general obligations of the local taxing authority. At December 31, 2011, approximately 77% of all municipal obligations in the portfolio were from issuers in Wisconsin compared to 79% of all municipal obligations at December 31, 2010. The privately issued residential mortgage obligations held of $429 and $980 at December 31, 2011 and 2010 as shown in Table 10 are rated AAA and represent fully amortizing mortgage loan pools originated during 2004 or prior years which are considered to carry very low risk of loss. These whole loan pools include loans which could be classified as conforming loans with FNMA or FHLMC except that loan principal was greater than the jumbo loan limit of these agencies at the time the loans were originated. Principal repayment of these securities is not guaranteed against loss by any government agency but is wholly dependent on borrower repayments and strength of the home values in the collateral pool. 32 Table of Contents The non-rated trust preferred securities were issued by three banks headquartered in Wisconsin with management teams known to us including Johnson Financial Group, Inc., River Valley Bancorporation, Inc., and Northern Bankshares, Inc. The non-rated senior subordinated notes were issued by McFarland State Bank, a subsidiary of Northern Bankshares, Inc. After a significant loss during 2010, Johnson Financial Group, Inc. elected to defer payments of interest on their trust preferred security issue, causing us to classify the $750 par value investment as a nonperforming asset. During 2011, the owners of Johnson Financial Group entered into an agreement with regulators to recapitalize the bank, significantly improving its capital position and stability. We cannot predict when Johnson Financial Group may resume payment of interest on this issue and we intend to classify it as nonperforming until interest payments begin. We regularly review the financial performance of Johnson Financial Group and the other banks associated with our trust preferred and senior subordinated note investments. None of the securities were considered other than temporarily impaired at December 31, 2011. The fair value of the securities available for sale as a percentage of book value based on original amortized cost trended higher during 2011 as falling market reinvestment rates improved the value of fixed rate securities already held in our portfolio. At December 31, 2011, fair value was 103.0% of amortized cost compared to 100.3% of amortized cost at December 31, 2010. As noted previously, during 2010, municipal securities were reclassified from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity. Fair value of municipal securities at the transfer date is reflected in stockholders’ equity as comprehensive income and will be amortized against the new cost basis over the remaining life of the securities. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial States for additional information. The net unrealized gain on securities transferred to securities held to maturity and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity was $1,124, net of taxes of $760 at December 31, 2011. The net unrealized gain on securities available for sale, recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity, was $1,162, net of deferred taxes of $727 at December 31, 2011. Unrealized securities gains and losses, net of income tax effects, do not impact the level of regulatory capital under current banking regulations. We believe investment security yields have a stabilizing effect on net interest margin during periods of interest rate swings and expect to hold existing securities until maturity or repayment unless such funds are needed for liquidity due to unexpected loan growth or depositor withdrawals or if the sale is beneficial to our interest rate risk and return profile. Periods of rising interest rates would likely decrease the unrealized fair value of fixed rate securities in our portfolio. During 2012, we expect to reinvest maturing securities cash flow into securities with average lives generally between 3 to 4 years and to minimize growth in our municipal securities portfolio whose securities have fixed terms generally from 10 to 11 years. These actions are designed to reduce our interest rate and market risks inherent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at this time. In addition, agency securities are considered to be a higher quality collateral asset for pledging purposes than municipal securities, which increases contingency liquidity sources. 2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, fair value of investments in obligations of states and political subdivisions as shown in Table 10 increased $2,628, or 5.6% while agency mortgage related securities increased $6,987, or 15.1%, and agency debentures declined $9,186, or 90%. Agency debentures matured during a period of very low reinvestment rates for similar debentures so funds were invested in higher yielding U.S. Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”). The fair value of the investment portfolio as a percentage of book value based on original amortized cost trended higher for most of 2010 as falling market reinvestment rates improved the value of fixed rate securities already held in our portfolio. However, transfer of the municipal security portfolio during 2010 from securities available for sale to securities held to maturity increased the amortized cost basis to the fair value of the securities at the time of transfer. Following the transfer, longer-term interest rates increased, which caused fair value of fixed rate municipal securities to fall below their new book value. At December 31, 2010, fair value was 100.3% of amortized cost compared to 102.8% of amortized cost at December 31, 2009. The net unrealized gain on securities transferred to securities held to maturity and recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity was $1,471, net of taxes of $929 at December 31, 2010. The net unrealized gain on securities available for sale, recorded as a component of stockholders’ equity, was $1,071, net of deferred taxes of $669 at December 31, 2010. 33 Table of Contents Loans Receivable Total loans as presented in Table 12 include loans held for sale to the secondary market and expected final fully disbursed principal on construction loans not yet fully disbursed at year-end.

Approximately 75% of fully disbursed commercial real estate loans (excluding construction and development loans) are considered to be owner occupied at December 31, 2011. We have little lending activity for agricultural purposes. Our management is involved in the communities we serve and believes it has a strong understanding of the local economy, its business leaders, and trends in successful business development. Based on this knowledge, we offer flexible terms and efficient approvals which have allowed us to grow and manage this type of lending. As part of the asset/liability and interest rate sensitivity management strategy, we generally do not retain long-term 20 to 30 year fixed rate mortgages in our own portfolio. Therefore, it is our practice to sell the majority of long-term fixed rate mortgage loan originations to secondary market agencies in exchange for a fee. From time to time, we retain second mortgage loans, on certain high value homes requiring total financing above the conforming secondary market limit, after selling the first mortgage into the secondary market. In addition, some local borrowers require mortgage financing that does not fit one of the secondary market programs, cannot qualify for secondary market financing because they cannot obtain a qualifying appraisal due to lack of comparable sales, or the borrower prefers us to hold the loan in our own portfolio. First and second mortgage loans on the balance sheet generally carry fixed rate balloon payment terms of five years or less. Consumer and individual loans include short-term personal loans, automobile and recreational vehicle installment loans, and credit card loans. We experience extensive competition from local credit unions offering low rates on installment loans and therefore direct resources toward more profitable lending categories such as residential fixed rate mortgages and commercial real estate lending. However, due to income tax advantages, many customers borrow on a tax deductible home equity line of credit for many purposes formerly funded by a consumer installment loan. Therefore, we consider consumer purpose lending to be represented by the combination of consumer and individual lending and residential mortgage home equity. 34 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 Loans held for investment continue to consist primarily of commercial related loans, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 74% of total loans at December 31, 2011 compared to 75% of total loans at December 31, 2010. All construction and land development loans, including commercial and 1-4 family residential construction loan commitments were approximately 7.4% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2011 compared to 7.9% at December 31, 2010. Loans in this classification are primarily short-term loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial real estate, such as multi-family or other commercial development projects. We retain permanent financing on these projects following completion of construction in a majority of cases. Construction loans also include residential new construction single family homes originated in the normal course of business which are typically sold in the secondary market upon completion of construction. Loan growth opportunities were limited during calendar 2011 and 2010 and gross loans outstanding (including loans held for sale) at December 31, 2011 increased $5,340, or 1.2%. Gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2010 decreased $5,047, or 1.1%, compared to December 31, 2009. Our prospect customer and loan pipeline report increased modestly over that seen during 2010 but primarily from companies with larger credit needs as larger companies appear to be recovering from a slow economy faster than smaller companies. In addition, pipeline growth has been with relationships estimated to have a 40% to 80% likelihood of closing. Until small business credit quality and demand improve, our loan growth is likely to be volatile as we seek to originate larger credits with relatively healthy companies while competing against many banks seeking to organically grow their loan portfolios. Significantly, our organic local loan growth was difficult during 2011 as economic conditions have lowered borrower demand for debt in our markets. In addition, large regional banks in our markets, including BMO Harris Bank, who during 2011 acquired M&I Bank’s market leading share position, are aggressively pursuing loan growth with our market’s highest credit quality customers with low loan coupon rates and spreads. These actions could keep loan growth levels low during 2012 or contribute to a decline in our net interest margin as we compete within our markets. Based on availability of local funding during 2012, we may seek out participation purchased loans originated by other banks on properties in Wisconsin with an emphasis on credit quality as the primary purchase criteria if local loan growth is not available to meet budgeted asset growth. Total participation loans purchased and held in our loan portfolio totaled $12,196, or 2.7% of gross loans presented in Table 12 at December 31, 2011 compared to $13,305, or 3.0% of gross loans at December 31, 2010. 2010 compared to 2009 Total loans receivable presented in Table 12 decreased $3,738, or ..8%, to $445,124 during 2010 after increasing 2.7% to $448,862 during 2009. Local commercial customer demand for increased credit for expansion decreased significantly during the second half of 2009 and remained low during all of 2010 with commercial related loans declining in 3 out of 4 quarters. When combined with real estate construction and development loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans decreased $5,070 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The decline in commercial real estate loans was due in part to work out of a problem construction and development loan with a loan balance of $3,446 at December 31, 2009 that was resolved in 2010 with net amounts transferred to foreclosed assets of $1,700. The transfer represented 56% of all loan principal transferred to foreclosed assets during 2010. This decline was offset by a $4,796, or 7.2%, increase in closed end residential mortgage loans. Although we normally sell originations of long-term fixed rate residential mortgages, late in 2010 we retained $10,589 of such loan originations with an average fully amortizing term of 215 months and a fixed rate of 4.53% using investment security cash flows due to very low security reinvestment rates. All construction and land development loans, including commercial and 1-4 family residential construction loan commitments were approximately 7.9% of total loans receivable at December 31, 2010 compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2009. Loans Receivable Maturities Table 13 categorizes loan principal by scheduled maturity at December 31, 2011, and does not take into account any prepayment options held by the borrower. The loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers, industry groups, and market areas. Significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic conditions. At December 31, 2011, no concentrations existed in our portfolio in excess of 10% of total loans except for a geographical concentration of borrowers and collateral located in Marathon County, Wisconsin in which we have the majority of our branches and operations representing approximately 73% of the loan portfolio. 35 Table of Contents Table 13: Loan Maturity Distribution and Interest Rate Sensitivity Loan Maturity One year Over one year Over As of December 31, 2011: or less to five years five years Commercial, industrial, municipal, and agricultural $ 66,988 $ 47,590 $ 12,614 Commercial real estate mortgage 57,701 112,354 14,305 Real estate construction 22,005 10,311 1,181 Residential real estate mortgage 16,266 24,860 36,988 Residential real estate mortgage held for sale 39 Residential real estate home equity 23 22,264 906 Consumer and individual 1,301 2,247 184 Totals $ 164,323 $ 219,626 $ 66,178 Fixed rate $ 164,531 $ 53,059 Variable rate 55,095 13,119 Totals $ 219,626 $ 66,178 Credit Quality Provision for Loan Losses The loan portfolio is our primary asset subject to credit risk. Our process for monitoring credit risk includes quarterly analysis of loan quality, delinquencies, nonperforming assets, and potential problem loans. An allowance for loan losses is maintained for incurred losses inherent but yet unidentified in the loan portfolio due to past conditions as well as for specifically identified problem loans. The allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio based on current economic conditions. Provisions to the allowance for loan losses are recorded as a reduction to income. Actual loan loss charge offs are charged against the allowance for loan losses. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed via ongoing credit quality review and grading of the loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, trends in past due and nonperforming loans, existing economic conditions, loss exposure by loan category, and estimated future losses on specifically identified problem loans. We have an internal risk analysis and review staff that continuously reviews loan quality. Accordingly, the amount charged to expense is based on our multi-factor evaluation of the loan portfolio. It is our policy that when available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, including impaired loans, are uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the allowance. In addition to coverage from the allowance for loan losses, nonperforming loans are secured by various collateral including business, real estate and consumer collateral. Loans charged off are subject to ongoing review and specific efforts are taken to maximize recovery of principal, accrued interest, and related expenses. Nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1%, to $17,883 (2.87% of total assets) at December 31, 2011, from $16,389 (2.64% of total assets) at December 31, 2010 as restructured loans to troubled borrowers that performed according to restructured terms increased by $3,837, or 161.0%. Although these restructured loans are accruing interest, they are still classified as nonperforming loans. Approximately 52% of total nonperforming assets are made up of nine individual nonperforming assets greater than $500 at December 31, 2011. Approximately 46% of total nonperforming assets were made up of seven individual nonperforming assets greater than $500 at December 31, 2010. As shown Table 31, total nonperforming assets as a percentage of tangible common equity including the allowance for loan losses (the “Texas Ratio”) were 31.32% at December 31, 2011 compared to 30.61% at December 31, 2010 and 35.04% at December 31, 2009. For the purpose of this measurement, tangible common equity is equal to total common stockholders’ equity less mortgage servicing right assets. Provision for estimated loan losses declined to $1,390 in 2011 from $1,795 in 2010. The provision for loan losses decreased during 2011 compared to 2010 due to a reduction in seriously delinquent nonaccrual loans of $1,065, or 11.8%, during 2011 and identification of fewer new problem loans as the local economy and borrower credit stabilized. However, loss on foreclosed assets increased $348, or 41.0% to $1,197 during 2011 compared to $849 during 2010 from a larger amount of partial write-downs to foreclosed properties. Partial write-downs were $992 during 2011 and $405 during 2010. Total credit costs as represented by the provision for loan losses and loss on foreclosed property was largely unchanged and was $2,587 during 2011 and $2,644 during 2010. 36 Table of Contents Nonperforming loans are reviewed to determine exposure for potential loss within each loan category. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed based on credit quality and other pertinent loan portfolio information. The adequacy of the allowance and the provision for loan losses is consistent with the composition of the loan portfolio and recent internal credit quality assessments. We maintain our headquarters and one branch location in the City of Wausau, Wisconsin, and maintain the majority of our deposits (including five of our eight locations), and loan customers in Marathon County, Wisconsin. During 2011, the Marathon County, Wisconsin unemployment rate declined from 7.1% in December 2010 to 6.5% in December 2011. Late in 2011, two large local manufacturing employers located in Marathon County announced local factory closures which were reported to eliminate approximately 1,000 jobs, a significant amount in our local economy. It is possible the unemployment rate will increase and remain elevated during 2012. The annualized level of loan loss provision during 2012 is expected to be similar to the level recorded during 2011, although loss on foreclosed assets is expected to decline during 2012 compared to the prior year. Future provisions will be impacted by the actual amount of impaired and other problem loans identified by internal procedures or regulatory agencies. In addition, fair value of existing foreclosed assets continue to be reviewed in light of recent local market data and may be subject to a further write-down of value during 2012. Loans are placed on a nonaccrual status when they become contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. All interest accrued but not collected for loans (including applicable impaired loans) that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income. Nonaccrual loans and restructured loans maintained on accrual status remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated. In general, uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated when the borrower has displayed a history of regular loan payments using a market interest rate that is expected to continue as if a typical performing loan. Some borrowers continue to make loan payments while maintained on non-accrual status. We apply all payments received on nonaccrual loans to principal until the loan is returned to accrual status or repaid.

Our allocation methodology focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, the geographic and industry mix of the loan portfolio, and historical losses by category. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio. Management allocates the allowance for loan losses by pools of risk and by loan type. We combine estimates of the allowance needed for loans analyzed individually and loans analyzed on a pool basis. The determination of allocated reserves for larger commercial loans involves a review of individual higher-risk transactions, focused on loan grading, and assessment of projected cash flows and possible resolutions of problem credits. While we use available information to recognize losses on loans, future adjustments may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and future impacts to specific borrowers. 37 Table of Contents The majority of gross loan charge-offs during 2011 were related to six borrowers totaling $1,143, or 72% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge off of $700 related to a line of credit to a building supply company. The majority of gross loan charge-offs during 2010 were related to five borrowers totaling $1,064, or 73% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge-off of $448 related to a nonowner multi-use, multi-tenant commercial real estate development, the majority of which was sold during 2011. During 2009, the majority of gross loan charge-offs were related to four borrowers totaling $1,187, or 73% of all charge-offs, with the largest charge off of $737 related to an out of state syndicated loan participation development project which remains in foreclosed assets at December 31, 2011 and is outlined in Table 17.

This review did not significantly increase or decrease the amount of allowance for loan losses required on the bank wide portfolio compared to our previous method of estimating loss allowances. However, our new method did allocate a greater amount of the reserve to impaired loans. During 2011, we streamlined internal criteria to classify a loan as impaired which now includes all nonaccrual loans, all restructured loans (whether performing or not), and other loans with the potential to become nonaccrual or restructured in the next year. Prior to 2011, impaired loans were generally defined to include larger commercial purpose loans only and did not include all nonaccrual or restructured loans. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the loan loss activity by loan category during 2011 and 2010. Nonperforming loans are defined as loans 90 days or more past due but still accruing, nonaccrual loans, including those defined as impaired under current accounting standards, and restructured loans. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments. Previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed, and future payments received are applied in full to reduce remaining loan principal. No income is accrued or recorded on future payments until the loan is returned to accrual status. Upon return to accrual status, the interest portion of past payments that were applied to reduce nonaccrual principal is taken back into income. The interest that would have been reported in 2011 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $647 in comparison to $124 actually recorded in income. The interest that would have been reported in 2010 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $784 in comparison to $430 actually recorded in income. The interest that would have been reported in 2009 if all such loans had been current throughout the year in accordance with their original terms was approximately $851 in comparison to $557 actually recorded in income. Troubled debt restructured loans (“TDR”) are also included in nonperforming loans. Restructured loans involve the granting of concessions to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan, such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate, or capitalization of unpaid real estate taxes or unpaid interest that the lender would not normally grant. The majority of restructured loans represent conversion of amortizing commercial purpose loans to interest only loans for a temporary period to increase the problem borrower’s cash flow. The remaining restructured loans granted a lower interest rate to borrowers for a temporary period to increase borrower operating cash flow. Such loans are subject to management review and ongoing monitoring and are made in cases where the borrower’s delinquency is considered short-term from circumstances the borrower is believed able to overcome or which would reduce our estimated total credit loss on the relationship. Nonaccrual loans (including nonaccrual restructured loans) remain classified as nonperforming loans until the uncertainty surrounding the credit is eliminated. Therefore, some borrowers continue to make substantially all required payments while maintained on non-accrual status. 38 Table of Contents Substantially all of our residential mortgage loans originated for and held in our loan portfolio were based on conventional and long standing underwriting criteria and are secured by first mortgages on homes in our local markets. We were not an originator of higher risk loans such as option ARM products, high loan-to-value ratio mortgages, interest only loans, subprime loans, or loans with initial teaser rates that can have a greater risk of non-collection than other loans. At December 31, 2011, approximately $2.3 million of loans receivable were 1 – 4 family home equity or junior lien mortgage loans in which the maximum commitment amount of the line of credit plus existing senior liens is greater than 100% of the underlying real estate value, or were a loan in a 3 rd mortgage position or lower, compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2010. Such loans were not originated as part of a program to add higher yielding loans to our portfolio but were loans made on a case by case basis and individually underwritten with the borrower customized to their need. We do not maintain a formal residential mortgage modification program for delinquent residential mortgage borrowers. At December, 31, 2011, the inherent credit loss allocation on non-problem open ended home equity lines of credit was .78% of loan principal compared to .50% during 2010 and 2009 to reflect the risk of future credit losses on such junior lien mortgages from current economic conditions. Nonperforming assets include: (1) loans that are either contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments, on a nonaccrual status, or the terms of which have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal (restructured loans), (2) investment securities in default as to principal or interest, and (3) foreclosed assets. Table 16 presents nonperforming loans and assets by category for the five years ended December 31. Table 16: Nonperforming Loans and Foreclosed Assets As of December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Nonaccrual loans (excluding restructured loans) $ 5,893 $ 7,127 $ 11,829 $ 10,590 $ 3,144 Nonaccrual restructured loans 2,081 1,912 1,469 – – Restructured loans not on nonaccrual 6,220 2,383 – 748 653 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more – – – – – Total nonperforming loans 14,194 11,422 13,298 11,338 3,797 Nonaccrual trust preferred investment security 750 – – – – Foreclosed assets 2,939 4,967 3,776 521 653 Total nonperforming assets $ 17,883 $ 16,389 $ 17,074 $ 11,859 $ 4,450 Impaired loans considered to be performing $ 3,026 $ 6,398 $ 3,774 $ 2,504 $ 1,522 Total nonperforming loans as a percent of gross loans 3.19% 2.60% 2.99% 2.64% 0.97% Total nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets 2.87% 2.64% 2.81% 2.08% 0.83% 2011 compared to 2010 The provision for loan losses was $1,390 in 2011 compared to $1,795 in 2010. Non-performing loans relative to total loans increased significantly from 2.60% at December 31, 2010 to 3.19% at December 31, 2011 due to addition of $3,837 of restructured loans which continue to perform on their restructured terms. However, foreclosed assets decreased from $4,967 at December 31, 2010 to $2,939 at December 31, 2011. Including the trust preferred investment security issued by Johnson Financial Group, total nonperforming assets increased $1,494, or 9.1% to $17,883 at December 31, 2011. After 2010, when the decline in local economic conditions stabilized, the local economy remained slow to recover, which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2011, the unemployment rate was 6.6% in Wisconsin and 6.5% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from 7.1% at December 31, 2010) compared to a rate of 8.5% for the United States. During 2012, we expect restructured loans to increase as we work with problem borrowers to minimize the level of potential future charge-offs and maximize cumulative total principal repayment. In addition, regulatory pressures and a change in generally accepted accounting principles regarding identification of restructured loans are likely to increase loans disclosed as troubled debt restructurings. Although some restructured loans may continue on accrual status, the restructured designation would still increase total nonperforming loans and could increase the provision for loan losses. 39 Table of Contents Approximately 52% of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties greater than $500 at December 31, 2011: Table 17: Largest Nonperforming Assets at December 31, 2011 ($000s) Collateral Description Asset Type Gross Principal Specific Reserves Northern Wisconsin hotel Accrual TDR $ 1,767 $ – Cranberry producing agricultural real estate Accrual TDR 1,578 – Vacation home/recreational properties (three) Foreclosed 1,280 n/a Multi-family rental apartment units and vacant land Accrual TDR 1,240 302 Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate and equipment Accrual TDR 764 47 Johnson Financial Group (WI) Capital Trust III debentures Nonaccrual 750 – Owner occupied multi use, multi-tenant real estate Accrual TDR 688 195 Owner occupied restaurant real estate and business assets Nonaccrual 675 150 Out of area condo land development - loan participation Foreclosed 587 n/a Total listed nonperforming assets $ 9,329 $ 694 Total bank wide nonperforming assets $ 17,883 $ 2,659 Listed assets as a percent of total nonperforming assets 52% 26% Table 18: Largest Performing, but Impaired Loans at December 31, 2011 ($000s) Collateral Description Asset Type Gross Principal Specific Reserves Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate and equipment Impaired $ 790 $ 98 Owner occupied manufacturer real estate & equipment Impaired 615 – Total listed performing, but impaired loans $ 1,405 $ 98 Total performing, but impaired loans $ 3,026 $ 519 Listed assets as a % of total performing, but impaired loans 46% 19% During 2011, we restructured commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a hotel in Northern Wisconsin to change borrower payments from amortizing to interest only due to a decline in revenue. This loan relationship is included in Table 17 as $1,767 of gross principal. This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan is classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan. A collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December 31, 2011. We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout 2012. During 2011, we restructured commercial mortgage loans collateralized by cranberry producing agricultural real estate to change from amortizing payments to interest only payments as the property owner sought to sell the operation or partner with new investors. This loan relationship is included in Table 17 as $1,578 of gross principal. This change was considered a restructuring of troubled debt and the loan was classified as nonperforming although the borrower continues to make required payments and is considered an accrual basis loan. A collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and related cash flow analysis indicates no allowance for loan loss on this credit was required at December 31, 2011. We expect this loan to remain classified as nonperforming throughout 2012 unless the borrower sells the operation to a new investor. During 2009, $3.3 million of foreclosed properties originally related to a $5.8 million land development loan were sold at auction at a loss of $452 excluding a previously expensed $125 auction marketing fee. The remaining $2,477 foreclosed asset was further written down $427 to an estimated fair value of $2,050 at December 31, 2009 for total valuation losses on the property of $1,004 during 2009 when including the marketing fee. During 2010, one of the four remaining individual properties was sold and the entire $283 sale proceeds were applied to reduce cost basis of the remaining properties. During 2011, the remaining properties were further written down an additional $487 due to declining real estate values for this type of vacation property. As shown in Table 17, three properties remain with cost basis of $1,280 at December 31, 2011. During 2011, the northern Wisconsin area where these properties are located experienced few vacation property transactions in excess of $1 million, such as would be appropriate for this foreclosed property. We actively market these remaining properties for sale but cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset. 40 Table of Contents During 2010, we entered into a restructuring agreement on a $1,177 commercial real estate loan with a local developer and owner of multi-family apartment complexes to extend the amortization period on existing debt to increase cash flow available to the developer to meet real estate tax and other obligations. At December 31, 2011, this $1,240 debt as reflected in Table 17 is maintained on accrual status and no reduction in stated interest rate was made in the modification. We obtained a new collateral appraisal during 2011 which indicated the property value has declined. We estimated various scenarios for future borrower payments on this loan including a liquidation scenario in the current environment. Based on our analysis, a $302 allowance for loan losses was maintained against the loan at December 31, 2011. During 2010, we restructured the loan terms on $754 of loan principal to lower the interest rate on existing debt with a borrower in the cabinetry contracting industry to increase cash flow during a large decline in customer sales. During 2011, the borrower sold the business to a competitor but retained a mortgage on the production facility which is leased to the new owner and gave a purchase option within three years to the new business owner. We expect the new owner to exercise the purchase option near the end of the three year term. The remaining $764 principal is maintained on accrual status and reflected in Table 17 at December 31, 2011. Based on projected cash flows to be received from our borrower from rental payments received by the new business owner, we maintained a $47 allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 compared to a loan loss reserve of $75 in the prior year. During 2011, we were informed by Johnson Financial Capital Trust of its intent to defer payment of interest on its 7% trust preferred capital debentures. Johnson Financial Group is the holding company for Johnson Bank, headquartered in Racine, Wisconsin and is the second largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin. Our investment in the $750 debentures was placed on nonaccrual status and no interest income was recorded during 2011. Later in 2011, the family ownership of Johnson Financial Group agreed with regulators to recapitalize the bank with approximately $235 million in equity capital. The new capital is expected to be fully contributed to the bank by 2012. Our internal evaluation has determined this investment is not other than temporarily impaired and no charge against net income for impairment has been recorded. During 2011, we restructured an owner occupied commercial real estate loan with a local insurance agent. The building was constructed during 2008 and included additional space to rent to unrelated service businesses. The debt was restructured to extend the amortization period to support declining borrower cash flow as portions of the building remained vacant. The restructured loan continues to be maintained on accrual status. The $688 loan is reflected in Table 17 at December 31, 2011. We obtained a new collateral appraisal during 2011 which identified that the value of the property had declined. We estimated various cash payment scenarios from the borrower including cash flow in connection with a liquidation and sale under current market conditions. We maintained an allowance for loan losses against this loan of $195 at December 31, 2011. During 2009, we restructured a $613 loan secured by an owner occupied restaurant to increase borrower cash flow and allow the business to continue operating. During 2010, the borrower’s residential mortgage loan was also classified as a nonperforming loan which increased net nonperforming principal by $93 to $706 at December 31, 2010. The loan is maintained on nonaccrual status and all payments received are used to lower the principal balance. During 2011, $31 of payments were received reducing the balance to $675 as shown in Table 17. A new collateral appraisal was obtained during 2011 and various cash flow scenarios were analyzed including liquidation of the collateral under current market conditions. At December 31, 2011 an allowance for loan losses of $150 was maintained against this credit compared to the $100 allowance maintained at December 31, 2010. We cannot predict the final timing or resolution of this problem loan. During 2007, we entered into a syndicated construction loan agreement sold by Bankers’ Bank Madison, Wisconsin, for construction of vacation condos and an adjacent water park near Hollister, Missouri. The construction loan was intended to be repaid by the proceeds from a municipal tax incremental financing debt issue by the local municipality. When the credit markets for such financing dried up, the project was unable to continue and land development work ceased. The loan participants obtained the property in foreclosure during 2009. The original fair value estimate of the completed project was approximately $24 million. At the time of foreclosure, we valued our asset using a new liquidation value appraisal based on our approximately 7% ownership of the project resulting in a cost basis of $792 at December 31, 2010 and 2009. During 2011, a new appraisal identified a further decline in value and the loan was written down an additional $205 to its new cost basis of $587 as reflected in Table 17. At this time, we are unable to determine the final resolution of this property and further write-downs of value could be required during 2012 when updated appraisals are obtained. 2010 compared to 2009 The provision for loan losses was $1,795 in 2010 compared to $3,700 in 2009. Non-performing loans relative to total loans declined slightly and was 2.60% at December 31, 2010 compared to 2.99% at December 31, 2009. However, foreclosed assets increased from $3,776 at December 31, 2009 to $4,967 at December 31, 2010. Therefore, total nonperforming assets were $16,389, or 2.64% of total assets at December 31, 2010 compared to $17,074, or 2.81% of total assets at December 31, 2009. During 2010, the decline in local economic conditions stabilized but at low levels, which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2010, year-end, the unemployment rate was 7.0% in Wisconsin and 7.1% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers and down from 8.9% at December 31, 2009) compared to a rate of 9.1% for the United States. The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked 29 th out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties for December 2010 (from lowest to highest unemployment rate). 41 Table of Contents A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year-end. If impaired loans and related specific reserves (if any) were disregarded, the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans would have been 1.47% at December 31, 2010 and 1.30% at December 31, 2009 as we continued to increase inherent losses on the loan portfolio during 2010 reflecting the uncertainty of ongoing customer credit stress and high delinquency ratios. Approximately 46% of total nonperforming assets were represented by the following aggregate credits or foreclosed properties greater than $500 at December 31, 2010: Table 19: Largest Nonperforming Assets at December 31, 2010 ($000s) Collateral Description Asset Type Gross Principal Specific Reserves Vacation home/recreational properties (aggregate of three) Foreclosed $ 1,767 n/a Nonowner occupied multi use, multi-tenant real estate Foreclosed 1,450 n/a Multi-family rental apartment units and vacant land TDR 1,177 – Building supply inventory and accounts receivable Nonaccrual 823 700 Out of area condo land development – participation Foreclosed 792 n/a Owner occupied cabinetry contractor real estate TDR 754 75 Owner occupied restaurant and business assets Nonaccrual 706 100 Total listed assets $ 7,469 $ 875 Total bank wide nonperforming assets $ 16,389 $ 1,989 Listed assets as a % of total nonperforming assets 46% 44% Activity for non-performing assets held at December 31, 2010 as shown in Table 19 that are still held at December 31, 2011 and reflected in Table 17 was described previously. Non-performing assets at December 31, 2010 that are no longer included as part of our largest nonperforming assets at December 31, 2011 are described below. At December 31, 2009, we held a $3,446 loan secured by commercial real estate collateral located in Weston, Wisconsin, and marketable equity investments shown in Table 19 on which we completed foreclosure during 2010 and charged off $448 of loan principal. Later in 2010, we recorded a further partial write-down of $250 for a remaining cost of $1,450 as shown in Table 19. During 2011, we sold the building and a significant portion of the vacant and recorded a loss on the sale of $183. The remaining foreclosed property consists of vacant land with a $342 balance at December 31, 2011. We actively market this property for sale but at this time are unable to determine the final timing or resolution of this foreclosed asset. We do not expect further significant losses on resolution of the foreclosed asset. During 2009, our borrower in the building supplies industry ceased payments on a $961 loan secured by construction inventory and accounts receivable in part due to uncollected large accounts receivable due to a dispute between our customer and the account payer. During 2010, we collected $138 in payments which were applied to principal which totaled $823 as shown in Table 19. Due to poor collateral position, we reserved $700 against the loan relationship at December 31, 2009 which was maintained at December 31, 2010. After receipt of final payment, during 2011, we charged-off the remaining $700 of the balance due, representing our largest loan charge-off during 2011. 2009 compared to 2008 The provision for loan losses was $3,700 in 2009 compared to $885 in 2008. Non-performing loans relative to total loans continued to increase and was 2.99% at December 31, 2009 compared to 2.64% at December 31, 2008. In addition, foreclosed assets increased from $521 at December 31, 2008 to $3,776 at December 31, 2009. Therefore, total nonperforming assets were $17,074, or 2.81% of total assets at December 31, 2009 compared to $11,859, or 2.08% of total assets at December 31, 2008. Non-performing loans increased primarily from declining general and local economic conditions which impacted borrower ability to repay according to the loan terms. At December 31, 2009, the unemployment rate was 8.3% in Wisconsin and 8.9% in Marathon County (the home of the majority of our borrowers) compared to a rate of 9.7% for the United States. The Marathon County unemployment rate ranked 39 th out of Wisconsin’s 72 counties for December 2009. A significant portion of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was related to specifically identified impaired loans at year-end. If impaired loans and related specific reserves (if any) were disregarded, the allowance for loan losses to unimpaired loans would have been 1.30% at December 31, 2009 and 1.18% at December 31, 2008 as we increased inherent losses on the loan portfolio during 2009 reflecting the ongoing stress and rising delinquency ratios. 42 Table of Contents Noninterest Income Table 20 presents a common size income statement showing the changing mix of income and expense relative to traditional loan and deposit product net interest income (before tax adjustment) for the five years ending December 31, 2011. This analysis highlights the reliance on, or diversification of, noninterest or fee income to net interest income.

Table 21: Noninterest Income 2011 2010 2009 % of pre-tax % of pre-tax % of pre-tax Years Ended December 31, Amount Income Amount Income Amount income Service fees $ 1,632 21.12 % $ 1,786 26.49 % $ 1,448 36.22 % Mortgage banking income 1,373 17.77 % 1,472 21.83 % 1,850 46.27 % Merchant and debit card fee income 722 9.35 % 731 10.84 % 616 15.41 % Retail investment sales commissions 603 7.81 % 609 9.03 % 388 9.70 % Other operating income 517 6.69 % 357 5.31 % 250 6.26 % Increase in cash surrender value of life insurance 415 5.37 % 410 6.08 % 411 10.28 % Net gain (loss) on write-down and sale of securities 32 0.41 % (20 ) -0.30 % 521 13.03 % Insurance annuity sales commissions 28 0.36 % 24 0.36 % 68 1.70 % Gain (loss) on sale of premises and equipment 15 0.20 % (6 ) -0.09 % (98 ) -2.45 % Gain on sale of non-mortgage loans – 0.00 % – 0.00 % 122 3.05 % Total noninterest income $ 5,337 69.08 % $ 5,363 79.55 % $ 5,576 139.47 % 2011 compared to 2010 Total noninterest income during 2011 was $5,337 compared to $5,363 in 2010, a decrease of $26, or 0.5%. During 2011, service fees declined $154, or 8.6%, due to lower customer usage of our courtesy overdraft program (and related overdraft fees) in response to new regulation concerning this product effective in August 2010. The new regulation requires that certain payments by consumers who did not opt into the bank’s overdraft program are not paid by the bank, reducing overdraft fee income. In addition, the new regulation and negative publicity concerning banks and their overdraft protection programs continue to lower customer usage of the product and we could see further service fee income declines during 2012 related to overdrafts. In addition, mortgage banking income declined $99, or 6.7% as residential mortgage rates began to settle at historically low levels during 2011. Offsetting these declines was commission income on sale of fixed interest rate swaps to commercial adjustable rate loan customers of $207 during 2011. The swap product was a new product during 2011 and is included in other operating income in Table 21 above. Certain commercial customers with adjustable rate loans with us may choose to enter into an interest rate swap with us to convert their floating rate interest payments to a fixed rate. We simultaneously sell these fixed rate hedge contracts to a correspondent bank in exchange for a fee. 43 Table of Contents During 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act related to debit card interchange income, often referred to as the “Durbin Amendment.” These new changes cap the amount of debit card interchange income that may be collected by large banks from merchants for processing card activity. While the new rules technically do not apply to us as a smaller bank, the impacts are expected to become uniform for the industry over time as merchants use their new authority and options to process customer card activity across a wider number of providers. While the timing is uncertain, these fully implemented changes could lower our annualized debit card interchange revenue by approximately $234, down approximately 36% from revenue levels prior to the regulatory change. In general, the banking industry has begun to respond to lower debit card fee revenue by reducing customer account reward programs and related costs and increasing account service fees. We continue to investigate the nature and timing of potential future retail checking account changes in response to the expected reduction of debit card income. Many important sources of noninterest income are impacted by recent and coming federal regulation, including overdraft service fee income and debit card income as noted previously. In addition, the prolonged period of declining residential mortgage rates is gradually lowering the level of mortgage refinanced activity. In addition, we discontinued selling the Rewards Checking NOW product during 2011 which rewarded customers for higher levels of debit card activity. We expect lower usage of debit cards due to this change. Because we expect overdraft income, debit card income, and mortgage income to decline during 2012, we expect total noninterest income to decline during 2012 compared to 2011. 2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, total noninterest income declined $213, or 3.8%, to $5,363 compared to $5,576 during 2009. However, excluding nonrecurring net gains (losses) on security sales, 2010 noninterest income increased $328, or 6.5% compared to 2009. Although 2010 mortgage banking income declined $378 as more borrowers refinanced their residential mortgages when rates fell significantly during 2009 compared to 2010, several other types of income experienced significant increases. For example, service charge income increased $338, or 23.3%, from higher overdraft fee income, and investment and insurance sales commissions increased $221, or 57.0%, from higher gross sales activity. Prior to new regulation which lowered overdraft activity, the bank had rolled out an updated courtesy overdraft product early in 2010 which increased year over year overdraft income and service fee income despite the regulatory change. Lastly, interchange income from credit and debit cards increased $115, or 18.7% during 2010 compared to 2009. Many of the increases in 2010 were in areas expected to be impacted by continued regulatory changes including overdraft fees and card interchange income. Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in 2010 due to increased Rewards Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account. We discontinued selling the Rewards Checking account to new customers in 2011 which is likely to decrease debit card interchange income in future years. New consumer banking regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve concerning customer overdraft programs went into effect during August 2010. The new regulation prevents banks from assessing an overdraft fee related to a transaction conducted at a point of sale such as those using a debit card unless the consumer has specifically “opted into” the program. From the effective date of the regulation to the end of 2010, we experienced an approximately 18% reduction in gross overdraft activity compared to activity prior to the regulatory change. Prior to 2009, bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance. However, limited further investments in this asset class are expected. 2009 compared to 2008 Noninterest income excluding gain (loss) on sale of securities increased 21% during 2009 from a record year of mortgage banking income totaling $1,850 (up 78% over 2008) as customers refinanced their long-term fixed rate residential mortgages. Residential loan principal sold to the secondary market during 2009 was approximately 2.3 times and 3.9 times the levels seen during 2008 and 2007, respectively. This activity was promoted by historically low long-term mortgage rates. During 2009, total noninterest income was $5,576 compared to $3,184 during 2008, an increase of $2,392, or 75.1%. The most significant components of the change include a gain on sale of securities of $521 as well as increased 2009 mortgage banking income of $810 in addition to a loss on FNMA stock of $991 incurred during 2008. Excluding these special items, noninterest income would have increased $70, or 2.2% during 2009. United States Treasury programs and open market mortgage related asset purchases by the Federal Reserve during 2009 dramatically lowered long-term residential mortgage rates, contributing to a wave of mortgage refinancing during 2009. Our mortgage banking income was $1,850 during 2009 compared to $1,040, an increase of $810. During 2009, our mortgage loan portfolio serviced for others increased 28% reaching $237.8 million at December 31, 2009. The components of mortgage banking income may be found in Item 8, Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Merchant and debit card fee interchange income continued to increase in 2009 due to increased Reward Checking NOW balances which required substantial debit card use to earn the premium interest rate on the account. Prior to 2009, bank owned life insurance was purchased on certain employees in connection with officer compensation programs which increased income from cash surrender value of life insurance during 2009 and 2008. 44 Table of Contents Noninterest Expense Table 22 outlines the components of noninterest expenses for the three years ending December 31, 2011. Table 22: Noninterest Expense Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 % of net % of net % of net margin & margin & margin & Amount other income* Amount other income* Amount other income* Wages, except incentive compensation $ 6,121 23.88 % $ 6,207 24.56 % $ 5,991 25.62 % Health and dental insurance 852 3.32 % 941 3.72 % 882 3.77 % Incentive compensation 589 2.30 % 610 2.41 % 378 1.62 % Payroll taxes and other employee benefits 587 2.29 % 613 2.44 % 553 2.38 % Profit sharing and retirement plan expense 470 1.83 % 446 1.76 % 274 1.17 % Deferred compensation plan expense 136 0.53 % 125 0.49 % 77 0.33 % Restricted stock plan vesting expense 78 0.30 % 43 0.17 % 25 0.11 % Deferred loan origination costs (496 ) -1.93 % (518 ) -2.05 % (708 ) -3.03 % Total salaries and employee benefits 8,337 32.52 % 8,467 33.50 % 7,452 31.88 % Occupancy expense 1,702 6.64 % 1,863 7.37 % 1,822 7.79 % Data processing other office operations 1,382 5.39 % 1,174 4.65 % 957 4.09 % Loss on foreclosed assets 1,197 4.67 % 849 3.36 % 1,130 4.83 % FDIC insurance expense 505 1.97 % 782 3.09 % 986 4.22 % Directors fees and benefits 367 1.43 % 295 1.17 % 262 1.12 % Legal and professional expenses 333 1.30 % 339 1.34 % 322 1.38 % Advertising and promotion 291 1.14 % 355 1.40 % 355 1.52 % Debit card and deposit losses 136 0.53 % 356 1.41 % 166 0.50 % Other expenses 1,528 5.96 % 1,445 5.72 % 1,543 6.59 % Total noninterest expense $ 15,778 61.55 % $ 15,925 63.01 % $ 14,829 63.42 % * Net interest income (net margin) is calculated on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate of 34%. 2011 compared to 2010 During 2011, total noninterest expenses were $15,778 compared to $15,925 during 2010, a decrease of $147, or 0.9%. However, operating expenses before foreclosure costs would have declined $495, or 3.3%, during 2011 compared to 2010 with $277 of the decline coming from lower FDIC insurance premiums and $220 of the decline coming from lower debit card and deposit losses. Dodd-Frank legislation effective during 2011 changed the method in which deposit insurance premiums are calculated. Premium levels are now assessed based on net assets after deducting Tier 1 regulatory capital rather than being assessed based on the level of deposits held. The effect of this change was to transfer a greater portion of total industry deposit insurance premiums to the nation’s largest banks as they typically maintain a lower percentage of deposits to assets compared to smaller banks like us. Debit card losses were higher in 2010 due to sustaining a net $110 loss from a concentrated fraud involving certain of our customer accounts. Salaries and employee benefits declined $130, or 1.5%, from $8,467 in 2010 to $8,337 in 2011 due primarily to an $89 decrease (9.5%) in health and dental insurance expense. During 2011, data processing expenses increased $208, or 17.7%, compared to 2010 due to outsourced data processing costs associated with the new computer system placed in service during June 2010. However, occupancy and facilities expense declined $161 during 2011 in part from lower computer equipment depreciation expense previously incurred with the prior in-house computer system and categorized as occupancy expenses. During 2012, data processing expense is expected to increase at a rate similar to that seen during 2011 as we experience a full year of regular contract charges. Following the June 2010 conversion, we had enjoyed discounted monthly vendor charges to help offset conversion related costs incurred during the first year of using the new system. During 2012, wages and benefits are expected to increase minimally with average base pay increases of 2.5% granted January 1, 2012 compared to average base pay increases of 2.7% granted for 2011. Although less than seen during 2010, employee incentive costs remained historically high as 2011 net income exceeded the target. Depending on net income growth during 2012, such increased incentives may not recur, potentially reducing employee costs. For example, if our 2012 net income was the same as in 2011, incentive costs could decline 25% to 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. Health and dental insurance costs are incurred under a self insured plan subject to a maximum stop loss. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. We expect 2012 health and dental costs to increase closer to levels experienced during 2010. 45 Table of Contents Foreclosed asset expense is expected to decline during 2012 due to lower levels of partial charge-offs of foreclosed properties as local real estate values stabilize. Partial charge-offs of foreclosed property from value declines were $992 in 2011 compared to $405 during 2010 and $477 during 2009. In addition we expect to experience lower 2012 holding costs as the remaining investment in foreclosed assets remains near current levels, which is significantly lower than seen during 2010. Changes to FDIC insurance assessment methods as part of the Dodd-Frank legislation are expected to keep our FDIC insurance premium expense during 2012 similar to 2011 levels. However, the FDIC insurance rate is subject to the level of industry wide bank closures and related deposit insurance fund losses which is unpredictable and could be greater in future years than seen during 2011. Although not expected during 2012, accelerated or unexpected levels of bank failures within the industry could cause the FDIC to increase premiums or collect special assessments to make up insurance fund shortfalls. Lastly, our specific insurance rating is dictated in large part by results of our annual regulatory exam. While not expected, negative regulatory exam results could significantly increase our FDIC insurance premium expense. During 2012, advertising and promotional expense is expected to increase modestly as we roll out a new retail checking account line up. Taken together, noninterest expense excluding foreclosed property write-downs and gains and losses on sales of properties is expected to increase by an inflationary amount during 2012. 2010 compared to 2009 During 2010, total noninterest expenses were $15,925 compared to $14,829 in 2009, an increase of $1,096, or 7.4%. The majority of the increase was in the form of higher salaries and employee benefits which increased $1,015, or 13.6% during 2010. Base wages represented $215 of the increase, growing 3.6% over 2009 with increased overtime pay representing $59 of the increase related to the June 2010 quarter core processing system conversion. Excluding overtime pay, base wages increased 2.6% during 2010. Other factors included fewer deferred direct loan origination costs of $190, increased health and dental insurance plan expense of $59, and higher year-end incentive and discretionary profit sharing plan allocations of $404, up 62%, based on exceeding 2010 net income targets. FDIC insurance expense declined $204, or 20.6% during 2010 compared to 2009 due to the prior year including a special FDIC insurance assessment totaling $264. Prior to the special assessment, 2010 FDIC insurance expense increased $60, or 8.3%. Offsetting the 2010 decline in FDIC expense was an increase in data processing and other office operations expense of $217, or 22.7%, due to a change in core processing computer system during June 2010 from an internally maintained system to an outsourced vendor system. Following the June 2010 conversion date, the system vendor provided a contractual reduction in monthly service fees that expired during 2011. The new system, while increasing data processing costs, provides significant operating efficiencies and capacity for customer and product growth compared to the prior system maintained in house since 1997. The prior in house data processing system recognized a significant portion of the cost as elements of depreciation expense, reflected as occupancy expense, while software maintenance charges were reflected as data processing costs. During 2010, we incurred a $110 loss related to debit card fraud, net of insurance reimbursements, that resulted from a coordinated external fraud targeting us and our debit card customers. Even excluding this individual loss, debit card losses of $57 were significantly higher than seen during 2009. Along with debit card losses, deposit losses increased from $96 during 2009 to $180 during 2010 as we increased the benefit limit of our courtesy overdraft program. The increased deposit losses on the courtesy overdraft program during 2010 were approximately 22% of the increased 2010 overdraft fee income. 2009 compared to 2008 Noninterest expenses totaled $14,829 during 2009 quarter compared to $12,566 during 2008, an increase of $2,263, or 18.0%. During 2009, loss on foreclosed assets increased $1,124 compared to 2008 to a total of $1,130 from a $1,004 loss on a large land development foreclosure partially sold at auction and $126 in foreclosure costs related to all other properties. In addition, the FDIC increased regular quarterly insurance premiums and charged a onetime special assessment during 2009 to recapitalize the FDIC insurance fund in light of ongoing and expected bank failures. During 2009, our FDIC insurance expense was $986 compared to $284 during 2008, an increase of $702. During December 2009, we prepaid $2.6 million to the FDIC representing estimated insurance premiums during 2010 through 2012 as required by the FDIC. This prepayment is amortized as FDIC insurance expense based on assessment rates then in effect as measured on a quarterly basis. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $608, or 8.9% during 2009 primarily from base wage increases and a slightly larger employee base (together representing $379 of increased expense). Incentive and profit sharing payments related to loan fees, deposit growth, mortgage banking, and return on equity performance to banking peer group increased $163, or 33% during 2009 compared to 2008. An increase in health insurance expense of $54, or 6.5%, during 2009 compared to 2008 made up the remainder of increased salaries and benefits expense. 46 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 31.3% during 2011 compared to 29.5% in 2010 and 22.1% in 2009. The 2011 and 2010 effective rates increased as the percentage of tax-exempt income from securities and bank owned life insurance declined relative to total pre-tax income. Tax-exempt interest on securities and bank-owned life insurance reduced tax expense by $621 in 2011, $666 in 2010, and $697 during 2009. These reductions represented 23.6%, 29.1%, and 51.3% of tax expense at the statutory tax rate during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The reductions have come from higher levels of pretax income during 2011 and 2010 combined with lower tax exempt yields on municipal securities and life insurance as long-term rates declined in the overall market. Refer to Item 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax information. Due to declining average reinvestment rates on tax-exempt municipal securities, we expect the effective tax rate to increase slightly during 2012 compared to 2011. The 2009 effective tax rate increased over 2008 from a change in State of Wisconsin income tax law to a combined reporting model. This change subjected investment income earned on investment securities held by PSB Investments, Inc., Peoples State Bank’s investment subsidiary, to state income taxes. Previously, income on these investments was not subject to Wisconsin income taxes. This change in taxation method increased our provision for income taxes by $162 during 2009 compared to 2008. The 2009 effective tax rate would have been 18.0% without the state tax regulation change. Critical Accounting Policies Allowance for Loan Losses As noted previously, during the quarter ended March 31, 2011, we changed our methodology to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. The changes were made in response to several regulatory and industry factors including greater transparency in allowance and loss activity by loan segment and class, greater reliance on various external and internal factors to determine contingency reserves on loans not considered to be impaired, and greater reliance on estimates of future cash flows on impaired loans to estimate required allowances with lesser reliance on impaired loan collateral fair value to determine required allowances. Current accounting standards call for the allowance for loan losses to include both specific losses on identified impaired problem loans and inherent contingent losses on existing loan pools not yet considered problem loans. Determination of the allowance for loan losses at period-end is based primarily on subjective factors and management assessment of risk in the existing portfolio. Actual results, if significantly different from those using estimates at period-end, could have a material impact on the results of operations. For example, losses incurred on loans not previously identified as carrying significant loss potential would increase the provision for loan losses expense equal to the amount of the loan principal charged off. Refer to Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on allocation of the allowance for loan losses between different credit risk categories and for impaired loans as well as our system to review changes in credit risk on individual loans. Loans receivable, for the purpose of estimating the allowance for loan losses, are separated into 12 loan categories: Performing loans (5 categories, all of which are assigned inherent loss reserves): Residential mortgages Home equity lines of credit Consumer and individual loans Commercial real estate loans – credit risk grades 1 (“high quality”) through grade 4 (“acceptable risk”) Commercial and industrial loans – grades 1 through 4 Problem loans assigned inherent loss reserves (4 categories): Commercial real estate loans – grade 5 (“watch”) and grade 6 (“substandard”) loans Commercial and industrial loans – grade 5 (“watch”) and grade 6 (“substandard”) loans Impaired loans assigned specific reserves (3 categories): Commercial real estate loans - grade 7 (“impaired”) Commercial and industrial loans – grade 7 (“impaired”) Residential mortgage, consumer, and other personal loans – grade 7 (“impaired”) Commercial purpose loans are subcategorized into the credit risk “grades” based on an internal determination of risk established during credit analysis and updated no less than annually. Determination of risk grades takes into account several factors including collateral, cash flow, borrower’s industry environment, financial statement strength, and other factors. Identified impaired problem loans under current accounting standards are classified into the lowest quality risk grade (grade 7). Impaired loans include nonaccrual loans, loans identified as restructurings of troubled debt, and loans accruing interest with elevated risk of default in the near term based on a variety of credit factors. 47 Table of Contents Inherent loss reserves are assigned as a percentage of estimated loss on principal within each category and are based on the following historical and subjective factors: Weighted average historical net charge-off of principal by category during the past 12 quarters. Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of external factors including: changes in economic conditions, changes in nature/volume of portfolio, changes in collateral values, changes in regulatory requirements, and changes in peer data. Additional contingency reserves based on subjective assessment of internal factors including: changes in bank policies, changes in underwriting criteria, changes in volume of past due loans, changes in internal local review processes, and management turnover. Inherent loss reserves for loans categories graded 5 (watch) and grade 6 (substandard) are provided additional contingency reserves beyond those described above to reflect the emerging credit risk represented by loans within these categories. These additional contingency reserves are based on the average specific reserves calculated for impaired loans by category at period end. Grade 5 (watch ) loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to 25% of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category. Grade 6 (substandard) loans are assigned an additional contingency reserve equal to 50% of the average reserve allocation assigned to impaired loans within that loan category. Specific reserves are calculated on each individual borrower by estimating future cash flows associated with borrower payments and foreclosure value of collateral associated with the loan. Cash flows expected from foreclosure of collateral are discounted for closing costs and based on estimated current collateral and property values. Estimated cash flows are discounted by the loan contract rate to determine the present value of future cash flows. For loans considered to be restructurings of trouble debt, the cash flows are discounted using the loan contract rate in place prior to any loan modifications. Loans considered collateral dependent are assigned reserves based on the net cash value of collateral without consideration of discounted estimated cash flows. After calculating the estimate of required allowances for loan losses using the steps above, a further subjective analysis of current and projected economic conditions, problem loan trends, and other factors may cause additional unallocated reserves to be recorded to reflect this additional risk of loss before it is recognized by the change in commercial credit risk grades, or the increase in the historical inherent loss percentage assigned to loan categories. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, no unallocated loan loss allowances were recorded. Estimates of inherent losses on non-problem loans are a significant accounting estimate due to the many economic and subjective factors involved in estimating future losses based on existing negative factors associated with unidentified future problem loans currently making payments. Reliance on historical charge off activity and subjective factors related to external and internal factors is expected to increase volatility in allowance for loan losses, which could increase volatility in quarterly net income as conditions change and increase or decrease the existing allowance for loan losses. For example, if the actual inherent losses on the five performing loan categories evaluated using inherent loss estimates as described above were 25% greater than those currently applied to meet reserve needs, the December 31, 2011 allowance for loan losses would have increased $843 (10.6%) and have decreased 2011 net income by approximately $511 after income taxes. In addition, an unexpected downgrade of loans classified grade 5 (watch) and grade 6 (substandard) to impaired status could significantly increase total allowance for loan losses as those downgraded loans are allocated allowances based on projected cash flow or collateral values on an individualized basis. For example, at December 31, 2011, if all of the loans graded 6 (substandard) and 50% of loan principal graded 5 (watch) were reclassified as impaired loans and experienced the average loss allocation currently reflected in the impaired loan portfolio, the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2011 would have increased $1,215 (15.3%) and decreased 2011 net income by approximately $736 after income taxes. Mortgage Servicing Rights As required by current accounting standards, we record a mortgage servicing right asset (“MSR”) when we continue to service borrower payments and perform maintenance activities in exchange for an annual servicing fee of .25% of average serviced mortgage principal on loans in which the principal has been sold to the FHLB or other secondary market investors. Our initial value of servicing rights is calculated on an individual loan level basis and uses public financial market information for many of the significant estimates. In the period in which the principal is sold to the secondary market investors, we increase the gain on sale of the loan by the value of the initial MSR. If the actual value was less than we recorded, such as if the estimated future servicing period or average serviced principal was less than estimated, the gain recorded on origination of the MSR would be overstated. Recognition of impairment of excess mortgage servicing rights would decrease income, causing our accounting for mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy. For example, if the actual value of initial MSR on 2011 secondary market sales were 25% less than that recorded, gain on sale of loans (a component of mortgage banking income) during 2011 would have declined approximately $105 before income taxes. In addition, if the actual value of the entire December 31, 2011 MSR were 25% less than recorded, net servicing revenue (a component of mortgage banking income) would have declined approximately $301 before income taxes. 48 Table of Contents We make the following estimates and perform the following procedures when accounting for MSRs: 1. Serviced loans are stratified by risk of prepayment criteria. Currently, strata are first based on the year in which the loan was originated, then on term, and then on the range of interest rates within that term. 2. We use a discount approach to generate the initial value for the OMSR. The calculation takes the average of the current dealer consensus on prepayment speeds as reported by Andrew Davidson & Company or the prepayment speed implied in the mortgage backed security prices for newly created loans along with other assumptions to generate an estimate of future cash flows. The present value of estimated cash flows equals the fair value of the OMSR. We capitalize the lower of fair value or cost of the OMSR. Refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for significant fair value and cost estimates other than the estimate of public dealer consensus of prepayment speeds. Changes in these estimates and assumptions would change the initial value recorded for OMSRs and change the gain on sale of mortgage loans recorded in the income statement. 3. Amortization of the OMSR is calculated based on actual payment activity on a per loan basis. Because all loans are handled individually, curtailments decrease MSRs as well as regularly scheduled payments. The loan servicing value is amortized on a level yield basis. 4. Significant declines in current market mortgage interest rates decrease the fair value of existing MSRs due to the increase in anticipated prepayments above the original assumed speed. Accounting standards require that impairment testing be performed and that MSRs be recorded at the lower of fair value or amortized cost. We perform quarterly impairment testing on our MSRs. Actual prepayment speeds (based on our actual customer activity on a loan level basis) are compared to the assumed prepayment speed on the date of the last quarterly impairment testing (or the origination prepayment speed if a recently originated loan). The fair value assumptions other than prepayment speed are combined with the new estimated prepayment speed to create a new fair value. An impairment allowance is recorded for any shortfall between the new fair value and the original cost after adjusting for past amortization and curtailments. LIQUIDITY Because total assets increased just $1,774, or 0.3% during 2011, the $14,872 increase in core deposits (up 4.3%) was used to pay down other borrowings by $11,820 during 2011 while wholesale borrowings increased $425. During 2010, the majority of the $14,239 in asset growth was funded by an increase in retail and local deposits of $16,890 (up 4.4%). During 2009, local deposits increased $18,584 (5.1%) and brokered certificates increased $12,346 (19.0%) to fund net loan growth of $22,355 and repayment $6,841 of FHLB advances. 49 Table of Contents Wholesale funding includes FHLB advances, brokered and national certificates of deposits, wholesale repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased. These sources of wholesale funding are limited by the wholesale lender’s ability to raise individual depositor funds, our regulatory capital classification, our ability to generate positive earnings performance, our sources of collateral acceptable to the wholesale lender, by our internal policy limitations on aggregate exposure to use of such funds, and in the case of the FHLB, our level of FHLB capital stock relative to our aggregate amount of FHLB advances. Table 23 summarizes the sources and uses of cash for the three years ending December 31, 2011. Table 23: Summary Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Cash flows from operating activities $ 9,657 $ 8,719 $ 3,664 Payment of dividends to shareholders and purchase of treasury stock (1,168 ) (1,128 ) (1,096 ) Operating cash flow retained by PSB 8,489 7,591 2,568 Net funds received from retail and local depositors 8,517 16,890 18,584 Net funds received from wholesale depositors 7,735 – 12,346 Net proceeds from additional FHLB advances – – – Net proceeds from other borrowings – 3,101 2,779 Funds from issuance of senior subordinated notes – – 7,000 Proceeds from additional capital received from shareholders 45 – – Cash flow retained from operations and financing before debt repayment 24,786 27,582 43,277 Net funds paid to retail and local depositors – – – Net funds paid to wholesale depositors – (10,364 ) – Net repayment of FHLB advances (7,310 ) (725 ) (6,841 ) Net repayment of other borrowings, net (11,820 ) – – Cash flow retained from operations and financing after debt repayment 5,656 16,493 36,436 Funds received from sale and maturities of investment securities, net 21,347 26,757 34,591 Net funds received from customer repayment of loans receivable – 1,496 – Proceeds from sale of nonmonetary assets 1,002 897 1,578 Cash flow available for investing activities 28,005 45,643 72,605 Net funds loaned to customers (7,130 ) – (22,355 ) Net funds invested in securities (22,718 ) (28,151 ) (36,722 ) Purchase of bank certificates of deposit – (2,484 ) – Purchase of FHLB capital stock – – – Funds used to purchase bank-owned life insurance (92 ) – (109 ) Capital expenditures (191 ) (1,014 ) (254 ) Cash flow used in investing activities (30,131 ) (31,649 ) (59,440 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents held at beginning of year $ (2,126 ) $ 13,994 $ 13,165 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 40,331 26,337 13,172 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 38,205 $ 40,331 $ 26,337 50 Table of Contents Deposits Core retail deposits are our largest source of funds. We consider core retail deposits to include noninterest-bearing demand deposits, interest bearing demand and savings deposits, money market demand deposits, and retail time deposits less than $100. Core retail deposits represented 57.9% and 55.7% of total assets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In addition to core certificates of deposit, funding from local certificates with balances greater than $100 made up 7.4% and 8.4% of total assets at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Despite being held by local customers, these large certificates are not considered core funds as the balances may be temporary and subject to placement with any financial institution offering the highest interest rate bid. Our retail deposit growth is continuously influenced by competitive pressure from other financial institutions, as well as other investment opportunities available to customers. Table 24 outlines the average distribution of deposits during the three years ending December 31, 2011. Table 24: Average Deposits Distribution 2011 2010 2009 Interest Interest Interest Year Ended December 31, Amount Rate paid Amount Rate paid Amount Rate paid Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 57,942 n/a $ 55,848 n/a $ 54,738 n/a Interest-bearing demand and savings deposits 126,944 0.87 % 113,086 1.14 % 101,536 1.37 % Wholesale interest-bearing demand deposits – 0.00 % 7,470 0.32 % 3,789 0.37 % Money market demand deposits 100,089 0.81 % 95,329 1.14 % 75,039 1.32 % Retail and local time deposits 97,042 1.76 % 113,066 2.17 % 123,412 3.15 % Wholesale time deposits 74,158 2.43 % 71,421 2.97 % 76,452 3.17 % Totals $ 456,175 1.19 % $ 456,220 1.53 % $ 434,966 2.00 % Average retail deposit growth 1.24 % 6.37 % 3.57 % Average total deposit growth -0.01 % 4.89 % 7.09 % We hold retail and local time deposits collected under the “Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System” (CDARS), a nation-wide program in which network banks work together to obtain greater FDIC insurance on deposits through sharing of banking charters. Such deposits are typically greater than $100 in balance and average balances of CDARS deposits were $16,384 during 2011, $21,409 during 2010, and $14,795 during 2009. Average 2011 CDARS balances declined as local municipalities that fueled 2010 growth seeking 100% FDIC protection withdraw balances for operational needs as well as to invest in other deposit products outside the CDARS program. For regulatory purposes, these deposits are considered brokered deposits and disclosed as such on quarterly regulatory filings. However, for internal and external reporting other than for Call Report purposes, these deposits are considered to be retail deposits since the terms of the account are set directly between us and our local customer on a retail basis. Accordingly, these deposits are included as “Retail time deposits $100 and over” in the Tables in this section. Total CDARS deposits totaled $11,825 and $19,618 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Originally available under the TARP legislation passed by the federal government during 2008 and now required under the provisions of Dodd-Frank, we participated in the FDIC program, which provided unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest bearing deposits in excess of $250 through December 31, 2012. Although our individual costs of this program beginning in 2011 are not separately stated by the FDIC, additional FDIC insurance fees to participate in this program were approximately $22 and $24 during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 51 Table of Contents Table 25 provides a breakdown of deposit categories as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

An increase in commercial noninterest-bearing checking of $15,197, or 40.9% led the increase. However, this increase was largely from year-end seasonal deposits that were withdrawn by customers early in 2012. Rewards Checking, a high yield retail NOW account that was the primary driver of deposit growth since 2007 declined $2,609, or 5.2%, to $47,578 at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010. We discontinued sale of Rewards Checking during 2011 and modified the account structure to reduce cost in response to very low short-term national rates and an anticipated decline in debit card interchange income. Retail time deposits less $100 declined $5,340, or 10.5%, during 2011 as rates paid on certificates of deposit in the current market approached those paid on money market and NOW accounts. Therefore, customers appeared to move funds out of time deposits into nonmaturity accounts that allowed them to access the funds without penalty such as when deposited into a time deposit. Nonmaturity money market and NOW accounts increased $2,846 during 2011. 52 Table of Contents Rewards Checking was the primary driver of increased deposit growth since its introduction in June 2007 through December 2010. During this period, Rewards Checking supplied approximately 64% of our net core deposit growth. During 2011, we grandfathered existing Rewards Checking customers but discontinued selling the product. Rewards Checking operated as a traditional interest bearing checking account but paid a premium interest rate and reimbursement of foreign ATM fees if the customer meet certain account usage requirements. In general, the account required customers to use their debit card at least 10 times per month, deposit their employer paycheck via ACH, and receive their periodic checking account statement via email from our home banking website. The premium rewards annual percentage yield (“APY”) paid was 2.29% and 3.01% on the first $25 of balances at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the premium rate paid was 2.01% on the first $15 of deposit balances. The Rewards Checking interest rate is adjustable at our discretion, but was intended to provide the highest potential retail deposit rate product available to customers. The debit card usage requirement substantially increased the amount of debit card interchange income through 2010 as described previously under the section titled “Noninterest income”. Prior to 2011, the incremental “all-in” cost of Rewards Checking deposits was less than wholesale funding alternatives and was believed to be a long-term cost effective source of funds in addition to providing PSB with a competitive advantage in the retail banking environment and greater control over the repricing of local deposits in a rising rate environment. Rewards Checking balances were $47,578 and $50,187 at December 31, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The average interest cost of Rewards Checking balances (excluding debit card interchange fees, savings from delivery of electronic periodic statements and vendor software costs of maintaining the program) was 1.59% in 2011 compared to 2.10% in 2010 and 2.80% in 2009. Average balances in Rewards Checking are expected to remain between $40 million and $45 million during 2012. Changes to debit card interchange income contained in Dodd-Frank and proposed by the Federal Reserve were anticipated to have a dramatic impact to the profitability of Rewards Checking. We are currently evaluating other product options attractive to our customers that meet market needs and minimize our operating expenses and servicing costs in light of reduced interchange income. These products could replace Rewards Checking or be priced in a manner more attractive than Rewards Checking in light of the potential decrease to debit card interchange income. Because Rewards Checking deposit growth has been the significant driver of local deposit growth in past years, changes to this account structure could reduce future deposit growth. Although government deposits grew significantly during 2009 from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account, nonmaturity government balances continued a decline of $8,662, or 21.2%, to $32,145 at December 31, 2011, after a decline of $2,890, or 6.6%, to $40,807 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. As loan growth slowed significantly during 2010, we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances. We held $35.3 million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts from our ten largest deposit customers, making up approximately 9% of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December 31, 2011. Many of the balances at year-end were seasonal deposits and expected to be withdrawn during the first several months of 2012. In light of the seasonal nature of many large accounts at year-end and expected low organic loan growth during 2012, we expect small increases to local deposit growth in our existing markets during 2012. 2010 compared to 2009 Local core deposits increased $16,186, up 4.9%, at December 31, 2010 compared December 31, 2009. An increase in commercial money market funds of $13,258, or 42.5%, led the increase in deposits. The increase of $9,989, or 24.9%, in Rewards Checking balances supported a decline in core certificates of deposit of $8,523, or 14.3% during the year. The premium rewards annual percentage yield (“APY”) paid was 2.29% and 3.01% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Rewards Checking balances were $50,187 and $40,198 at December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Commercial money market balances increased in part from a significant new account opened by a related party during the December 2010 quarter which increased money market deposits by $7,167 at December 31, 2010. These funds were seasonal and declined early in 2011. Government deposits grew significantly during 2009 from introduction of an unsecured high yield money market account but declined $2,890, or 6.6%, to $40,807 at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. As loan growth slowed significantly during 2010, we reduced the high yield rate paid on the government money market account which led to the decrease in balances. If a new overnight repurchase agreement account opened in 2010 were also included, we held $49.8 million of total nonmaturity deposits and overnight repurchase amounts form the ten largest customers, making up approximately 12% of our total local deposits and overnight repurchase agreements at December 31, 2010. Many of the balances at year-end were seasonal deposits and were withdrawn during the first several months of 2011. Wholesale Funding Sources and Available Liquidity Our asset-liability management process provides a unified approach to management of liquidity, capital, and interest rate risk, as well as providing adequate funds to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flow of our customers. We view liquidity as the ability to raise cash at a reasonable cost or with a minimum of loss and as a measure of balance sheet flexibility to react to marketplace, regulatory, and competitive changes. 53 Table of Contents The primary short-term and long-term funding sources we use other than retail deposits include federal funds purchased from other correspondent banks, repurchase agreements from security pledging, advances from the FHLB, use of wholesale time deposits, and advances taken from the Federal Reserve’s Discount Window. Table 29 outlines the available and unused portion of these funding sources (based on collateral and/or company policy limitations) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Currently unused but available funding sources along with a significant amount of overnight liquid funds at December 31, 2011 are considered sufficient to fund anticipated 2012 asset growth. We maintain formal policies to address liquidity contingency needs and to manage a liquidity crisis. Table 28 provides a summary of how the wholesale funding sources normally available to us would be impacted by various operating conditions. Table 28: Environmental Impacts on Availability of Wholesale Funding Sources: Normal Moderately Highly Operating Stressed Stressed Environment Environment Environment Repurchase Agreements Yes Likely* Not Likely FHLB (primary 1-4 REM collateral) Yes Yes* Less Likely* FHLB (secondary loan collateral) Yes Likely* Not Likely Brokered CDs Yes Likely* Not Likely National CDs Yes Likely* Not Likely Fed Funds Lines Yes Less Likely* Not Likely FRB (Borrow-In-Custody) Yes Yes Less Likely* FRB (Discount Window securities) Yes Yes Yes Holding Company line of credit Yes Yes Less Likely* * May be available but subject to restrictions Table 29 summarizes the availability of various wholesale funding sources at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

The most significant portion of the total is $15,000 from our primary correspondent bank, Bankers’ Bank located in Madison, Wisconsin, an increase from $12,500 at December 31, 2010. We make regular use of the Bankers’ Bank line as part of our normal daily cash settlement procedures, but rarely have used the lines offered by the other two correspondent banks. Federal funds must be repaid each day and borrowings may be renewed for up to 14 consecutive business days. To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line, we need to maintain a “composite ratio” as defined by Bankers’ Bank of 40% or less. Bankers’ Bank defines the composite ratio to be nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets divided by tangible capital including the allowance for loan losses calculated at our subsidiary bank level. Due to existence of the composite ratio, an increase in nonaccrual loans or foreclosed assets could impact availability of the line or subject us to further review. In addition, a rising composite ratio could cause our other two correspondent banks to reconsider their federal funds line with us since they do not also serve as our primary correspondent bank. Our subsidiary bank’s composite ratio was approximately 16% and 21% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, and less than the 40% benchmark used by Bankers’ Bank. 54 Table of Contents Federal Reserve discount window advances We have a $100,000 line of credit with the Federal Reserve Discount Window supported by a pledge of both commercial and commercial real estate loans to the Federal Reserve under their Borrower in Custody (“BIC”) program. During 2011, the annualized interest rate applicable to Discount Window advances was .75%. Under the BIC program, we provide a monthly listing of detailed loan information on the loans provided as collateral. We are subject to annual review and certification by the Federal Reserve to retain participation in the program. The Discount Window represents the primary source of liquidity on a daily basis following our federal funds purchased lines of credit discussed above. We were limited to a maximum advance of $100,000 and $94,980 at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, based on the BIC loan collateral pledged. Discount Window advances must be repaid or renewed each day. No Discount Window advances were used during 2011. Only performing loans are permitted as collateral under the BIC and each individual loan is subject to a haircut to collateral value based on the Federal Reserve’s review of the listing each month. In general, approximately 75% of the loan principal offered as collateral is able to support Discount Window advances. Similar to the federal funds purchased lines of credit, an increase in nonperforming loans would decrease the amount of collateral available for Discount Window advances. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances We maintain an available line of credit with the FHLB of Chicago based on a pledge of 1 to 4 family mortgage loan collateral, both first and secondary lien positions. We may borrow on the line to the lesser of the blanket mortgage lien collateral provided, or 20 times our existing FHLB capital stock investment. Based on the our existing $3,250 capital stock investment, total FHLB advances in excess of $65,000 require us to purchase additional FHLB stock equal to 5% of the advance amount. At December 31, 2011, we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to $14,876 of the $22,559 available without the purchase of FHLB stock. At December 31, 2010, we could have drawn an FHLB advance up to $7,566 of the $15,056 available without the purchase of FHLB stock. Further advances of the remaining $7,683 available at December 31, 2011 would have required us to purchase additional FHLB stock totaling $384. FHLB stock pays a nominal dividend of .10% with expectations of continuing this dividend level. Therefore, additional FHLB advances carry additional cost relative to other wholesale borrowing alternatives due to the requirement to hold low yielding FHLB stock. Similar to the Discount Window, only performing residential mortgage loans may be pledged to the FHLB under the blanket lien. In addition, we are subject to a haircut of approximately 36% on first mortgage collateral and 60% on secondary lien collateral at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The FHLB also conducts periodic audits of collateral identification and submission procedures and adjusts the collateral haircuts higher in response to negative exam findings. The FHLB also assigns a credit risk grade to each member based on a quarterly review of the member’s regulatory CALL report. Our current credit risk is within the normal range for a healthy member bank. Negative financial performance trends such as reduced capital levels, increased nonperforming assets, net operating losses, and other factors can increase a member’s credit risk grade. Higher risk grades can require a member to provide detailed loan collateral listings (rather than a blanket lien), physical collateral, and other restrictions on the maximum line usage. FHLB advances are available on a daily basis and along with Discount Window advances represent a primary source of liquidity following our federal funds purchased lines of credit. FHLB advances carry substantial penalties for early prepayment that are generally not recovered from the lower interest rates in refinancing. The amount of early prepayment penalty is a function of the difference between the current borrowing rate, and the rate currently available for refinancing. Under a new collateral and pledging agreement we maintain with the FHLB effective April 12, 2011, we are also permitted to pledge commercial related collateral for advances. However, we did not pledge any commercial loan collateral to the FHLB at December 31, 2011. Recently, the FHLB of Chicago announced a capital stock conversion plan effective January 1, 2012. Under the plan, existing member stock (of which we currently hold $3.25 million) was restructured into two classes. Under the capital conversion plan, the FHLB repurchased $383 of our stock in early 2012. Our remaining shares of $2,867 were restructured and are considered “B-2” capital shares. Excess holdings of B-2 shares may be redeemed by the FHLB at the request of a member following a five year redemption period. However, a member must continue to hold capital stock no less than 5% of outstanding FHLB advances. Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Wholesale repurchase agreements may be available from a correspondent bank counterparty for both overnight and longer terms. Such arrangements typically call for the agreement to be collateralized by us at 110% of the repurchase principal. In the current market, repurchase counterparty providers are extremely limited and would likely require a minimum $10 million transaction. Repurchase agreements could require up to several business days to receive funding. Due to the lack of availability of counterparties offering the product, wholesale repurchase agreements are not a reliable source of liquidity. At December 31, 2011, $13.5 million of our repurchase agreements are wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and $6.2 million are overnight repurchase agreements with local customers using our treasury management services. At December 31, 2010, $13.5 million of our repurchase agreements were wholesale agreements with correspondent banks and $18.0 million were overnight repurchase agreements with local customers. 55 Table of Contents In addition to availability of FHLB advances under the blanket mortgage lien, we also have the ability to pledge investment securities as collateral against FHLB advances. Advances secured by investments are also subject to the FHLB stock ownership requirement as described previously. Due to the need to purchase additional FHLB member stock, FHLB advances secured by investments are not considered a primary source of liquidity. At December 31, 2011, $34,416, of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional $1,721 of member capital stock were purchased. At December 31, 2010, $17,177 of additional FHLB advances were available based on pledging of securities if an additional $859 of member capital stock were purchased. The amount available for pledging increased since December 31, 2010 due to an increase in the securities portfolio in general, and a decrease in local customer repurchase agreements, which freed up security collateral for pledging to the FHLB. Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position, balance sheet, and ongoing earnings, we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market. We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered deposits to 20% of total assets, which gave availability of $50,007 at December 31, 2011 and $57,388 at December 31, 2010. Brokered and national certificates were 12.0% and 10.8% of assets at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. Due to a limited number of providers of repurchase agreement funding as well as our desire to retain unencumbered securities for liquidity purposes and adverse impacts from holding additional FHLB capital stock, brokered certificate of deposit funding is expected to increase to the extent future loan growth is not funded with local deposit growth. Participants in the brokered certificate market must be considered “well capitalized” under current regulatory capital standards to acquire brokered deposits without approval of their primary federal regulator. We regularly acquire brokered deposits from three market providers and maintain relationships with other providers to obtain required funds at the lowest possible cost. Ten business days are typically required between the request for brokered funding and settlement. Therefore, brokered deposits are a reliable, but not daily, source of liquidity. Brokered deposits represent our largest source of wholesale funding and we would see significant negative impacts if capital levels or earnings were to decline to levels not considered to be well capitalized. In addition to the requirement to be considered well-capitalized, banks under regulatory consent orders are not permitted to participate in the brokered deposit market without approval of their primary federal regulator even if they maintain a well-capitalized capital classification. Holding company unsecured line of credit We maintained a $3,000 line of credit with a Bankers’ Bank, Madison, Wisconsin as a contingency liquidity source at December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, we maintained a $1,000 line of credit with U.S. Bank. No amounts were drawn on either line at December 31, 2011 or 2010. Although our bank subsidiary has in the past provided the holding company’s liquidity needs through semi-annual upstream dividends of profits, losses or other negative performance trends could prevent the bank from providing these dividends as cash flow. Because our bank holding company has approximately $892 of financing payments per year as well as approximately $150 of other expenses (before tax benefits), the holding company line of credit is a critical source of potential liquidity. We were subject to financial covenants associated with the line as of December 31, 2011 which required our bank subsidiary to: Maintain Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 risk based capital, and Tier 2 risk based capital ratios above 8%, 10%, and 12%, respectively. Maintain nonperforming assets (excluding accruing troubled debt restructured loans) as a percentage of tangible equity plus the allowance for loan losses to less than 20%. At December 31, 2011, we were not in violation of any of the line of credit covenants. A violation of any covenant could prevent us from utilizing the unused balance of the line of credit. The line of credit expires during December 2012 but is expected to be renewed upon maturity. If liquidity needs persist after exhausting all available funds from the sources described above, we would consider more drastic methods to raise funds including, but not limited to, sale of investment securities at a loss, cessation of lending to new or existing customers, sale of branch real estate in a sale-leaseback transaction, surrender of bank owned life insurance to obtain the cash surrender value net of taxes due, packaging and sale of residential mortgage loan pools held in our portfolio, sale of foreclosed assets at a loss, and sale of mortgage servicing rights. Such actions could generate undesirable sale losses or income tax impacts. While sale of additional common stock or issuance of other types of capital could provide additional liquidity, the ability to find significant buyers of such capital issues during a liquidity crisis would be difficult making such a source of funding unlikely or unreliable if the liquidity crisis was caused by our deteriorating financial condition. 56 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 Overnight federal funds purchased Our aggregate federal funds purchase availability was $25,500 at December 31, 2010 compared to $24,500 at December 31, 2009. To unilaterally draw on the existing federal funds line, we need to maintain a “composite ratio” as defined by Bankers’ Bank of 40% or less. At December 31, 2010, our subsidiary bank’s composite ratio was approximately 24% and less than the 40% benchmark used by Bankers’ Bank. During 2010 and 2009, the only federal funds line used was our $12,500 line from Bankers’ Bank as part of our regular daily cash management system. Federal Reserve discount window advances During 2009, we were granted permission by the Federal Reserve to participate in their Borrower in Custody (“BIC”) program that allows us to pledge performing commercial and commercial real estate loans against overnight Discount Window advances. During 2009, the annualized interest rate due on Discount Window advances was .50%, although this rate was increased to .75% by the Federal Reserve on February 18, 2010. We could draw up to $100 million on our Discount Window line of credit, but were limited to a maximum advance of $94,980 and $74,261 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively based on the BIC loan collateral pledged. At December 31, 2010, we could borrow on the Discount Window approximately 55% to 60% of the principal amount of loans pledged under the BIC program. No Discount Window advances were used during 2010 or 2009. Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances under blanket mortgage lien and other FHLB advances During 2009, the FHLB made available the pledging of certain municipal investment securities against advances, which could increase our maximum advance liquidity with the FHLB, although this increase is not reflected in Table 29 due to specific limitations on the municipal securities eligible to be pledged. Although up to an additional $15,056 of FHLB advances could be obtained on existing mortgage collateral, due to our desire to maintain our current investment in FHLB capital stock of $3,250, the amount of unused but available FHLB advances at December 31, 2010 before additional capital stock would be required is $7,566. Repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by investment securities Securities not pledged to the Federal Reserve for the Discount Window or pledged to the FHLB for advances are available for pledging against repurchase agreements. During 2009, borrower costs related to repurchase agreements increased compared to other wholesale funding alternatives and the number of correspondent banks providing such financing declined. No wholesale repurchase agreements were used during 2010. As an alternative to pledging securities against repurchase agreements, such securities could also be pledged against FHLB advances, as noted previously, subject to the purchase of additional FHLB capital stock for aggregate advances in excess of $65,000. Wholesale market deposits Due to the strength of our capital position, balance sheet, and ongoing earnings, we enjoy the lowest possible costs when purchasing wholesale certificates of deposit on the brokered market. We have an internal policy that limits use of brokered certificates to 20% of total assets, which gave availability of $57,388 at December 31, 2010, and $44,176 at December 31, 2009. Brokered certificates were 10.8% of assets at December 31, 2010 and 12.7% of assets at December 31, 2009. Holding company unsecured line of credit Our parent company, PSB Holdings, Inc. maintained a $1,000 line of credit with U.S. Bank as contingency liquidity at the holding company level at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The line of credit remained unused during 2010 and 2009. Liquidity Measurements and Contingency Plan Our liquidity management and contingency plan calls for quarterly measurement of key funding, capital, problem loan, and liquidity contingency ratios at our banking subsidiary level. The measurements are compared to various risk levels that direct management to further responses to declining liquidity measurements as outlined below: Risk Level 1 is defined as circumstances that create the potential for elevated liquidity risk, thus requiring an assessment of possible funding deficiencies. Normal business operations, plans and strategies are not anticipated to be immediately impacted. Risk Level 2 is defined as circumstances that point to an increased potential for disruptions in the Bank’s funding plans, needs and/or resources. Assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis is more urgent, and identification and prioritization of pre-emptive alternatives and actions may be both warranted and time sensitive. 57 Table of Contents Risk Level 3 is defined as circumstances that create a likely funding problem, or are symptomatic of circumstances that are highly correlated with impending funding problems; and, therefore, are expected to require some level of immediate action depending upon the situation. These risk parameters and other qualitative and environmental factors are considered to determine whether a “Stress Level” response is required. Identification of a risk trigger does not automatically call for a stress level response. The following summarizes our response plans to various degrees of liquidity stress: Stress Level A – Management provides a written summary evaluating the warning indicators and why it is deemed unlikely that there will be a resulting liquidity challenge. Stress Level B – Management provides an assessment of the probability of a liquidity crisis and completes a sources and uses of funds report to estimate the impact on pro forma liquidity. Liquidity stress tests will be reviewed to ensure the scenarios being simulated are sufficiently robust and that there is adequate funding to satisfy potential demands for cash. Various pre-emptive actions will be considered and acted on as needed. Stress Level C – Management has determined a funding crisis is likely and documents detailed assessments of the current liquidity situation and future liquidity needs. The Board approved action plan is carried out with vigor and may call for one or all of the following steps, among others, to mitigate the liquidity concern: sale of loans, intensify local deposit gathering programs, transferring unencumbered securities and loans to the Federal Reserve for Discount Window borrowings, curtail all lending except for specifically approved loans, reduce or suspend stock dividends, and investigate opportunities to raise new capital. During 2011, we increased our “Risk Level 1” trigger points related to commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans relative to capital. The Risk Level 1 trigger for commercial and industrial loans was increased from 200% of capital at December 31, 2010 to 250% of capital as of December 31, 2011. Likewise, the Risk Level 1 trigger for commercial real estate loans was increased from 300% at December 31, 2010 to 350% at December 31, 2011. These increases were considered appropriate due to our concentration on commercial related lending to local borrowers and relatively low levels of capital, and therefore we consistently exceeded these triggers at the prior year levels. However, we have historically experienced net loan charge-offs on commercial related lending less than similar sized banks and do not consider this mix of loans to signify an undercapitalized position. No Risk Level triggers were exceeded at December 31, 2011 and no liquidity stress levels were considered to exist. At December, 31, 2010, commercial and industrial loans were 215% of capital and commercial real estate loans were 327% of capital, exceeding their “Risk Level 1” trigger points of 200% and 300%, respectively. However, no liquidity stress level was considered to exist at December 31, 2010. As part of our formal quarterly asset-liability management projections, we also measure basic surplus as the amount of existing net liquid assets (after deducting short-term liabilities and coverage for anticipated deposit funding outflows during the next 30 days) divided by total assets. The basic surplus calculation does not consider unused but available correspondent bank federal funds purchased, as those funds are subject to availability based on the correspondent bank’s own liquidity needs and therefore are not guaranteed contractual funds. However, basic surplus does include unused but available FHLB advances under the open line of credit supported by a blanket lien on mortgage collateral. Basic surplus does not include available brokered certificate of deposit funding as those funds generally may not be obtained within one business day following the request for funding. Our policy is to maintain a basic surplus of at least 5%. Basic surplus was 7.9% and 8.7% at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. CAPITAL RESOURCES We are required to maintain minimum levels of capital to be considered well-capitalized under current banking regulation. Refer to Item 8, Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these requirements and our current capital position relative to these requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for higher regulatory minimums to be considered well capitalized. Although we expect the new capital guidelines to be published in 2012, no written guidance has yet been provided on how much the minimum levels will be raised. In addition, regulatory limitations on fee income and higher compliance burdens are expected to spur a wave of bank consolidation and merger and acquisition activity in the coming years. Acquisition of another bank or bank location for growth would likely pressure our regulatory capital ratios lower and increase the potential for a new common or preferred stock capital issue which could dilute existing stockholders. The primary increase in stockholders’ equity during the three years ended December 31, 2011 has been retained net income not distributed to stockholders via cash dividends or share buybacks on the open market. Failure to remain well-capitalized would prevent us from obtaining future wholesale broker time deposits which have been an important source of funding during the past several years. Refer to Item 8, Statement of Changes in Stockholder’s Equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed activity in the capital accounts. Average tangible common capital to total assets was 8.11% during 2011 and 7.43% during 2010. Table 30 presents a reconciliation of stockholders’ equity as presented in the consolidated balance sheets for the three years ended December 31, 2011 to regulatory capital. 58 Table of Contents Table 30: Capital Ratios At December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Stockholders’ equity $ 50,362 $ 46,690 $ 42,270 Junior subordinated debentures, net 7,500 7,500 7,500 Disallowed mortgage servicing right assets (121 ) (110 ) (115 ) Accumulated other comprehensive income (1,934 ) (2,528 ) (1,781 ) Tier 1 regulatory capital 55,807 51,552 47,874 Senior subordinated notes 7,000 7,000 7,000 Add: allowance for loan losses 5,745 5,654 6,121 Total regulatory capital $ 68,552 $ 64,206 $ 60,995 Average tangible assets $ 602,071 $ 607,954 $ 589,241 Risk-weighted assets (as defined by current regulations) $ 457,443 $ 449,987 $ 488,226 Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio) 9.27% 8.48% 8.12% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 12.20% 11.46% 9.81% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.99% 14.27% 12.49% Capital Ratios – Peoples State Bank – Subsidiary Bank: Tier 1 capital to average tangible assets (leverage ratio) 9.99% 9.37% 9.16% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 13.13% 12.64% 11.05% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 14.39% 13.90% 12.30% Capital increased $3,672, or 7.9%, during 2011 from retained net income of $4,137 which offset a $594 decline in accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2010, capital increased $4,420, or 10.5%, from retained net income of $3,626 and an increase in unrealized gain on securities available for sale of $767. We pay a regular semi-annual cash dividend as described in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Prior to 2008, we maintained an informal, annual, ongoing share repurchase program of up to 1% of outstanding shares per year as described in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the difficulty and related cost of raising new capital to support asset growth at this time, we temporarily suspended the buyback program beginning during 2008 and no shares were repurchased during the three years ended December 31, 2011. While we do not expect to buyback a significant number of shares as treasury stock during 2012, share repurchases on the open market are one strategy we could consider to build shareholder value if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year. During 2009, we issued $7,000 of senior subordinated notes to provide regulatory capital to support commercial loan growth during 2007 and 2008. Refer to Item 8, Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the issue. Beginning July 1, 2012, we have the ability to repay the Notes in part or in full. Repayment of the Notes to reduce interest expense is a strategy that could be considered during 2012 if capital is believed to be excessively high during the coming year. We have issued trust preferred securities represented by junior subordinated debentures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets which may provide up to 25% of our total Tier 1 regulatory capital. Refer to Item 8, Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information on the trust preferred security issue. The Dodd-Frank Act no longer permits us to issue new trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital as in prior years, although our existing $7.5 million trust preferred capital securities are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital. Senior Subordinated Notes and Junior Subordinated Debentures represent approximately 21% of our total regulatory capital. Unlike our common stock, these capital obligations require regular quarterly interest payments that may not be eliminated if our financial condition were to deteriorate (although the interest payments on junior subordinated notes could be deferred for up to five years before considered a default of the debt). Therefore, we expect any future capital needs during the next several years beyond retained earnings from operations to be met via issuance of our authorized common or preferred stock, although no current plans for issuance of common or preferred stock exist. 59 Table of Contents In December 2010, the U.S. Treasury introduced a new small bank capital program known as the “Small Business Lending Fund” established by the Small Business Jobs Act with funding up to $30 billion in an effort to spur small business lending. Under the program, only available to well performing banks less than $10 billion in assets such as us, banks may issue Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury with a variable dividend rate that could later be fixed as low as 1% depending on the level of small business lending growth during the first 10 quarters following issuance of the preferred stock. The preferred stock dividend later resets to 9% on the 4 ½ year anniversary of the preferred stock issue until repaid. We decided not to participate in the Small Business Lending Fund due to concerns over the extent of organic loan growth available and strict limitations on using the capital to support assets obtained in purchase of another bank as well has our historically high level of existing regulatory capital. We are considered well-capitalized under regulatory capital rules with total risk adjusted capital of 14.99% at December 31, 2011 compared to 14.27% at December 31, 2010. Current regulations require a minimum total risk adjusted capital ratio of 10.00% to be considered well-capitalized. During 2010, total risk weighted assets declined from recognition of certain five or more family real estate mortgage loans as subject to 50% risk weighting, rather than the 100% risk weighting assigned in prior years. In addition, we were relieved of a guarantee liability on customer debt to a correspondent bank during 2010 which further reduced risk weighted assets and increased the total risk adjusted capital ratio. These changes, along with retained 2010 net income, increased total regulatory capital significantly higher than 2009. We maintain an incentive stock option plan approved by stockholders during 2001 and a restricted stock plan as described in Item 8, Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The total expense recognized under both plans was $78, $43, and $25, during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As a measurement of the adequacy of a bank’s capital base related to its level of nonperforming assets, many investors use a “non-GAAP” measure commonly referred to as the “Texas Ratio.” We also track changes in our Texas Ratio against our internal capital and liquidity risk parameters to highlight negative capital trends that could impact our ability for future growth, payment of dividends to shareholders, or other factors. As noted previously, correspondent bank providers of our daily federal funds purchased line of credit and the holding company operating line of credit use similar measures that impact our ability to continued use of those lines of credit if our level of nonperforming assets to capital were to rise above prescribed levels. The following table presents the calculation of our Texas Ratio. Table 31: Calculation of “Texas Ratio” (a non-GAAP measure) as of December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 Total nonperforming assets $ 17,883 $ 16,389 $ 17,074 Total stockholders’ equity $ 50,362 $ 46,690 $ 42,270 Less: Mortgage servicing rights, net (intangible assets) (1,205 ) (1,100 ) (1,147 ) Less: Preferred stock capital elements – – – Add: Allowance for loan losses 7,941 7,960 7,611 Total tangible common stockholders’ equity and reserves $ 57,098 $ 53,550 $ 48,734 Total nonperforming assets as a percentage of total tangible common stockholders’ equity and reserves 31.32% 30.61% 35.04% 60 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE-SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We service residential mortgage loans originated by our lenders and sold to the FHLB and FNMA. As a FHLB Mortgage Partnership Finance (“MPF”) loan servicer, we provide a credit enhancement guarantee to reimburse the FHLB for foreclosure losses in excess of 1% of the original loan principal sold to the FHLB prior to November 2008. Refer to Item 8, Notes 4, 6, and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the FHLB MPF program. These first mortgage loans are underwritten using standardized criteria we consider to be conservative on residential properties in our local communities. We believe loans serviced for the FHLB will realize minimal foreclosure losses in the future and that we will experience no loan losses related to charge-offs in excess of the FHLB 1% First Loss Account. The north central Wisconsin residential real estate market is experiencing similar home value declines as the state of Wisconsin as a whole, which are moderate when compared to other states in the country. The average residential first mortgage originated by us under the FHLB program which required a credit enhancement was approximately $154 in 2008 and $140 during 2007, the last two years of the program. Under bank regulatory capital rules, this FHLB recourse obligation to the FHLB is risk-weighted for the purposes of the total capital to risk-weighted assets capital calculation. Total risk-based capital required to be held for the recourse obligations under the FHLB MPF programs for capital adequacy purposes was $1,859 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and $1,901 at December 31, 2009. During October 2008, we ceased origination and sale of loans to the FHLB that required a credit enhancement and no additional risk-based capital will be required to support such loans. More information on all loans serviced for other investors, including FHLB and FNMA, is outlined in Table 32. Other significant off-balance sheet financial instruments include the various loan commitments outlined in Item 8, Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These lending commitments are a traditional and customary part of lending operations and many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. During 2011, we sold a new product that allowed certain adjustable rate commercial loan customers to fix their interest rate with an interest rate swap. Refer to Item 8, Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the program. At December 31, 2011, there were $14,324 in interest rate swaps outstanding under the program. Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing We service $261,811 and $260,097 of residential real estate loans which have been sold to the FHLB and FNMA at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Loans sold to FHLB and FNMA are not reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. An annualized servicing fee equal to .25% of outstanding principal is retained from payments collected from the customer as compensation for servicing the loan for the FHLB and FNMA. For loans originated and sold to the FHLB prior to November 2008, we are also paid an annualized “credit enhancement” fee of .07% to .10% of outstanding serviced principal in addition to the .25% collected for servicing the loan for the FHLB impacting $51,518, or 20%, of loans serviced for the FHLB at December 31, 2011 compared to $70,209, or 27%, at December 31, 2010. See also “Off Balance Sheet Arrangements” in Item 8, Note 17 and “Loans” in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage loan servicing and credit enhancement fees have been an important source of mortgage banking income. Because no further loans are sold to the FHLB with our credit enhancement, we expect credit enhancement fees to decline in future years as this serviced principal is repaid. Credit enhancements fees were $16 in 2011, $29 in 2010, and $105 in 2009. Refer to Item 8, Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of mortgage banking revenue. We recognize a mortgage servicing right asset due to the substantial volume of loans serviced for the FHLB and FNMA. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our mortgage servicing right accounting policies. Losses incurred by the FHLB on loans in the MPF 100 program and the MPF 125 program are absorbed by the FHLB in their First Loss Account. If cumulative losses were to exceed the First Loss Account, we would reimburse the FHLB for any excess losses up to the extent of our Credit Enhancement Guarantee. Ten years after the original pool master commitment date, the First Loss Account and the Credit Enhancement Guarantee are reset to current levels based on loans remaining in the pool. These factors are further reset every subsequent five years until the pool is repaid. During 2010, the MPF 100 program reached its ten year anniversary and the First Loss Account and Credit Enhancement Guarantee associated with that program were reset to the new level shown in Table 32. The next First Loss Account reset date for any individual master commitment containing our Credit Enhancement Guarantee is scheduled for August 18, 2013. Due to historical strength of mortgage borrowers in our markets and relative stability of collateral home values, and the original 1% of principal First Loss Account provided by the FHLB, we believe the possibility of losses under guarantees to the FHLB to be remote. Since inception of our pools containing guarantees to the FHLB in 2000, only $0.3 million of $425 million of loans originated with guarantees have incurred a principal loss, all of which has been borne by the FHLB within their First Loss Account. Accordingly, no provision for a recourse liability has been made for this recourse obligation on loans currently serviced by us. Loans originated and sold to the FHLB under their XTRA program do not require credit enhancement and PSB has no risk of principal loss on such loans properly underwritten and sold. 61 Table of Contents All loans sold to FHLB or FNMA in which we retain the loan servicing are subject to underwriting representations and warranties made by us as the originator and we are subject to annual underwriting audits from both entities. Our representations and warranties would allow FHLB or FNMA to require us to repurchase inadequately originated loans for any number of underwriting violations. During 2011, we were required to repurchase a foreclosed loan and incur a $37 loss related to underwriting violations related to private mortgage guarantee insurance. We have reviewed our existing portfolio and believe we do not have continued risk for significant loss on other loans that could have this underwriting issue. Other than this loan, we have originated loans to these secondary market providers since 2000 and have never been required to repurchase a loan for underwriting or servicing violations and do not expect to be required to repurchase loans in the near term. Table 32 summarizes the various programs and investors for which we serviced loans as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

During 2011, the serviced portfolio increased just $1,714, or 0.7%, and we do not expect significant serviced loan growth during 2012. Contractual Obligations We are a party to various contractual obligations requiring use of funds as part of our normal operations. Table 33 outlines the principal amounts and timing of these obligations, excluding amounts due for interest, if applicable. Nonmaturity deposits and overnight federal funds purchased and overnight repurchase obligations are not included in Table 33 because they are not classified as long-term obligations. Most of these obligations shown in the Table, including FHLB advances and time deposits, are routinely refinanced into a similar replacement obligation without requiring any substantial outflow of cash. However, renewal of these obligations is dependent on our ability to offer competitive market equivalent interest rates or availability of collateral for pledging such as retained mortgage loans or securities as in the case of advances from the FHLB. Our funds management policy includes a formal liquidity contingency plan to identify low cost and liquid funds available in the event of a liquidity crisis as outlined under the section labeled, “LIQUIDITY” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 62 Table of Contents Table 33: Long-Term Contractual Obligations at December 31, 2011 Principal payments due by period Total < 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years > 5 years Federal Home Loan Bank advances $ 50,124 $ – $ 50,124 $ – $ – Long-term other borrowings 13,500 – 8,000 – 5,500 Junior subordinated debentures 7,732 – – – 7,732 Senior subordinated notes 7,000 – – – 7,000 Deferred compensation agreements 2,378 27 264 370 1,717 Post-retirement health insurance benefits plan 78 8 17 19 34 Long-term charitable contribution commitments 25 4 10 11 – Branch bank operating lease commitments 23 23 – – – Total long-term contractual obligations before time deposits 80,860 62 58,415 400 21,983 Time deposits 166,268 84,417 51,414 30,437 – Total long-term contractual obligations including time deposits $ 247,128 $ 84,479 $ 109,829 $ 30,837 $ 21,983 Item 7A.

		<c><![CDATA[and Results of Operations Business Outlook Management expects revenues in fiscal 2013 to increase over fiscal year 2012. Expectations are for product mix and margins to remain favorable for fiscal year 2013. During fiscal 2012 new orders received by the Company were approximately $44.4 million. The order backlog of approximately $ 50.8 million at June 30, 2012 gives the Company a solid base of future sales. It is presently anticipated that a minimum of $30 million of orders comprising the June 30, 2012 backlog will be filled during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. The minimum of $30 million does not include any shipments, which may be made against orders subsequently received during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. See discussions below for further detail on the customer mix included in the backlog. In addition to the backlog, the Company currently has outstanding quotations representing in excess of $32 million in the aggregate for both repeat and new programs. The outstanding quotations encompass various new and previously manufactured power supplies, transformers, and subassemblies. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will acquire any or all of the anticipated orders described above, many of which are subject to allocations of the United States defense spending and factors affecting the defense industry and military procurement generally. Two significant customers represented 60% and 62% of the Company's total sales in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. These sales are in connection with multiyear programs in which the Company is a significant subcontractor. The June 30, 2012 backlog of $50.8 million includes orders from two customers that represent 52% and 10% of the total backlog. A loss of one of these customers or programs related to these customers could significantly impact the Company. Historically, a small number of customers have accounted for a large percentage of the Company’s total sales in any given fiscal year. For several years, management has pursued opportunities with current and new customers with an overall objective of lowering the concentration of sales, mitigating excessive reliance upon a single major product of a particular program and minimizing the impact of the loss of a single significant customer. Management continues to evaluate its business development functions and potential revised courses of action in order to diversify its customer base. The Company currently has a very high concentration level with two customers and this presents significant risk. Management, along with the Board of Directors, continues to evaluate the need and use of the Company’s working capital. Capital expenditures are expected to be app roximately $200,000 for fiscal 2013. Expectations are that the working capital will be required to fund orders, dividend payments, and general operations of the business. From time to time, management along with the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee of the Board of Directors examine opportunities involving acquisitions or other strategic options, including buying certain products or product lines. The criteria for consideration are synergies with the Company’s existing product base and accretion to earnings. 7 Results of Operations Net Sales for fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, were $32,037,357 and $29,499,504, respectively, an 8.6% increase. This increase can be attributed to the contract specific nature of the Company’s business and the timing of deliveries on these contracts . More specifically, shipments of power supplies increased by approximately $1.4 million while transformers increased by approximately $1.9 million. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 gross profits were $8,820,163 and $ 8,206,199, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales remained consistent at 27.5% and 27.8%, for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. The primary factor in determining gross profit and net income is product mix. The gross profits on mature products and build to print contracts are higher as compared to products that are still in the engineering development stage or in the early stages of production. In any given accounting period the mix of product shipments between higher margin mature programs and less mature programs including loss contracts, has a significant impact on gross profit and net income. The increased gross profit in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of increased sales volume. Employment of full time equivalents at June 30, 2012 and June 30, 2011 was 165 people. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2,828,409 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, a decrease of $ 77,507, or 2.7% as compared to the prior year. The decrease for fiscal 2012 relates primarily to a decrease in salary expense as well as relocation and transportation cost decreases. Other income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $89,702 and $81,259, respectively. The increase is attributable higher sales of left over scrap metal. The effective income tax rate was 27.8% in fiscal 2012 and 28.3% in fiscal 2011. The effective tax rate is less than the statutory tax rate mainly due to the benefit the Company receives on its “qualified production activities” under The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the benefit derived from the dividends paid on allocated ESOP shares. Net income for fiscal 2012, was $4,390,268 or $2.02 and $1.99 per share, basic and diluted, respectively, compared to net income of $3,857,537 or $1.79 and $1.77 per share, basic and diluted, respectively, for fiscal 2011. The increase in net income per share was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross profit on sales, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's working capital is an appropriate indicator of the liquidity of its business, and during the past two fiscal years, the Company, when possible, has funded all of its operations with cash flows resulting from operating activities and when necessary from its existing cash and investments. The Company did not borrow any funds during the last two fiscal years. The Company's working capital as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $27,199,385 and $26,124,431, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company repurchased 6,269 and 23,342 shares, respectively, of its common stock for a total purchase price of $143,731 and $575,246, respectively. All shares were purchased from the Company's ESOP. Under existing authorizations from the Company's Board of Directors, as of June 30, 2012, management is authorized to purchase an additional $1,856,268 million of Company stock. The table below presents the summary of cash flow information for the fiscal year indicated: 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 7,386,326 $ 4,913,449 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (1,463,276 ) 4,515,760 Net cash used in financing activities (4,095,437 ) (4,208,464 ) 8 Net cash provided by operating activities fluctuates between periods primarily as a result of differences in net income, the timing of the collection of accounts receivable, purchase of inventory, level of sales and payments of accounts payable. Net cash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in purchases of investment securities and a decrease in proceeds from maturity of investment securities. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is due primarily to an increase in the purchase of treasury stock. The Company currently believes that the cash flow generated from operations and when necessary, from cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet its long-term funding requirements for the foreseeable future. Management believes that the Company's reserve for bad debts of $3,000 is adequate given the customers with whom the Company does business. Historically, bad debt expense has been minimal. During fiscal year 2012 and fiscal 2011, the Company expended $267,983 and $607,311, respectively, for plant improvements and new equipment. The Company has budgeted approximately $200,000 for new equipment and plant improvements in fiscal 2013. Management anticipates that the funds required will be available from current operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 to the financial statements. We believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on our contracts. Revenue Recognition and Estimates A significant portion of our business is comprised of development and production contracts. Generally revenues on long-term fixed-price contracts are recorded on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. Percentage of completion accounting requires judgment relative to expected sales, estimating costs and making assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedules. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of overhead costs. The estimation of cost at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Given the significance of the estimation processes and judgments described above, it is possible that materially different amounts of expected sales and contract costs could be recorded if different assumptions were used, based on changes in circumstances, in the estimation process. When a change in expected sales value or estimated cost is determined, changes are reflected in current period earnings. 9 ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[  . General The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto which appear in Item 8 of this Report. Overview Revenues for fiscal 2012 increased by 5.3% over fiscal 2011, however, net earnings decreased by 15.3%. The decrease in earnings for the year is attributed to increased expenses needed to reorganize the Company’s license operations in Mexico and full year expenses for an expanded sales staff. The Company believes that these investments in staff will strengthen the Company and provide greater returns during fiscal 2013. Gross profit margins decreased slightly mostly due to product mix. Foreign sales increased by 3.8%. Markets have begun to stabilize and new orders are trending higher. As a result, the Company expects to begin fiscal 2013 with an increased backlog. Inventories at June 30, 2012 were 3.5% higher than at year end fiscal 2011, which were needed to support the higher incoming sales rate. Cash decreased by $379,080 to $6,527,940 mostly due to the $.05 per share special dividend (an aggregate of $351,687) paid in December 2011. Prospects for fiscal 2013 appear favorable as the economy continues to improve and credit is becoming more available. In August 2012, the Company received a number of large contracts on which the Company had submitted favorable bids. These contracts, which are scheduled to be shipped in fiscal 2013, have substantially increased the Company's subsequent backlog. With a strong financial position and an experienced and reorganized sales staff, the Company is hopeful it will improve its performance in fiscal 2013. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, cash decreased by $379,080 compared to an increase of $845,642 during fiscal 2011. The following table summarizes the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Years Ended June 30, Net cash provided (used) by: 2012 2011 Operating activities $ 38,053 $ 868,997 Investing activities $ (65,446 ) $ (23,355 ) Financing activities $ (351,687 ) $ — For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, operating activities provided cash of $38,053 compared to $868,997 of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011. Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 was primarily provided by the Company’s net earnings of $511,689 and non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of $49,924, bad debt expenses of $26,269 and a benefit of $25,752 in deferred income taxes. Additional cash was provided by a decrease in leases and mortgages receivables of $31,313 and deferred income of $20,000. These increases in cash were offset by an increase in accounts and trade notes receivables of $199,551 as shipments were heavy during the last month of fiscal 2012 and payments were not yet due. Cash of $81,059 was used to increase inventories to support new orders. In addition a decrease of $98,683 in accounts payable and accrued expenses represents early payments to vendors so that discounts could be realized. Cash was also used to decrease accrued employee expenses by $56,748. Income taxes payable and refundable income taxes used cash of $66,247. Customer deposits decreased by $99,928 due to shipments made in the third quarter from the Company’s backlog while newer orders did not require deposits due to their smaller size. Other assets used cash of $25,197 in the normal course of business. 9 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily provided by the Company’s net earnings of $603,773 and by an increase of $389,728 in customer deposits. The increase in customer deposits resulted from increased orders which trended higher than sales during the period. Cash was also provided by non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of $55,872, bad debts of $10,511 and a benefit of $36,382 in deferred income taxes. Other changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash were increases in income taxes payable of $41,451 and accrued employee expenses of $22,007 and decreases in leases and mortgages receivable of $10,913 and other current assets of $11,161. The primary use of cash in fiscal 2011 was an increase in inventories of $416,857, partially offset by a $208,008 increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing unpaid invoices not yet due to support the increase in inventories. Other uses of cash consisted of a $52,964 increase in accounts and trade notes receivable and a reduction of $50,988 in inventory reserves. This reserve was placed against returned inventory in prior years which the Company resold during the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Investing activities used cash of $65,446 and $23,355 for the years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, mostly for capital expenditures. Financing activities used cash of $351,687 in fiscal 2012 to pay dividends. There were no expenditures in financing activities during fiscal 2011. The Company’s original $2,250,000 revolving line of credit facility expired on October 31, 2011. Due to a change in ownership at the Company’s former lender as a result of the acquisition of the former lender by a new lender, a new line of credit facility was entered into on November 16, 2011. The new credit facility provides a revolving line of credit that entitles the Company to borrow, from time to time, up to $2,250,000, including a $1,000,000 standby letter of credit sub-facility for the purchase of inventory and a $250,000 foreign exchange contract sub-facility. The Company’s obligations under the new facility are guaranteed by the Company’s subsidiaries and collateralized by substantially all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ assets. No amounts were outstanding under either facility at June 30, 2012 and 2011, nor were there any amounts outstanding at any time during fiscal 2012 or 2011. The new facility requires maintenance of certain debt service coverage and leverage ratios and contained other restrictive covenants, including limitations on the extent to which the Company and its subsidiaries could incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, guarantee indebtedness of others, grant liens, sell assets and make investments. The Company was in compliance with these covenants at June 30, 2012 and 2011. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, net cash from operations and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its operations and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and to meet its long term liquidity needs. Off-Balance Sheet Financing The Company has no off-balance sheet financing arrangements within the meaning of Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. Results of Operations Year Ended June 30, 2012 2011 Net sales $ 22,075,970 $ 20,963,876 +5.3% Development fees, franchise and license fees, commissions and other 381,119 361,851 +5.3% Total revenues $ 22,457,089 $ 21,325,727 +5.3% Net sales for the year ended June 30, 2012 increased by $1,112,094 (5.3%) over fiscal 2011. For the twelve month period ended June 30, 2012, equipment and parts sales increased by 6.6% and 4.6%, respectively, over fiscal 2011 attributable to a reorganized sales staff which enabled the Company to have greater penetration of its territory. Although the economy is still unstable, new orders have been trending higher, increasing the Company’s backlog at year end 2012 compared to 2011. During the year foreign sales also increased by 3.8%. 10 Table of Contents Revenues of development fees, franchising and license fees, commission and other income increased by $19,268 (5.3%) in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011. The improvement can be attributed to the reorganization of our Mexican licensing operations and an increase in equipment restocking charges, which offset a substantial commission received in fiscal 2011 on a sale by another distributor for an installation in the Company’s territory. Year Ended June 30, 2012 2011 As a percentage of net sales: Cost of sales, net 76.7 % 76.4 % As a percentage of revenues: Selling, general and administrative expenses 21.0 % 20.4 % Total expenses 96.4 % 95.5 % Cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of sales, increased to 76.7% in fiscal 2012 from 76.4% in fiscal 2011. The percentage varies slightly from year to year due to the mix of products sold. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $364,308 (8.4%) in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 21.0% from 20.4%. The increase was mostly attributable to the increase in payroll expenses as a result of the reorganization and expansion of the sales staff. Also contributing to the increase were stockholder expenses, as the Company now must adhere to XBRL reporting requirements, and professional fees. Offsetting these increases in administrative expenses were decreases in office expenses, service engineering and travel and entertainment expenses. Interest income decreased by $2,171 (10.0%) in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011, mostly due to lower prevailing interest rates. The Company’s effective income tax rate increased to 38.2% in fiscal 2012 from 38.1% in fiscal 2011. The slight variation in percentage reflects changes in both permanent and temporary adjustments to taxable income. Inflation Inflation has not had a significant effect on the Company’s operations during any of the reported periods. Transactions with Related Parties The Company leases 27,000 square feet of warehouse and office space from the Sheila Steiner Revocable Trust. The trustees of this trust are Sheila Steiner, her husband, William K. Steiner, and her son, Michael S. Steiner. William K. Steiner is Chairman of the Board of Directors and a director of the Company and Michael S. Steiner is President and a director of the Company. Michael Steiner, individually, is also a principal shareholder of the Company. Annual rental expense under this lease was approximately $119,600 in fiscal 2012 and $116,100 in fiscal 2011. The lease was for an original three year term which commenced on November 1, 2005, with two three-year renewal options in favor of the Company. The Company has exercised the second renewal option, extending the lease until October 31, 2014. The lease provides for annual rent increases commencing November 1, 2006 of 3% over the rent in the prior year. The Company bears the cost of real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance, non-structural repairs and insurance. The Company believes that the terms of the lease are comparable to terms that would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party for similar property in a similar locale. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company paid a law firm, in which a director is Senior Counsel, approximately $59,300 and $44,300, respectively, for legal services performed. 11 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Securities and Exchange Commission Financial Reporting Release No. 60 encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements: Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, leases and mortgages, the carrying value of inventories and long-lived assets, the timing of revenue recognition for initial license and franchise fees from sales of franchise arrangements and continuing license and franchise service fees, as well as sales returns. Management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recognition of revenues and expenses and the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition and Accounts and Trade Notes Receivable Products are generally shipped Freight on Board (FOB) from the Company’s warehouse or drop shipped from the Company’s Vendor FOB, at which time risk of loss and title passes to the purchaser. Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of the arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. In some cases, the Company collects non-income related taxes, including sales and use tax, from its customers and remits those taxes to governmental authorities. The Company presents revenues net of these taxes. Shipping, delivery and handling fee income is included in revenues in the consolidated financial statements. Shipping, delivery and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Commissions and development fees are recorded when earned, generally when the services are performed or the transaction is closed. Individual franchise arrangements include a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing royalties. Initial franchise fees are generally recorded upon the opening of the franchised store, which is evidenced by a certificate from the franchisee, indicating that the store has opened, and collectability is reasonably assured. Continuing royalties represent regular contractual payments received for the use of the “DRYCLEAN USA” marks, which are recognized as revenue when earned, generally on a straight line basis. Accounts and trade notes receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company sells its products primarily to independent and franchise dry clean stores and chains, laundry plants, hotels, motels, cruise lines, hospitals, nursing homes, government institutions and distributors. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and, depending on the term of credit, the amount of the credit granted and management’s past history with a customer, the Company may require the customer to grant a security interest in the purchased equipment as collateral for the receivable. Senior management reviews accounts and trade notes receivable on a regular basis to determine if any such amounts will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any balances that are determined to be uncollectible, along with a general reserve based on older aged amounts, in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off. Based on the information available to management, it believes the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as of June 30, 2012 and 2011 is adequate. However, actual write-offs might exceed the recorded allowance. 12 Table of Contents Franchise License, Trademark and Other Intangible Assets Franchise licenses, trademarks, patents and trade names are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Those assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited (10-15 years). Patents are amortized over the shorter of the patents’ useful life or legal life from the date such patents are granted. The Company reviews the recoverability of intangible assets based primarily upon an analysis of undiscounted cash flows from the intangible assets. In the event the expected future net cash flows should become less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss will be recorded in the period the determination is made based on the fair value of the related assets. Income Taxes The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax base. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. If it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recognized. Significant judgment is required in developing the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. Management evaluates its ability to realize its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts its valuation allowance when it believes that it is more likely that the asset will not be realized. The Company follows ASC Topic 740-10-25, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. The Company does not believe that there are any unrecognized tax benefits related to certain tax positions taken on its various income tax returns. The Company continues to remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state authorities for the years 2008 through 2011. 13 Table of Contents Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance: In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements” (“ASU 2010-06”). ASU 2010-06 amends ASC Topic 820 and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers. Additionally, the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements). ASU 2010-06 became effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2010, except for the gross presentation of the Level 3 roll forward, which was required for annual reporting periods beginning July 1, 2011 and for interim reporting periods thereafter. Early application was permitted and comparative disclosures were not required in the period of initial adoption. The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, “Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Loss” (“ASU 2010-20”). ASU 2010-20 amends ASC 310, “Receivables” to enhance disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses by requiring an entity to provide a greater level of disaggregated information and to disclose credit quality indicators, past due information, and modifications of its financing receivables. ASU 2010-20 is effective for interim or annual fiscal years for the Company beginning January 1, 2011. The Company’s adoption of ASU 2010-20 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, “Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor’s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring” (“ASU 2011-02”). ASU 2011-02 provides additional guidance clarifying when the restructuring of a receivable should be considered a troubled debt restructuring. The additional guidance provided by ASU 2011-02 is for determining whether a creditor has granted a concession and whether the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty. ASU 2011-02 also ends the deferral of activity-based disclosures related to troubled debt restructurings. The Company adopted ASU 2011-02 in the third quarter of 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-02 did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs” (“ASU 2011-04”). ASU 2011-04 amends ASC 820, providing a consistent definition and measurement of fair value, as well as similar disclosure requirements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 changes certain fair value measurement principles, clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement and expands the ASC 820 disclosure requirements, particularly for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2011-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 14 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks . All of the Company’s export sales require the customer to make payment in United States dollars. Foreign sales may be affected by the strength of the United States dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which their customers and competitors are located, as well as the strength of the economies of the countries in which the Company’s customers are located. The Company has, at times in the past, paid certain suppliers in Euros. The Company’s bank revolving credit facility contains a $250,000 foreign exchange subfacility for this purpose. The Company had no foreign exchange contracts outstanding at June 30, 2012 and 2011. ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the captions “Risk Factors”. In addition, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Overview Financial Information Concerning Industry Segments Our business is conducted principally in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry segments for the two fiscal years ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 is set forth in the consolidated financial statements which are attached hereto. General At September 29, 2012, we (i) operated 24 units, (excluding the adult entertainment club referenced in (ii) below), consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; (ii) own but do not operate one adult entertainment club; and (iii) franchise an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants, (one of which we operate), and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. Franchised Units . In exchange for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks "Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill" and "Big Daddy's Liquors", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package liquor sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales. 34 Table of Contents Affiliated Limited Partnership Owned Units . We manage and control the operations of the eight restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami, Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner. This new restaurant opened for business on December 27, 2012. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method. Results of Operations REVENUES (in thousands): Fifty Two Fifty Two Weeks Ended Weeks Ended Sept. 29, 2012 Oct. 1, 2011 Sales Restaurant, food $ 48,943 64.9% $ 45,951 64.8% Restaurant, bar 13,255 17.6% 11,814 16.7% Package goods 13,214 17.5% 13,141 18.5% Total 75,412 100.0% 70,906 100.0% Franchise related revenues 1,133 1,023 Owner’s fee 157 161 Other operating income 158 219 Rental income 475 — Total Revenues $ 77,335 $ 72,309 35 Table of Contents Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 29, 2012 and October 1, 2011 Revenues. Total revenue for our fiscal year 2012 increased $5,026,000 or 6 .95 % to $77,335,000 from $72,309,000 for our fiscal year 2011. The increase in total revenue during our fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to revenue generated from the sale of food at our restaurants caused by our increasing our menu prices during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2011 and the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants caused by our increasing our bar liquor prices during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012. Restaurant Food Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled $48,943,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $45,951,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, which consists of eight restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $911,000 and $853,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 6.80%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company owned restaurants only was $405,000 and $370,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 9.46%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $506,000 and $483,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 4.76%. The increase in restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food at restaurants was primarily caused by our increasing menu prices during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2011 and the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012. Restaurant Bar Sales . Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $13,255,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $11,814,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, which consists of eight restaurants owned by us and eight restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships) was $247,000 and $220,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 12.27%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company owned restaurants only was $105,000 and $94,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 11.70%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $142,000 and $126,000 for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively, an increase of 12.70%. The increase in restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants was primarily caused by our increasing our bar liquor prices during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2012. Package Liquor Store Sales . Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $13,214,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $13,141,000 for our fiscal year 2011, an increase of $73,000 or 0.56%. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes all nine (9) Company owned package liquor stores, was $254,000 for our fiscal year 2012 as compared to $253,000 for our fiscal year 2011. 36 Table of Contents Operating Costs and Expenses . Operating costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses), for our fiscal year 2012 increased $4,582,000 or 6.62% to $73,764,000 from $69,182,000 for our fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily due to the costs related to our new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and opened for business on December 27, 2012, the shopping center in Miami, Florida acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and to an expected general increase in food costs, including an increase in the cost of poultry , offset by a decrease in repairs and maintenance to our units and actions taken by management to reduce and/or control costs and expenses. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will continue to increase through our fiscal year 2013 for the same reasons. Operating costs and expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales to approximately 95.38% in our fiscal year 2012 from 95.68% in our fiscal year 2011. Gross Profit . Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales. Restaurant Food and Bar Sales . Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2012 increased to $40,059,000 from $37,857,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 64.41% for our fiscal year 2012 and 65.54% for our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease during our fiscal year 2013 due to higher food costs, including our cost of poultry, offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year 2013. Package Liquor Store Sales . Gross profit for package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2012 decreased to $4,102,000 from $4,381,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our gross profit margin (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales) for package liquor store sales was 31.04% for our fiscal year 2012 and 33.34% for our fiscal year 2011. The decrease in our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales during our fiscal year 2012 (-2.30%) was due to our inability to purchase “close out” and inventory reduction merchandise from wholesalers which we were able to obtain during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year 2013. Payroll and Related Costs . Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2012 increased $1,642,000 or 7.56% to $23,354,000 from $21,712,000 for our fiscal year 2011 due primarily to an increase in the Florida minimum wage (4.92%), which was effective January 1, 2012, and to increases in payroll taxes, including unemployment taxes. We anticipate that our payroll and related costs will increase throughout our fiscal year 2013 due primarily to payroll associated with the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and opened for business on December 27, 2012. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total sales was 30.20% in our fiscal year 2012 and 30.03% of total sales in our fiscal year 2011. Occupancy Costs . Occupancy costs (consisting of rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes and amortization of leasehold interests) for our fiscal year 2012 increased $64,000 or 1.48% to $4,328,000 from $4,264,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Our occupancy costs increased primarily due to increasing percentage rents at various locations and due to rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership, which commenced January 27, 2012, partially offset by the elimination of rent from a limited partnership owned restaurant located in the shopping center in Miami, Florida which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and the elimination of rent paid for our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at 13205 Biscayne Boulevard, North Miami, Florida, the real property and building of which we purchased during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our occupancy costs will remain stable throughout our fiscal year 2013 as rental payments for the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida, will be offset by the reduction in rental payments as a result of our purchase of the building on November 30, 2011 where Store #70 is located. 37 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2012 increased $293,000 or 2.02% to $14,831,000 from $14,538,000 for our fiscal year 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales in our fiscal year 2012 to 19.18% as compared to 20.11% in our fiscal year 2011. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase throughout our fiscal year 2013 due primarily to the new restaurant location in Miami, Florida acquired by a limited partnership during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and opened for business on December 27, 2012, the shopping center acquired during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012 and increases across all categories. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for our fiscal year 2012 decreased $42,000 or 1.63% to $2,528,000 from $2,570,000 for our fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 3.27% of revenue for our fiscal year 2012 and 3.55% of revenue for our fiscal year 2011. Interest Expense, Net . Interest expense for our fiscal year 2012 increased $191,000 to $806,000 from $615,000 for our fiscal year 2011. I nterest expense increased during our fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the interest paid on the $4.5 million mortgage loan, the proceeds of which we used to purchase a shopping center in Miami, Florida and a $1.6 million term loan the proceeds of which were also ultimately used to purchase the shopping center, while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves. Net Income Attributable to Stockholders . Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2012 decreased $36,000 or 2.48% to $1,413,000 from $1,449,000 for our fiscal year 2011. As a percentage of sales, net income for our fiscal year 2012 is 1.83%, as compared to 2.00% in our fiscal year 2011. During our fiscal year 2011, we recognized income of $231,000, offset by income tax of $67,000, from the sale of our interest, as guarantor, of a nine (9) year leasehold interest. Without giving effect to the above non-recurring item, our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2012 would have increased $128,000 or 9.96% to $1,285,000 for our fiscal year 2011. 38 Table of Contents New Limited Partnership Restaurants As new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2012, we recognized pre-opening rent expense in the approximate amount of $83,000 for the Miami, Florida restaurant which opened for business on December 27, 2012. During our fiscal year 2011, we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre-opening rent. We are recognizing rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. During our fiscal year 2012, the limited partnership restaurant in Miami, Florida which opened for business on December 27, 2012, reported losses of $107,000 primarily due to pre-opening costs, thus contributing to a reduction in the operating income for our fiscal year 2012. During our fiscal year 2011, we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre-opening costs. We believe that our current cash on hand, together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. Trends During the next twelve months, we expect that our restaurant food and bar sales will increase , but gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will decrease due to higher food costs, including our cost of poultry, offset by a decrease in our cost of ribs during calendar year 2013. We anticipate that our package liquor store sales and gross profit margin for package liquor store sales will stabilize during our fiscal year 2013. We expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income. W e also plan to continue our increased advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition. With our recent menu price increases, we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible, but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses, which will adversely affect our net income. We may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible. We currently have a new restaurant in the development stage, which opened for business on December 27, 2012 using our limited partnership ownership model. We continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business. Any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model. We are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores, but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available, we will consider it. Liquidity and Capital Resources We fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations. As of September 29, 2012, we had cash of approximately $7,221,000, an increase of $2,957,000 from our cash balance of $4,264,000 as of October 1, 2011. The increase in cash as of September 29, 2012 was primarily due to a balance of $1,306,000 of net proceeds from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami, Florida restaurant and opened for business on December 27, 2012. Management believes that the Company’s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. 39 Table of Contents Cash Flows Fiscal Years 2012 2011 (in thousands) Net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities $ 6,212 $ 4,352 Net cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities (2,030 ) (4,172 ) Net cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities (1,225 ) (2,363 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents 2,957 (2,183 ) Cash and equivalents, beginning of year 4,264 6,447 Cash and equivalents, end of year $ 7,221 $ 4,264 Capital Expenditures In addition to using cash for our operating expenses, we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. We acquired property and equipment of $7,800,000, (including $6,100,000 of which was financed and $30,000 of deposits recorded in other assets as of October 1, 2011), during our fiscal year 2012, including $507,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant and three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2011, we acquired property and equipment of $4,586,000, (including $122,000 of which was financed and $28,000 of deposits recorded in other assets as of October 1, 2010), during our fiscal year 2011, including $1,261,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant. All of our owned units require periodic refurbishing in order to remain competitive. The cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year 2012 was $507,000 for renovations to one (1) existing Company owned restaurant and for renovations to three (3) limited partnership owned restaurants. We anticipate the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year 2013 will be approximately $850,000, which funds will be provided from operations. 40 Table of Contents Debt As of the end of our fiscal year 2012, we had debt of $13,418,000, as compared to $8,757,000 as of the end of our fiscal year 2011. As of September 29, 2012, we are in compliance with the covenants of all loans with our lender. We repaid long term debt, including auto loans, financed insurance premiums and mortgages in the amount of $1,859,000 and $1,350,000 in our fiscal years 2012 and 2011, respectively. Financed Insurance Premiums (i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2010, our property insurance is a three (3) year policy with our insurance carrier. The three (3) year property insurance premium is in the amount of $894,000, of which $727,000 is financed through an unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement provides that we are obligated to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 4.89% per annum, over 30 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of approximately $25,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof. (ii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2011, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including automobile and excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $286,000, of which $250,000 was financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligated us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 3.19% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $25,000. The finance agreement was secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof.

The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $356,000, of which $297,000 was financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligated us to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 3.19% per annum, over 9 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $30,000 and was paid in full during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2012. The finance agreement was secured by a security agreement in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof. (iv) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2012, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including automobile and excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including automobile and excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $309,000, of which $282,000 is financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed together with interest at the rate of 3.29% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $29,000. The finance agreement is secured by a security interest in all insurance policies, all unearned premium, return premium, dividend payments and loss payments thereof. 41 Table of Contents (v) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2012, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers, including excess liability coverage. The one (1) year general liability insurance premiums, including excess liability coverage, total, in the aggregate $390,000, of which $356,000 is financed through the same unaffiliated third party lender. The finance agreement obligates us to repay the amounts financed, together with interest at the rate of 3.29% per annum, over 10 months, with monthly payments of principal and interest, each in the amount of $36,000.

As of September 29, 2012, the aggregate principal balance owed from the financing of our property and general liability insurance policies is $333,000. Purchase Commitments In order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants, on September 19, 2012, we entered into a purchase agreement with a new rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $3,800,000 of baby back ribs during calendar year 2013 from this vendor at a fixed cost. While we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed. Purchase of Limited Partnership Interests During our fiscal year 2012, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 0.18% in one (1) limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of $3,000. During our fiscal year 2011, we purchased from one limited partner (who is not an officer, director or family member of officers or directors) a limited partnership interest of 1.06% in one (1) limited partnership which owns a restaurant for an aggregate purchase price of $17,000. Working capital The table below summarizes our current assets, current liabilities and working capital for our fiscal years 2012 and 2011: 42 Table of Contents Sept. 29 Oct. 1 (in thousands) 2012 2011 Current assets $ 11,433 $ 8,293 Current liabilities 8,283 6,473 Working capital 3,150 1,820 Our working capital as of September 29, 2012 increased by 73.13% from working capital as of October 1, 2011. Our working capital increased during our fiscal year 2012 from our working capital for our fiscal year ended October 1, 2011 primarily due to the net funds ($1,306,000) remaining from the private sale of limited partnership interests by the affiliated limited partnership which owns the new Miami, Florida restaurant. While there can be no assurance due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year 2013, including payment for a new point of sale system for our restaurants ($415,000). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year 2012 or our fiscal year 2011. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment The estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. 43 Table of Contents Consolidation of Limited Partnerships As of September 29, 2012, we operate eight (8) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We currently have one restaurant under development in Miami, Florida which will result in us operating the restaurant as general partner. This new restaurant opened for business on December 27, 2012. Additionally, we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening additional new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from 5% to 48% of the total units outstanding. As a result of these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of 50% of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The noncontrolling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share. Income Taxes FASB ASC Topic 740 – Income Taxes , requires, among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2012. Other Matters Impact of Inflation The primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. To date, inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results, but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise. 44 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 9 “Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage these risks. These instruments are not used for speculative purposes but are used to modify variable rate obligations into fixed rate obligations. At September 29, 2012, we had four variable rate debt instruments outstanding that are impacted by changes in interest rates. In July, 2010, we converted the amount outstanding on our line of credit ($1,586,000) to a term loan (the “Term Loan”) and we also re-financed the mortgage loan encumbering our corporate offices (the “Refinanced Mortgage Loan”). In November, 2011, we financed our purchase of the real property and two building shopping center in Miami, Florida, with a $4,500,000 mortgage loan (the “$4.5M Mortgage Loan”), and received a $1,600,000 term loan (the “$1.6M Term Loan”) the proceeds of which were ultimately used to purchase the shopping center, while permitting us to retain our working capital and cash reserves. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on these debt instruments, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with our unrelated third party lender to convert these variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. We are currently party to the following four (4) interest rate swap agreements: (i) One (1) interest rate swap agreement entered into in July, 2010 relates to the Term Loan, (the “Term Loan Swap”), which converts the LIBOR based variable rate interest to a fixed rate. The Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a three (3) year period at a fixed rate of 4.55% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $1,586,000, while receiving interest for the same period at the British Bankers Association LIBOR (“LIBOR”), Daily Floating Rate, plus 3.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. Under this method of accounting, at September 29, 2012, we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender, t he fair value of the Term Loan Swap was not significant; and (ii) The second interest rate swap agreement entered into July, 2010 relates to the Refinanced Mortgage Loan (the “Mortgage Loan Swap”). The Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a seven (7) year period at a fixed rate of 5.11% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $935,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR, Daily Floating Rate, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. Under this method of accounting, at September 29, 2012, we determined that based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities provided by our unrelated third party lender, t he fair value of the Mortgage Loan Swap was not significant; and (iii) The third interest rate swap agreement entered into in November, 2011 by our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigan’s Calusa Center, LLC, relates to the $4.5 Mortgage Loan (the “$4.5M Mortgage Loan Swap”). The $4.5M Mortgage Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for an eight (8) year period at a fixed rate of 4.51% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $3,750,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR – 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at September 29, 2012, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material; and 45 Table of Contents (iv) The fourth interest rate swap agreement entered into in November, 2011 relates to the $1.6M Term Loan (the “$1.6M Term Loan Swap”). The $1.6M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a four (4) year period at a fixed rate of 3.43% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $1,600,000, while receiving interest for the same period at LIBOR – 1 Month, plus 2.25%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. We determined that at September 29, 2012, the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and the fair value was not material. At September 29, 2012, our cash resources earn interest at variable rates. Accordingly, our return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. There is no assurance that interest rates will increase or decrease over our next fiscal year or that an increase will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. ]]></c>

All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. In third quarter 2011, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock, distributed October 3, 2011 in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. All shares and per share amounts in this Annual Report have been adjusted for all periods presented for the stock split. For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders' Equity" to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 34 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, the Company's management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, U.S. pension and other post-employment benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, income taxes, and purchase accounting. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company believes, based on historical results, the likelihood of actual write-offs having a material impact on financial results is low. However, if one of the Company's key customers was to file for bankruptcy, or otherwise be unwilling or unable to make its required payments, or there was a significant slow-down in the economy, the Company could increase its allowances. This could result in a material charge to earnings. The Company's allowances were $8 million and $5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recorded for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. The Company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in third quarter of each year, unless events warrant more frequent testing. Reporting units are identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value, as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than their carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill, additional steps, including an allocation of the estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, would be necessary to determine the amount, if any, of goodwill impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the Coatings, Adhesives, Specialty Polymers and Inks ("CASPI") and Performance Chemicals and Intermediates ("PCI") segments. The Company also had recorded goodwill and other intangibles associated with the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. In fourth quarter 2009, the Company announced the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, which resulted in an impairment of the Beaumont industrial gasification project goodwill and other intangible assets. As the Company's assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change, additional write-downs may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings. The Company recognized a definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $8 million resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting the fair value of air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas, industrial gasification project. The Company recognized fixed (tangible) asset impairment charges of $133 million and goodwill and definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $46 million in results from continuing operations during 2009, related to the discontinuance of the Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. 35 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Environmental Costs The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also establishes reserves for closure/postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets, as defined by GAAP, include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, the Company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to 50 years. If the Company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The Company's reserve, including the above remediation, was $39 million at December 31, 2011 and $40 million at December 31, 2010, representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets' estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs. Pension and Other Post-employment Benefits The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Additionally, Eastman provides a subsidy toward life insurance, health care, and dental benefits for eligible retirees and a subsidy toward health care and dental benefits for retirees' eligible survivors. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company's assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates) and expected return on plan assets. In connection with its acquisition of Sterling Chemicals, Inc. ("Sterling") in 2011, the Company assumed Sterling's U.S. pension plans. At December 31, 2011, the Company assumed discount rates of 4.88 percent and 4.83 percent on the defined benefit pension plans, respectively, and an expected return on plan assets of 8.75 percent and 5.50 percent, respectively. The Company assumed a discount rate of 5.00 percent on its other post-employment benefit plan. The cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation. 36 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The December 31, 2011 projected benefit obligation and 2012 expense are affected by year-end 2011 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for all U.S. pension plans and other postretirement welfare plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. Change in Assumption Impact on 2012 Pre-tax U.S. Benefits Expense Impact on December 31, 2011 Projected Benefit Obligation for U.S. Pension Plans Impact on December 31, 2011 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation for Other U.S. Postretirement Plans 25 basis point decrease in discount rate +$6 Million +$49 Million +$27 Million 25 basis point increase in discount rate -$6 Million -$47 Million -$26 Million 25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets +$3 Million No Impact N/A 25 basis point increase in expected return on assets -$3 Million No Impact N/A The expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the Company's pension and other post-employment benefit obligations are established each December 31. The expected return on assets is based upon the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds, primarily the domestic, international, private equity, and real estate markets. Historically, over a ten year period, excluding 2008 which is considered an anomaly due to the global recession, the Company's average achieved actual return has been near the expected return on assets. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post-employment benefit obligations. As future benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations. The Company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets, which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years. If actual experience differs from these long-term assumptions, the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain (loss) and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period, which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease. The charges applied to earnings in 2011, 2010, and 2009 due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses, largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates, were $69 million, $56 million, and $45 million, respectively. 37 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post-employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during 2012 will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during 2012. However, an after-tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity, as of December 31, 2012 for the impact on the pension's projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates, if any. While the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirement, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other post-employment obligations, see Note 13, "Retirement Plans ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities From time to time, the Company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon facts and information currently available, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against earnings in particular periods. Income Taxes The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome from future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position. As of December 31, 2011, a valuation allowance of $42 million has been provided against the deferred tax assets. The Company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision. Purchase Accounting In general, the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. The Company estimates fair value using the exit price approach which is defined as the price that would be received if we sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The value of an exit price is determined from the viewpoint of all market participants as a whole and may result in the Company valuing assets at a fair value that is not reflective of our intended use of the assets. Any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets. Management's judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives for property, plant and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, and can materially affect the Company's results of operations. 38 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTATION OF NON- GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following non-GAAP financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. · Company and segment operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains described below; · Company earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs described below; · Cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the impact of a tax payment for the gain on the sale of the polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") business, described below; and · Free cash flow (as defined), described below. During 2011, the Company recognized $7 million in restructuring charges primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling and a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. Also during 2011, cash flows included the use of $110 million for a tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. During 2010, the Company recognized $29 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges consisting of $20 million in severance and pension curtailment, $8 million for an intangible asset impairment resulting from an environmental regulatory change during fourth quarter 2010 impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project, and $1 million of additional site closure charges. During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring including the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. During first quarter 2010, the Company adopted amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's $200 million accounts receivable securitization program. For periods beginning after December 31, 2009, transfers of receivables interests that were previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet are included in trade receivables, net, and reflected as secured borrowings on the balance sheet. The Company's Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2010 reflects an increase in trade receivables of $200 million, the amount transferred at December 31, 2009 under the securitization program, which reduced cash flows from operating activities by that amount for 2010. During 2009, the Company recognized $196 million in asset impairments and restructuring charges, primarily consisting of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Company's previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. 39 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and the impact on the Company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs, to improve the profitability of the Company, and favorably adjust its debt maturities and cost, Eastman's management believes that Company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains and early debt extinguishment costs. Management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported Company and segment results, respectively, without the identified items. In addition, management believes that cash provided by and used in operating activities should be considered both with and without the impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets and the tax payment for the gain on the sale of the PET business, and dividends and capital expenditures. Management utilizes Company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance-based compensation. These measures, excluding the identified items, are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to the GAAP measures of performance. 2011 OVERVIEW The Company generated sales revenue of $7.2 billion and $5.8 billion for 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sales revenue increases were primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end-use demand primarily for CASPI segment products. The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique Specialties Corporation ("Genovique") plasticizer product lines. Operating earnings were $1,021 million in 2011 compared to $862 million in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, described above in " Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ", operating earnings increased primarily due to higher selling prices which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year. Operating earnings in 2011 also included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. Earnings from continuing operations were $657 million in 2011 compared to $425 million in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings from continuing operations were $652 million and $514 million, respectively. Earnings from continuing operations were $4.59 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $2.88 per diluted share in 2010. Excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, and early debt extinguishment costs, earnings were $4.56 per diluted share and $3.48 per diluted share, respectively. Eastman generated $625 million in cash from operating activities in 2011, including $102 million in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans and the $110 million tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the tax payment and the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets described above in " Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ", cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million to $735 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Excluding the tax payment, the Company generated free cash flow of $142 million for full year 2011. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends. 40 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2011 and early 2012, the Company completed and progressed on both organic (internal growth) and inorganic (external growth through joint venture and acquisition) growth initiatives: · In the PCI segment, the Company completed several initiatives in 2011 to expand its non-phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex do Brasil S.A. Indústrias Químicas ("Scandiflex"). The acquired Sterling idled plasticizer manufacturing unit is being retrofitted to produce non-phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012. The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2-ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. · In the Specialty Plastics segment, the Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for Tritan TM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. The Company is expanding its capacity for cyclohexane dimethanol ("CHDM"), a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. · In the CASPI segment, the Company completed an additional 20 percent expansion of its hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity in Middelburg, the Netherlands, and an additional 10 percent debottleneck of the hydrogenated hydrocarbon facility in Longview, Texas in 2011. The Company also acquired Dynaloy, LLC ("Dynaloy") in 2011 as part of its electronic materials growth initiative. · In the Fibers segment, in 2011 the Company entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China, expected to be operational in mid-2013. · The Company continues to explore and invest in research and development ("R&D") initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally-friendly chemistry. These initiatives include the completion of a demonstration facility for market testing of acetylated wood, branded as Perennial Wood TM , in second half 2011 and commercial introduction in first quarter 2012 to select markets; the initial commercial introduction of the new Eastman Cerfis TM technology, with anticipation that the application will be expanded nationwide by the end of 2012; and the announcement of the new Eastman TM microfiber technology. · On January 26, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia Inc. ("Solutia"), a global leader in performance materials and specialty chemicals. Under the terms of the agreement, Solutia stockholders will receive $22.00 in cash and 0.12 shares of Eastman common stock for each share of Solutia common stock, a total transaction value of approximately $4.7 billion, as of January 26, 2012, including the assumption of Solutia's debt. The transaction remains subject to approval by Solutia's shareholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals as well as other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2012. The acquisition of Solutia is expected to: o broaden Eastman's global presence, particularly in Asia Pacific; o establish a combined platform with extensive organic growth opportunities through complementary technologies and business capabilities and an overlap of key end-markets; and o expand Eastman's portfolio of sustainable products. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP. The total cash proceeds of the transaction were $615 million. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company's results of operations as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report are summarized and analyzed below. 41 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 % 2010 2009 % Sales $ 7,178 $ 5,842 23 % $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % Volume effect 7 % 19 % Price effect 14 % 10 % Product mix effect 2 % 4 % Exchange rate effect -- % -- % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 increased $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments (particularly in the PCI segment) and higher sales volume primarily in the PCI segment. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily for propane, paraxylene, and wood pulp. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in PCI segment plasticizer product lines, the fourth quarter 2010 restart of a previously idled olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility, and strengthened end-use demand primarily for CASPI segment products. The increase was also due to growth initiatives including the increased utilization of the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility and the Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line, and the acquisition of the Genovique plasticizer product lines. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 increased $1.4 billion. The sales revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in all segments attributed to improved end-use demand in packaging, durable goods, and other markets, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives. Sales revenue increases were also due to higher selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs, primarily in the PCI and CASPI segments. 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Gross Profit $ 1,640 $ 1,474 11 % $ 1,474 $ 1,032 43 % As a percentage of sales 23 % 25 % 25 % 23 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Gross profit for 2011 increased compared with 2010 in all segments. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs, and higher sales volume and increased capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, particularly in the first half of the year. Gross profit in 2011 included $17 million of costs from an unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. 42 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 Gross profit for 2010 increased compared with 2009 in all segments. The increase was due to higher sales volume and higher capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. In addition, higher selling prices more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Gross profit in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. In first quarter 2010, the Company experienced a power outage at its Longview, Texas manufacturing facility. Costs related to the outage were mostly offset by the settlement of the related insurance claim. Gross profit in 2009 included approximately $20 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The reconfiguration costs impacted the PCI and CASPI segments. 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 ( Dollars in millions ) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Selling, General and Administrative Expenses $ 469 $ 431 9 % $ 431 $ 367 17 % Research and Development Expenses 158 152 4 % 152 124 23 % $ 627 $ 583 8 % $ 583 $ 491 19 % As a percentage of sales 9 % 10 % 10 % 11 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased compensation expense and higher costs of growth and business development initiatives. Research and development expenses increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. 2010 Compared to 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased performance-based compensation expense and higher discretionary spending, including expenses for growth initiatives. Research and development expenses increased for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher R&D expenses for growth initiatives. Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges (Gains), Net In 2011, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net gains of $8 million. A gain of $15 million was recognized from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and restructuring charges of $7 million were primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling. In 2010, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $29 million and consisted primarily of severance and pension curtailment charges and an intangible asset impairment. Severance charges of $18 million included $15 million for the previously announced voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010 and $3 million primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Genovique in second quarter 2010. Restructuring charges of $2 million for pension curtailment are also related to the voluntary separation program in fourth quarter 2010. The intangible asset impairment of $8 million resulted from an environmental regulatory change impacting air emission credits remaining from the previously discontinued Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project in fourth quarter 2010. 43 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In 2009, asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains were net charges of $196 million and consisted of $179 million in asset impairments related to the Company's previously announced discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project and $19 million, net, for severance resulting from a reduction in force. For more information regarding asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, primarily related to recent strategic decisions and actions, see Note 18, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges (Gains), Net ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

For 2012, the Company expects net interest expense to remain consistent with 2011, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia. 2010 Compared to 2009 Net interest expense increased $21 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower capitalized interest resulting from lower capital spending and higher average borrowings. Early Debt Extinguishment Costs During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new debt securities with maturities five and ten years from issuance and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long-term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. For additional information regarding the early extinguishment costs, see Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 44 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other Charges (Income), Net (Dollars in millions ) 2011 2010 2009 Foreign exchange transaction (gains) losses, net $ (2 ) $ 8 $ 5 Investment (gains) losses, net (16 ) (1 ) 5 Other, net (1 ) 5 3 Other charges (income), net $ (19 ) $ 12 $ 13 Included in other charges (income), net are gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions, results from equity investments, gains or losses on business venture investments, gains from the sale of non-operating assets, certain litigation costs, fees on securitized receivables, other non-operating income, and other miscellaneous items. Investment gains in 2011 included increased earnings from the Nanjing, China joint venture and sales of business venture investments. Provision for Income Taxes from Continuing Operations 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 (Dollars in millions ) 2011 2010 Change 2010 2009 Change Provision for income taxes from continuing operations $ 307 $ 211 45 % $ 211 $ 100 >100 % Effective tax rate 32 % 33 % 33 % 39 % The 2011 effective tax rate reflects an $8 million tax benefit recognized due to an increased level of capital investment which qualified for additional state tax credits. The 2010 effective tax rate reflected a $9 million tax charge associated with a nondeductible, early distribution under the executive deferred compensation plan of previously earned compensation as a result of certain participants electing early withdrawal. The 2009 effective tax rate reflected an $11 million tax charge associated with the recapture of gasification investment tax credits, a $7 million tax charge associated with a change in accounting method for tax purposes to accelerate timing of deductions for manufacturing repairs expense and a $5 million tax benefit from the reversal of tax reserves due to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations. The Company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be approximately 33 percent, excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia. 45 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings per Share 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 657 $ 4.59 $ 425 $ 2.88 $ 154 $ 1.05 Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net of tax (5 ) (0.03 ) 18 0.12 127 0.86 Early debt extinguishment costs, net of tax -- -- 71 0.48 -- -- Earnings from continuing operations excluding items $ 652 $ 4.56 $ 514 $ 3.48 $ 281 $ 1.91 Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share 2011 2010 2009 (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) $ EPS $ EPS $ EPS Earnings from continuing operations $ 657 $ 4.59 $ 425 $ 2.88 $ 154 $ 1.05 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 8 0.06 13 0.08 (18 ) (0.12 ) Gain from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax 31 0.21 -- -- -- -- Net earnings $ 696 $ 4.86 $ 438 $ 2.96 $ 136 $ 0.93 Earnings of $8 million and $13 million and a loss of $18 million, net of tax in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, resulted from discontinued operations of the PET business of the Performance Polymers segment. Corporate costs which were allocated to the Performance Polymers segment have been reallocated to other segments in the Company's financial statements. For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT The Company's products and operations are currently managed and reported in four reportable operating segments, consisting of the CASPI segment, the Fibers segment, the PCI segment, and the Specialty Plastics segment. For additional information concerning the Company's operating businesses and products, see Note 22, "Segment Information ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In first quarter 2011, the Company completed the sale of the PET business, related assets at the Columbia, South Carolina site, and technology of its Performance Polymers segment. The PET business, assets, and technology sold were substantially all of the Performance Polymers segment. Performance Polymers segment operating results are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are therefore not included in results from continuing operations in accordance with GAAP. For additional information, see Note 3, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 46 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Sales revenue and expenses not identifiable to an operating segment are not included in segment operating results for either of the periods presented and are shown in Note 22, "Segment Information ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, as "other" sales revenue and operating losses. As discussed in Note 22, these "other" operating losses are $50 million, $66 million, and $218 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Included in 2011 is a $15 million gain from the sale of the previously impaired methanol and ammonia assets related to the terminated Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. Included in 2010 and 2009 are $8 million and $179 million, respectively, in asset impairments related to the discontinuance of its Beaumont, Texas industrial gasification project. CASPI Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,844 $ 1,574 $ 270 17 % $ 1,574 $ 1,217 $ 357 29 % Volume effect 79 5 % 198 16 % Price effect 197 13 % 122 10 % Product mix effect (11) (1) % 43 4 % Exchange rate effect 5 -- % (6) (1) % Operating earnings 331 293 38 13 % 293 221 72 33 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net -- 6 (6) 6 3 3 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 331 299 32 11 % 299 224 75 34 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volume. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs and were also attributed to strengthened demand, particularly in the U.S., and tight industry supply particularly in the first half of the year. The higher sales volume was attributed primarily to strengthened end-use demand in the packaging, durable goods, and transportation markets, particularly in the U.S. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices, higher sales volume, and the increased benefits from cracking propane to produce low-cost propylene, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. In 2011, operating earnings included $5 million of costs from the unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit. The restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 47 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume was attributed to strengthened end-use demand in the packaging and transportation markets primarily in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa and the United States and Canada regions, in part due to the recovery in the global economy, and the positive impact of growth initiatives, including the hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins manufacturing capacity expansion in Middelburg, the Netherlands which was completed in fourth quarter 2009. The higher selling prices were primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for propane. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, higher capacity utilization, which led to lower unit costs, and higher selling prices, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. Operating earnings in 2009 included approximately $5 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. Growth Initiatives The Company is progressing on both organic and inorganic growth initiatives in the CASPI segment. The segment is meeting growing demand for specialty hydrocarbon resins by completing two capacity expansions in 2011: an additional expansion in Middelburg, the Netherlands and a debottleneck in Longview, Texas. In 2011, CASPI expanded its presence in the electronic materials market through the acquisition of Dynaloy and its formulated cleaners business. Fibers Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,279 $ 1,142 $ 137 12 % $ 1,142 $ 1,032 $ 110 11 % Volume effect 35 3 % 61 6 % Price effect 46 4 % 4 -- % Product mix effect 55 5 % 46 5 % Exchange rate effect 1 -- % (1) -- % Operating earnings 346 323 23 7 % 323 292 31 11 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net -- 3 (3) 3 4 (1) Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 346 326 20 6 % 326 296 30 10 % 48 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to a favorable shift in product mix, higher selling prices, and higher sales volume. The favorable shift in product mix was mainly due to higher acetate tow sales volume resulting from increased utilization of the recently completed acetate tow manufacturing facility in Korea. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for wood pulp. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher acetate tow sales volume in Asia Pacific and Europe and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. The restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and a favorable shift in product mix. The higher sales volume and favorable shift in product mix were due to higher sales volume of acetate tow and of acetate yarn, both attributed to strengthened demand due to the global economic recovery. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume for acetate tow and acetate yarn, improved acetyl stream capacity utilization and a favorable shift in product mix. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. Growth Initiatives The Company has entered into a joint venture for a 30,000 metric ton acetate tow manufacturing facility in China. The facility is expected to be operational in mid-2013. Eastman has 45 percent ownership of the joint venture and expects to provide 100 percent of the acetate flake raw material to the joint venture from the Company's manufacturing facility in Kingsport. During first quarter 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of and commenced production at the Korean acetate tow manufacturing facility. The facility was operating at full production beginning in fourth quarter 2010.

The increased selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs and also attributed to strengthened demand in North America and tight industry supply, particularly for olefin-derivative product lines in the first half of the year. The higher sales volume was primarily due to growth in plasticizer product lines, which included the acquired Genovique plasticizer product lines, particularly in North America and Europe, and the restart of the previously idled Longview, Texas olefins cracking unit. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2011 increased compared to 2010 due to higher selling prices, higher sales volume, and the increased benefits from cracking propane to produce low-cost propylene, which more than offset higher raw material and energy costs. The operating earnings increase was primarily in North America. In 2011, operating earnings included $8 million from the acetyl technology license and costs of $11 million from the unplanned outage of an olefins cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility. In 2010, operating earnings included $12 million from the acetyl technology license. In 2011, operating earnings included $7 million in restructuring charges, primarily for severance associated with the acquisition and integration of Sterling. In 2010, the restructuring charges reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume and higher selling prices. The higher sales volume included growth in plasticizer product lines, both in heritage products as well as in product lines added with the acquisition of Genovique plasticizer product lines, and also attributed to strengthened end-use demand due to the global economic recovery. The higher selling prices were in response to higher raw material and energy costs. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings in 2010 increased compared to 2009 due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs, higher sales volume, and increased capacity utilization which led to lower unit costs. Operating earnings in 2010 also included $12 million from acetyl license revenue. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. Operating results in 2009 included approximately $15 million in costs related to the reconfiguration of the Longview, Texas facility. Growth Initiatives The Company completed several initiatives to expand its non-phthalate plasticizer business, including the acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010. In third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Sterling, a single site North American petrochemical producer. The acquisition of Sterling will allow an idled plasticizer unit to be retrofitted to produce non-phthalate plasticizers, with the first of two phases expected to be online in the first half of 2012 and the second phase to be determined at a later date based on demand. Also, in third quarter 2011, the Company acquired Scandiflex, a manufacturer of plasticizers located in São Paulo, Brazil. In second quarter 2010, the Company acquired Genovique, a global producer of specialty non-phthalate plasticizers for water-based adhesives and other applications. The acquisitions of Sterling and Scandiflex in 2011 and Genovique in 2010 added to the Company's portfolio of non-phthalate plasticizers that serve high growth markets. The Company also plans to increase capacity of 2-ethyl hexanol in first half 2012 to support expected growth in the plasticizers, coatings, and fuel additive markets. To further improve its competitive cost position over purchasing olefins in the North American market, the Company restarted a previously idled cracking unit at the Longview, Texas facility in 2010. This restart was prompted by a favorable shift in market conditions for olefins raw materials that is expected to continue over the next several years. The Company has three operating cracking units as well as a fourth cracking unit which is currently shutdown. 50 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Specialty Plastics Segment 2011 Compared to 2010 2010 Compared to 2009 Change Change (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 $ % 2010 2009 $ % Sales $ 1,195 $ 1,043 $ 152 15 % $ 1,043 $ 749 $ 294 39 % Volume effect (23) (2) % 240 32 % Price effect 161 16 % 14 2 % Product mix effect 11 1 % 37 5 % Exchange rate effect 3 -- % 3 -- % Operating earnings 105 88 17 19 % 88 9 79 >100 % Asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net -- 5 (5) 5 4 1 Operating earnings excluding asset impairments and restructuring charges (gains), net 105 93 12 13 % 93 13 80 >100 % 2011 Compared to 2010 Sales revenue for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices. Selling prices increased primarily in response to higher raw material and energy costs, particularly for paraxylene. Slightly lower sales volume was attributed to weakened demand for copolyester product lines, particularly in packaging and consumer durable goods end markets, and some customer shift to other plastic materials that do not use paraxylene as a raw material. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices more than offsetting higher raw material and energy costs and the positive impact of the Eastman Tritan™ copolyester growth initiative. Restructuring charges for 2010 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 2010 Compared to 2009 Sales revenue for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume. The higher sales volume was attributed to improved end-use demand across all markets, in part due to the global economic recovery, as well as the positive impact of growth initiatives for core copolyesters and the Tritan TM copolyester product lines. Excluding restructuring charges, operating earnings for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volume, resulting in higher capacity utilization and lower unit costs. The restructuring charges for 2010 and 2009 reflect the segment's portion of severance charges. 51 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Initiatives The Company is adding another 30,000 metric tons of resin capacity at its facility in Kingsport, Tennessee for Tritan TM copolyester polymer, which is expected to be operational in early 2012. The Company is expanding its capacity for CHDM, a monomer used in the manufacture of copolyesters, in two phases with the first operational in fourth quarter 2011 and the second expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. The Company is also expanding its cellulose triacetate capacity, with the new capacity expected to be operational in first quarter 2012. Eastman expects that the overall segment decrease in sales volume, particularly in second half 2011, is a temporary slowdown and expects growth to resume in the long-term. The monomer manufacturing facility and the first Eastman Tritan TM copolyester resin manufacturing line in Kingsport, Tennessee commenced production in first quarter 2010.

Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments, and a favorable shift in product mix and higher sales volume, primarily in the Fibers segment. The sales volume increase was less than other regions due to lower sales volume in the Specialty Plastics segment offsetting increases in the other segments. Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices in all segments and higher sales volume, particularly in the PCI segment. Sales revenue in Latin America increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher selling prices, particularly in the PCI and CASPI segments. Lower sales volume was primarily due to sales being directed to other regions. With a substantial portion of sales to customers outside the United States, Eastman is subject to the risks associated with operating in international markets. To mitigate its exchange rate risks, the Company frequently seeks to negotiate payment terms in U.S. dollars or euros. In addition, where it deems such actions advisable, the Company engages in foreign currency hedging transactions and requires letters of credit and prepayment for shipments where its assessment of individual customer and country risks indicates their use is appropriate. For additional information concerning these practices, see Note 12, "Derivatives ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Part II, Item 7A--"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ." 52 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY BY CUSTOMER LOCATION – 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 Sales Revenue (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 Change Volume Effect Price Effect Product Mix Effect Exchange Rate Effect United States and Canada $ 2,957 $ 2,252 31 % 19 % 12 % -- % -- % Asia Pacific 1,446 1,062 36 % 18 % 10 % 7 % 1 % Europe, Middle East, and Africa 1,150 835 38 % 23 % 5 % 12 % (2) % Latin America 289 247 17 % 9 % 7 % 1 % -- % $ 5,842 $ 4,396 33 % 19 % 10 % 4 % -- % Sales revenue in the United States and Canada increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher sales volumes in all segments, particularly the PCI segment, and higher selling prices in all segments except the Fibers segment.

LIQUIDITY , CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION Cash Flows (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758 Investing activities (142) (442) (369) Financing activities (423) (411) 18 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 1 (1) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 61 $ (277) $ 406 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 577 $ 516 $ 793 53 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 625 $ 575 $ 758 Impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance (1) -- 200 -- Impact of tax payment on the sale of the PET business (2) 110 -- -- Net cash provided by operating activities excluding items 735 775 758 Additions to properties and equipment (457) (243) (310) Dividends paid to stockholders (136) (127) (128) Free Cash Flow $ 142 $ 405 $ 320 (1) Net cash provided by operating activities in 2010 reflected the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which resulted in $200 million of receivables, which were previously accounted for as sold and removed from the balance sheet when transferred under the accounts receivable securitization program, being included on the 2010 balance sheet as trade receivables, net. This increase in receivables reduced cash from operations by $200 million in first quarter 2010. (2) Net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 included the use of $110 million for the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011. Excluding the impact of the tax payment for the tax gain on the sale of the PET business completed in first quarter 2011 and the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program in 2010, cash provided by operating activities decreased $40 million in 2011 compared with 2010. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in working capital and higher cash payments for employee pension and incentive pay plans during the year, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Working capital increased primarily due to increased inventory primarily as a result of increased raw material costs, increased accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales revenue, and decreased accounts payable primarily due to decreased raw material purchases due to lower sales volume near year-end. Excluding the impact of the adoption of amended accounting guidance for transfers of financial assets which impacts the financial statement presentation for activity under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program, cash provided by operating activities increased $17 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to significantly higher net earnings, offset by an increase in working capital and the inclusion in operating cash flow in 2009 of a benefit generated by a change in the tax method for capitalizing assets. Working capital increased due to increased trade receivables primarily attributed to strong sales revenues throughout the year and increased inventories due to higher quantities attributed to improved demand for the Company's products and higher costs. Both the increase in receivables and inventory were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable driven by a higher level of purchasing activity. Cash used in investing activities decreased $300 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily related to the receipt of $615 million from the sale of the PET business offsetting investment of $200 million in short-term time deposits having staggered maturities between three and ten months at the investment date and higher capital expenditures, as well as slightly lower payments for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures. Cash used in investing activities increased $73 million in 2010. The increase was primarily related to higher cash outflows for acquisitions and investments in joint ventures, including the acquisition of Genovique and the Korean acetate tow facility, which more than offset lower capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities increased $12 million in 2011. Higher cash outflows for share repurchases and dividends and lower proceeds from borrowings and stock option exercises and other items were mostly offset by significantly lower cash outflows for repayment of borrowings. 54 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The increase in cash used in financing activities of $429 million in 2010 was primarily related to higher cash outflows for repayment of borrowings, including for early repayment of $500 million principal amount of outstanding long term debt, and share repurchases, which more than offset higher cash receipts for proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from stock option exercises and other items. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, in 2012, the Company expects to generate positive free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends) of between $250 million and $300 million, capital expenditures of between $400 million and $425 million, and U.S. defined benefit pension plan funding of $100 million. Assuming the acquisition of Solutia mid-2012, the priorities for uses of available cash in 2012 are expected to be payment of the quarterly cash dividend, repayment of debt, pension funding, and funding targeted growth initiatives. Liquidity The Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits as follows: (Dollars in millions) December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 577 $ 516 $ 793 Short-term time deposits 200 -- -- Total cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits (1) $ 777 $ 516 $ 793 (1) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term time deposits are primarily held in the United States. In addition, at December 31, 2011, the Company had access to the sources of liquidity described below. In December 2011, the Company entered into a $750 million revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") expiring December 2016. The Credit Facility replaces, and has terms substantially similar to, the $700 million revolving credit agreement entered into in April 2006 (the "Prior Credit Facility") which was terminated concurrently with the entry into the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. In addition, the Credit Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including required maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, and at December 31, 2010, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Facility. The Credit Facility provides liquidity support for commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes. Accordingly, any outstanding commercial paper borrowings reduce capacity for borrowings available under the Credit Facility. Given the expiration date of the Credit Facility, any commercial paper borrowings supported by the Credit Facility are classified as long-term borrowings because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance such borrowings on a long-term basis. Additionally, at December 31, 2011, the Company also had a $200 million line of credit under its annually renewable accounts receivable securitization agreement ("A/R Facility"). The A/R Facility was renewed in July 2011. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and the Company pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. In addition, the A/R Facility contains a number of customary covenants and events of default, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants for all periods presented. At December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the A/R Facility. For more information, see Note 10, "Borrowings " and Note 14, "Commitments ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 55 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS During fourth quarter 2010, the Company completed a public debt restructuring comprised of the sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of new five and ten year debt securities and the early repayment of $500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt securities. The debt restructuring allowed the Company to favorably adjust its debt maturities and reduce future interest costs on its long-term debt. The early repayment of debt resulted in a charge of $115 million, net. See Note 10, "Borrowings " and Note 11, "Early Debt Extinguishment Costs ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding debt issuance and extinguishment. For more information regarding interest rates, see Note 10, "Borrowings ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the Company made $102 million, $35 million, and $181 million, respectively, in contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term time deposits, and the other sources of liquidity described above are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors " below. The Company believes maintaining a financial profile consistent with an investment grade company is important to its long term strategic and financial flexibility. On January 26, 2012, in connection with its entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Solutia and in order to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition, the Company entered into an agreement with lenders which contains commitments for a $3.5 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility and sets out the principal terms of a senior unsecured term loan facility for up to $1.25 billion, with any commitments in respect of the term loan facility reducing on a dollar-for-dollar basis commitments under the bridge term loan facility. Final terms of this financing will be contained in definitive agreements relating to such indebtedness. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures were $457 million, $243 million, and $310 million for 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Discretionary spending on certain capital projects was deferred in late 2009 in response to the global recession. Capital expenditures remained at a level sufficient for required maintenance and certain strategic growth initiatives through first nine months 2010. In fourth quarter 2010, the Company increased spending on discretionary infrastructure projects and certain strategic growth initiatives to $110 million which carried into 2011. Capital expenditures in 2011 primarily increased due to organic growth initiatives, particularly in the Specialty Plastics, CASPI, and PCI segments. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects that 2012 capital spending will be between $400 million and $425 million. Excluding the expected impact of the acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects 2012 depreciation and amortization to be slightly higher than 2011 expenses of $273 million, primarily due to the completion of capacity expansions and a full year of depreciation on assets from 2011 acquisitions completed in 2011, including Sterling. Other Commitments At December 31, 2011, the Company's obligations related to outstanding indebtedness in the form of notes and debentures totaled approximately $1.6 billion to be paid over a period of approximately 15 years. 56 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company had various purchase obligations at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.4 billion over a period of approximately 15 years for materials, supplies and energy incident to the ordinary conduct of business. The Company also had various lease commitments for property and equipment under cancelable, noncancelable, and month-to-month operating leases totaling $105 million over a period of several years. Of the total lease commitments, approximately 10 percent relate to machinery and equipment, including computer and communications equipment and production equipment; approximately 60 percent relate to real property, including office space, storage facilities, and land; and approximately 30 percent relate to railcars. In addition, the Company had other liabilities at December 31, 2011 totaling approximately $1.6 billion related primarily to pension, retiree medical, other post-employment obligations, and environmental reserves. The obligations described above are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions ) Payments Due for Period Notes and Debentures Credit Facility Borrowings and Other Interest Payable Purchase Obligations Operating Leases Other Liabilities (a) Total (b) 2012 $ 147 $ 6 $ 87 $ 276 $ 27 $ 270 $ 813 2013 -- 81 264 20 51 416 2014 - -- 81 143 11 52 287 2015 250 -- 82 137 8 56 533 2016 -- 74 137 7 67 285 2017 and beyond 1,195 -- 454 461 32 1,100 3,242 Total $ 1,592 $ 6 $ 859 $ 1,418 $ 105 $ 1,596 $ 5,576 (a) Amounts represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other post-employment benefits and taxes payable in the periods indicated. The amount and timing of such payments is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. (b) Not included in the above table is the expected payment of approximately $2.7 billion in cash in order to complete the Solutia acquisition or any obligations to be assumed upon completion of the acquisition of Solutia. Off Balance Sheet and Other Financing Arrangements If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it has guaranteed a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Under these operating leases, the residual value guarantees at December 31, 2011 totaled $184 million and consisted primarily of leases for railcars and company aircraft. Leases with guarantee amounts totaling $139 million and $45 million will expire in 2012 and 2016 and beyond, respectively. The Company believes, based on current facts and circumstances, that the likelihood of a material payment pursuant to such guarantees is remote. As described in Note 7, "Equity Investments ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, Eastman has a 50 percent interest in and serves as the operating partner in Primester, a joint venture which manufactures cellulose acetate at Eastman's Kingsport, Tennessee plant. This investment is accounted for under the equity method. Eastman's net investment in the joint venture at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $28 million and $32 million, respectively, which was comprised of the recognized portion of the venture's accumulated deficits, long-term amounts owed to Primester, and a line of credit from Eastman to Primester. 57 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Company did not have any other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including special purpose entities, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements with contractually narrow or limited purposes. Thus, Eastman is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk related to the above or any other such relationships. The accounting guidance on consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("VIEs") is effective for all VIEs or potential VIEs the Company is involved with on or after January 1, 2010. This guidance amended the evaluation criteria to identify which entity has a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing reassessments. The Company has evaluated its material contractual relationships under this guidance and has concluded that the entities involved in these relationships are not VIEs or, in the case of Primester, a joint venture that manufactures cellulose acetate at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee plant, the Company has shared control of the VIE. As such, the Company is not required to consolidate these entities. Guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers, customers, and other parties when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others, if specified triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the Company. These potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products, intellectual property and environmental matters, and other indemnifications. The ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims. However, while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized, management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or liquidity. Treasury Stock On October 3, 2011, the Company distributed a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. For additional information, see Note 17, "Stockholders ' Equity " to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In October 2007, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $700 million for repurchase of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $700 million repurchase authorization in November 2010, acquiring a total of 22.4 million shares. In August 2010, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $300 million for the repurchase of the Company's outstanding common. The Company completed the $300 million repurchase authorization in June 2011, acquiring a total of 7.1 million shares. In February 2011, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined to be in the best interests of the Company. As of December 31, 2011, a total of 4,757,639 shares of common stock have been repurchased under this authorization for a total amount of approximately $202 million. During 2011, the Company repurchased 7,258,031 shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $316 million. Dividends The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.235 per share in first and second quarters and $0.260 per share in third and fourth quarters 2011 for a total of $0.990 per share in 2011. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.220 per share in first, second, and third quarters and $0.235 per share in fourth quarter 2010 for a total of $0.895 per share in 2010, and $0.220 per share for all quarters, for a total of $0.880 per share in 2009. The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.260 per share during the first quarter of 2012, payable on April 2, 2012 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2012. 58 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL Certain Eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment, storage, transportation, and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies. In connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites, the Company, along with many other entities, has been designated a potentially responsible party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which potentially subjects PRPs to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs. In addition, the Company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with Eastman's policies as described in Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Because of expected sharing of costs, the availability of legal defenses, and the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company accrues the minimum amount. This undiscounted accrued amount reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of $11 million to the maximum of $29 million at December 31, 2011. In addition to remediation activities, the Company establishes reserves for closure and postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and ash ponds. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. These future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. The best estimate accrued to date over the facilities' estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs is $28 million at December 31, 2011. GAAP requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation ("CARO") when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company has performed an examination of various asset categories as of December 31, 2011. Although it may have CAROs at certain of its facilities, including, but not limited to, the potential for asbestos abatement activities, the Company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos. The Company continues to monitor these conditional obligations, as well as any new ones that may develop, and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs. The recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 59 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Reserves related to environmental asset retirement obligations accounted for approximately 75 percent of the total environmental reserve at December 31, 2011. Currently, the Company's environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next 50 years. If the Company was to invest in numerous new environmental assets, or, these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the Company anticipated they would, the amortization on them would increase, and could have a material negative impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote, and does not anticipate, based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation, that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary. The Company's cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were $219 million, $200 million, and $173 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. These amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities, but also included $35 million in expenditures for engineering and construction in 2011. Cash expenditures in 2012 are expected to increase primarily as a result of full year integration of 2011 acquisitions and of the expected mid-2012 acquisition of Solutia, although no assurances of the timing of completion of this acquisition or the related cash expenditures can be provided. Other than potential capital expenditures at the Company's Kingsport, Tennessee facility related to regulations associated with controlling air emissions from boilers, the Company does not currently expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, although no assurances can be provided as to the timing or amount of any capital expenditures that may arise as a result of the completion of the expected acquisition of Solutia. Potential capital expenditures associated with boiler air emissions remain uncertain pending adoption of final regulations, but could increase average annual capital expenditures significantly over the next five years compared to recent historical levels depending on final regulation requirements and the Company's method of addressing those requirements. INFLATION In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market price, although derivative financial instruments were utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. The volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit. For additional information see Note 12, "Derivatives ", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures with the purpose of converging the fair value measurement and disclosure guidance issued by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement requirements along with amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for fair value measurements and disclosures. The Company has concluded that the new guidance will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings, Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, or related disclosures. 60 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In June 2011, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance related to presentation of comprehensive income. The standards update is intended to help financial statement users better understand the causes of an entity's change in financial position and results of operation. It is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The amendments eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The amendments require that all nonowner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The FASB amended this guidance in December 2011 to postpone a requirement to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statement where the components of net income and other comprehensive income are presented and reinstate previous guidance related to such reclassifications. Upon adoption, the Company will continue to present components of comprehensive income in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings. Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In December 2011, the FASB and International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued amended accounting guidance to enhance disclosure requirements for instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. It is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its disclosures. Since this new guidance will affect disclosure requirements only, the Company has concluded that it will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. OUTLOOK The Company expects to benefit from the strength of its businesses based on modest global economic growth and aided by the full year integration of 2011 acquisitions including Sterling and Scandiflex. The Company expects the volatility of market prices for raw materials and energy to continue and that the Company will continue to use pricing and hedging strategies to offset this volatility. The Company expects to continue with growth initiatives in all segments, as well as to continue to explore and invest in R&D initiatives at a corporate level that are aligned with macro trends in sustainability, consumerism, and energy efficiency through high performance materials, advanced cellulosics, and environmentally-friendly chemistry. The Company expects to complete the acquisition of Solutia mid-2012. This acquisition is subject to approval by Solutia's shareholders, receipt of required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Excluding the impact of the expected acquisition of Solutia, the Company expects: · capital spending to be between $400 million and $425 million for organic growth initiatives and maintenance; and · between $250 million and $300 million of free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends). Assuming mid-2012 completion of the Solutia acquisition, the Company expects full year diluted earnings per share in 2012 to be approximately $5, excluding acquisition-related costs and charges. See " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors " below. 61 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS AND RISK FACTORS The expectations under " Outlook " and certain other statements in this Annual Report which are not statements of historical fact may be "forward-looking statements" as defined in, and subject to the protections of, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These statements, and other written and oral forward-looking statements made by the Company from time to time may relate to, among other things, such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization; anticipated capital spending; expected depreciation and amortization; environmental matters; expectations regarding the completion of the acquisition of Solutia including our ability to achieve the expected benefits and synergies from the acquired businesses; pending and future legal proceedings; exposure to, and effects of hedging of, raw material and energy costs, foreign currencies and interest rates; global and regional economic, political, and business conditions; competition; growth opportunities; supply and demand, volume, price, cost, margin, and sales; earnings, cash flow, dividends and other expected financial results and conditions; expectations, strategies, and plans for individual assets and products, businesses and segments as well as for the whole of Eastman; cash requirements and uses of available cash; financing plans and activities; pension expenses and funding; credit ratings; anticipated and other future restructuring, acquisition, divestiture, and consolidation activities; cost reduction and control efforts and targets; the timing of, and benefits from, the integration of and expected business and financial performance of acquired businesses; strategic initiatives and development, production, commercialization, and acceptance of new products, services and technologies and related costs; asset, business and product portfolio changes; and expected tax rates and net interest costs. These plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions, including those mentioned with the specific statements. Such assumptions are based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends, management expectations, plans, and strategies, economic conditions and other factors. These plans and expectations and the underlying assumptions are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results. There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of any proposed acquisitions, and the timing or actual achievement of expected benefits from, integration plans relating to, and expected synergies from, acquired businesses. Actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in any forward-looking statement if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized. In addition to the factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward-looking statement. Additional factors not presently known to the Company, or that the Company does not currently believe to be material, may also cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. Adverse and uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company. While economic and financial market conditions have improved from those in 2008 and 2009, continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, particularly in Europe, may adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The Company's business and operating results were affected by the impact of the recent global recession, including the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. If the global economy or financial markets again deteriorate or experience significant new disruptions, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected; in addition the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives. 62 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect our financial results. The Company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures cannot eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations. In addition, natural disasters, plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities. The Company could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to manufacturing operations or related infrastructure. Significant limitation of the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as natural disasters, pandemic illness, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect our financial results. The Company has an extensive customer base; however, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of our largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers. Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require a significant use of resources in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives. The Company continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both internal (or "organic") development and acquisitions and joint ventures to diversify and extend the portfolio of our businesses. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization of new products and technologies, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, and alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance regarding the timing of completion of proposed acquisitions, expected benefits of proposed acquisitions, integration plans, and expected synergies therefrom. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed investments and projects. 63 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The pending acquisition of Solutia exposes the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, both before and after its completion, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. In connection with Eastman's agreement to complete the acquisition of Solutia, and during its pendency, the Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These risks include, but are not limited to: · that the Company may not complete the acquisition of Solutia on terms contained in the merger agreement, which could impact the purchase price to be paid, assets to be acquired, covenants relating to Eastman's or Solutia's operations, or timing thereof; · that the Company may continue to incur significant additional costs and expend significant additional time and effort prior to the closing and if the transaction is delayed or not consummated, the Company may not be able to realize any benefit therefrom; · that the Company may not be able to obtain the financing it intends to obtain in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; and · that Solutia can require Eastman to complete the acquisition in certain situations that could result in the Company incurring significant additional costs. In the event the Company does complete the acquisition of Solutia, it may become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These risks and uncertainties include that the Company: · will be required to incur substantial additional indebtedness in order to complete the acquisition of Solutia; · may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, or tax synergies expected from the acquisition of Solutia, or there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; and · may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate Solutia's businesses into Eastman's. Legislative or regulatory actions could increase the Company's future compliance costs. The Company's facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. The amount accrued reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Pending and proposed U.S. Federal legislation and regulation increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing sites will in the future be impacted by regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and energy policy, which legislation and regulation, if enacted, may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs. In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under " Outlook " and " Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors ," and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects. 64 ITEM 7A . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company") has exposure to market risks from changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations. To mitigate the Company's exposure to these market risks, Eastman has established policies, procedures, and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks. The Company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analyses, which measure the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and/or commodity prices. The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities, which include long-term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements. From time to time, to manage the Company's mix of fixed and variable rate debt effectively, the Company enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, these borrowings, investments, and swaps were predominately U.S. dollar denominated. The nature and amount of the Company's long-term and short-term debt may vary from time to time as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. For purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, the Company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the market risks associated with the fair value of interest-rate-sensitive instruments, assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately $145 million and $123 million, respectively. This exposure is primarily related to long-term debt with fixed interest rates. The Company's operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the Company conducts business. In order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk, the Company from time to time enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated, but not yet committed, export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies and enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures. It is the Company's policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2011, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $53 million, with an additional $5 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. At December 31, 2010, the market risks associated with cash flows denominated in foreign currencies assuming a 10 percent adverse move in the U.S. dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately $60 million, with an additional $6 million exposure for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates. Since the Company utilizes currency-sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions, a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions. The Company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy. To mitigate short-term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities, principally propane, natural gas, and ethane, the Company enters into option and forward contracts. At December 31, 2011, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $10 million with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. At December 31, 2010, the market risk associated with forward and option contracts for feedstock and natural gas, assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of 10 percent, was $6 million, with less than an additional $1 million exposure for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter. 65 ]]></c>

		<c><![CDATA[Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del’s Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: · Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; · Hardware, truck, towing and tool products; · Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys; · Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and · Work/recreational clothing and footwear. We operated 1,085 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 31, 2011. Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 1,000 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores, inclusive of recently identified small market locations. Approximately 55% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 45% are located in strip shopping centers. Fiscal 2011 was once again a year of strong performance for our Company. We achieved double-digit increases in both sales and earnings on top of last year’s record results. In fiscal 2011, our net revenues increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion compared to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010, and we increased our fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share to $3.01 versus $2.25 in fiscal 2010. We also ended the year with $199 million in cash and restricted cash after returning nearly $211 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Over the past five years we have experienced considerable sales growth, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.3%. We plan to open 90 to 95 new stores in 2012, a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.0%. We opened 85 new stores in 2011 and 74 new stores in 2010, a square footage increase of approximately 7.8% and 7.4%, respectively. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an “everyday value prices” philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong private label offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our product content and enhancing our customers’ online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complementary strategy to organic growth. Our store strategy features low initial capital expenditures, limited maintenance capital, and low occupancy and operating costs. The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2011 was approximately $1.2 million. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $82,000 for pre-opening costs. Our new stores are typically profitable in the first full year of operation and reach chain average in approximately five years. Our capital allocation strategy focuses first on capital expenditure requirements (to support growth and invest in existing facilities and improved information technology processes and systems), and promotes effective stockholder return through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $166.2 million and $96.5 million, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2012 to be approximately $160 million to $170 million as we continue to invest in new store growth, existing stores, distribution center capacity and information technology. 17 We place significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. Modifications of product offerings include increasing the quality and affordability of some items through strategic sourcing, improving our private label offerings and ensuring we have the best product mix in our stores based on the regional needs of our customers. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. 18 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Inventory Valuation: Inventory Impairment We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $590,000 in fiscal 2011. Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $860,000 in fiscal 2011. 19 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor’s product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During interim periods, the amount of expected funding is estimated based upon initial commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known. Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2011. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 31, 2011, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.1 million. 20 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $2.0 million in fiscal 2011. Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state. We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. Our sales tax audit assessment methodology remained materially consistent in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 31, 2011, would have affected net income by approximately $720,000 in fiscal 2011. 21 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 31, 2011 would have affected net income by approximately $460,000 in fiscal 2011. 22 Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 23 Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2011 and 2010 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): First Quarter (13 weeks) Second Quarter (13 weeks) Third Quarter (13 weeks) Fourth Quarter (14 weeks) Total 2011 Net sales $ 836,576 $ 1,178,363 $ 977,776 $ 1,240,028 $ 4,232,743 Gross margin 273,606 402,497 327,603 403,166 1,406,872 Operating income 28,766 144,263 68,129 111,545 352,703 Net income 18,335 91,160 42,733 70,512 222,740 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.25 $ 1.27 $ 0.60 $ 0.99 $ 3.10 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 1.23 $ 0.58 $ 0.96 $ 3.01 Same-store sales increase 10.7 % 4.6 % 11.5 % 7.6 % 8.2 % First Quarter (13 weeks) Second Quarter (13 weeks) Third Quarter (13 weeks) Fourth Quarter (13 weeks) Total 2010 Net sales $ 710,917 $ 1,065,656 $ 829,114 $ 1,032,649 $ 3,638,336 Gross margin 230,931 360,129 275,688 336,917 1,203,665 Operating income 16,467 123,648 47,407 78,702 266,224 Net income 10,582 77,318 29,863 50,209 167,972 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.15 $ 1.06 $ 0.41 $ 0.69 $ 2.31 Diluted $ 0.14 $ 1.04 $ 0.40 $ 0.67 $ 2.25 Same-store sales increase 2.8 % 6.1 % 5.0 % 13.1 % 7.0 % (1) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. 24 Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks while fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 contained 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2011 2010 2009 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a) 66.8 66.9 67.5 Gross margin (a) 33.2 33.1 32.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 23.0 23.9 24.4 Depreciation and amortization 1.9 1.9 2.1 Operating income 8.3 7.3 6.0 Interest expense, net -- -- 0.1 Income before income taxes 8.3 7.3 5.9 Income tax provision 3.0 2.7 2.2 Net income 5.3 % 4.6 % 3.7 % (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses; refer to Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010. This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011. The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise. Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast. We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories. Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points. Store growth was approximately 8.4%, a net increase of 84 stores since December 25, 2010. Non-comp sales (defined as stores opened less than one year) for fiscal 2011 were $237.5 million, a 6.4% increase over total fiscal 2010 net sales. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales. In fiscal 2011, we opened 85 new stores (compared to 74 new stores in fiscal 2010), relocated three stores (compared to no relocations in fiscal 2010) and closed one store (compared to three closed stores in fiscal 2010). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010: Percent of Sales Product Category: 2011 2010 Livestock and Pet 40 % 39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 21 22 Clothing and Footwear 10 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % 25 Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs. Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, private branding and price optimization. We expect the effects of inflation to continue into and potentially throughout the remainder of fiscal 2012. Additionally, we expect transportation costs to continue to increase as a result of rising fuel costs and planned increases in our import volume as a percent of total purchases. However, we expect that we will be able to maintain reasonable margins through effective sourcing of product and retail price management. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010. The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales for fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs. Total SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system. The Company’s new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009. Same-store sales for fiscal 2010 were $3.43 billion, a 7.0% increase over fiscal 2009. This compares to a 1.1% same-store sales decrease in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store average ticket decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010. The same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment. New store growth was approximately 7.6% or 71 net stores opened since December 26, 2009. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2010 were $205.4 million, a 6.5% increase over total fiscal 2009 net sales. Non-comp sales for fiscal 2009 were $230.7 million, a 7.7% increase over total fiscal 2008 net sales. In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two relocations in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one closed store in fiscal 2009). The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2010 and 2009: Percent of Sales Product Category: 2010 2009 Livestock and Pet 39 % 39 % Hardware, Tools and Truck 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 22 22 Clothing and Footwear 10 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 60 basis points to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The direct product margin improvement resulted from progress on certain margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing. 26 As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009. The SG&A improvement as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense. Total SG&A expenses increased 10.2% to $937.4 million from $850.3 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales growth and increased incentive compensation. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock at a total cost of $38.2 million as part of our previously announced share repurchase program. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively. Working Capital At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $629.6 million, a $12.5 million increase from December 25, 2010. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2011 2010 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 176.9 $ 257.3 $ (80.4 ) Restricted cash 21.9 -- 21.9 Short-term investments -- 15.9 (15.9 ) Inventories 830.8 736.5 94.3 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 51.7 34.0 17.7 Deferred income taxes 8.9 -- 8.9 1,090.2 1,043.7 46.5 Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 266.4 $ 247.4 $ 19.0 Accrued employee compensation 48.3 34.6 13.7 Other accrued expenses 134.0 127.4 6.6 Current portion of capital lease obligation -- 0.1 (0.1 ) Income taxes payable 11.9 8.3 3.6 Deferred income taxes -- 8.8 (8.8 ) 460.6 426.6 34.0 Working capital $ 629.6 $ 617.1 $ 12.5 In comparison to prior year-end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in cash. The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth and inflation. Average inventory per store increased to $723,000 for fiscal 2011 compared to $709,000 for fiscal 2010. The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to an increased volume of share repurchases as well as an increase in capital expenditures, principally due to the construction of a new distribution center. 27 Borrowings and Credit Facilities Through October 23, 2011 we were party to a Senior Credit Facility (the “Credit Agreement”), which provided for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively) with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters. The Credit Agreement had an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments). The Credit Agreement was unsecured and would have matured in February 2012. On October 24, 2011, we entered into a new Senior Credit Facility with largely the same lender group as under the previous Credit Agreement. The new Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sublimits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016, with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters. At December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, there were no outstanding borrowings under either Senior Credit Facility. There were $15.0 million and $27.4 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at December 31, 2011) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) (0.30% at December 31, 2011) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio (0.50% at December 31, 2011). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, for unused capacity (0.10% at December 31, 2011). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense (“consolidated EBITDAR”) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent). The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR. The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2011. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company’s common stock and payment of common stock dividends. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 254.1 $ 222.6 $ 215.3 Net cash used in investing activities (171.3 ) (112.1 ) (73.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities (163.2 ) (26.0 ) (5.6 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (80.4 ) $ 84.5 $ 135.9 Operating Activities The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2011 2010 Variance Net income $ 222.7 $ 168.0 $ 54.7 Depreciation and amortization 80.3 69.8 10.5 Stock compensation expense 15.1 11.8 3.3 Deferred income taxes 1.9 2.7 (0.8 ) Inventories and accounts payable (75.3 ) (74.3 ) (1.0 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (17.8 ) (3.2 ) (14.6 ) Accrued expenses 20.0 38.5 (18.5 ) Income taxes payable 3.6 1.0 2.6 Other, net 3.6 8.3 (4.7 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 254.1 $ 222.6 $ 31.5 28 Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center. The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments. The increase in cash used for prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2010 2009 Variance Net income $ 168.0 $ 119.7 $ 48.3 Depreciation and amortization 69.8 66.3 3.5 Stock compensation expense 11.8 12.1 (0.3 ) Deferred income taxes 2.7 (11.1 ) 13.8 Inventories and accounts payable (74.3 ) (29.9 ) (44.4 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (3.2 ) 11.2 (14.4 ) Accrued expenses 38.5 22.3 16.2 Income taxes payable 1.0 7.8 (6.8 ) Other, net 8.3 16.9 (8.6 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 222.6 $ 215.3 $ 7.3 The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in cash provided by accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory, net of accounts payable, and a decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets. Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances. Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account. The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable. The increase in cash provided by accrued expenses is a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011. The decrease in cash provided by prepaids and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. Investing Activities Investing activities used $171.3 million, $112.1 million and $73.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Distribution center capacity and improvements $ 56.3 $ 22.5 $ 4.3 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened 44.9 28.6 31.7 Purchase of previously leased and self developed stores 32.2 11.6 -- Existing stores 18.7 17.6 18.4 Information technology 12.3 14.9 17.6 Corporate and other 1.8 1.3 2.0 $ 166.2 $ 96.5 $ 74.0 The above table reflects 85 new stores and three relocations in fiscal 2011, compared to 74 new stores during fiscal 2010. We also purchased 12 of our existing lease stores during fiscal 2011 compared to four existing stores in fiscal 2010. The increase in capital expenditures for distribution center capacity in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the construction of a new distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers. Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $160 million and $170 million in fiscal 2012. We plan to open approximately five to 10 more stores in fiscal 2012 compared to 2011. While we do not plan to open a new distribution center in fiscal 2012, we estimate to spend approximately $30 million on our distribution center network, principally for the acquisition of a site to relocate our southeast distribution center as well as other improvements in the existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems and other infrastructure enhancements. Additionally, we plan to invest approximately $30 million in information technology upgrades, including point-of-sale system enhancements, continued roll-out of the new warehouse management system to distribution centers, an upgrade of our e-commerce site, and store and store support center hardware refreshes. 29 Financing Activities Financing activities used $163.2 million, $26.0 million, and $5.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation. On April 28, 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $600 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized to date under the program to an aggregate of $1 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million, 0.8 million and 0.4 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $180.0 million, $38.2 million and $15.3 million in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. As of December 31, 2011, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $562.9 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.07 per share to $0.12 per share. We paid dividends totaling $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 1,620,771 $ 188,311 $ 358,343 $ 318,176 $ 755,941 Capital leases (1) 2,511 146 292 292 1,781 Purchase obligations (2) 9,413 9,413 -- -- -- $ 1,632,695 $ 197,870 $ 358,635 $ 318,468 $ 757,722 (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2012, as well as the purchase of a previously leased store. At December 31, 2011, there were $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $20.9 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash. The letter of credit outside the Senior Credit Facility will automatically increase by $1.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 bringing the total outstanding letter of credit balance to $21.9 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs. 30 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-08, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount (“qualitative assessment”). If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test. The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2011-08 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank’s base rate (3.25% at both December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010) or LIBOR (0.30% and 0.26% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% at December 31, 2011 and 0.35% to 0.90% at December 25, 2010) based on our leverage ratio (0.50% and 0.40% at December 31, 2011 and December 25, 2010, respectively). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% at December 31, 2011 and 0.06% to 0.18% at December 25, 2010) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.10% at December 31, 2011 and 0.08% December 25, 2010). Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores and our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season. Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services. Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions could adversely impact our financial performance. 31 ]]></c>
